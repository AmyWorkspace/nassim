    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFrame loss measurement is a performance monitoring function provided by MPLS-TP OAM. Single-ended frame LM is implemented on two MEPs of an LSP. Measurement results include the following data:\nNear-end frame loss data: indicates the number and percentage of dropped frames that are sent from an RMEP to a MEP.Far-end frame loss data: indicates the number and percentage of dropped frames that are sent from a MEP to an RMEP.\nPercentage of dropped frames = Number of dropped frames/Number of sent frames during the time specified by interval-value\nThe number of lost frames is the difference between the number of frames sent by the ingress and the number of frames received by the egress on a point-to-point LSP. For example, the lost-measure single-ended interval 1000 count 10 command is run to enable a MEP to send an LMM every 1000 ms for 10 times. Statistics about dropped frames will be displayed.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe ME of the MEG has been bound to a tunnel.\nPrecautions\nSingle-ended frame loss measurement and dual-ended frame loss measurement cannot be enabled together on a MEG."
