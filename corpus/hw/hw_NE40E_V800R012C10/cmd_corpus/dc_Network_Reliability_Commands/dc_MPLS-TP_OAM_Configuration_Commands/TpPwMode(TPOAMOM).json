    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe generic associated channel label (GAL) complies with relevant standards and is used to upload ACH packets. To set a detection mode for MPLS-TP OAM, run the mpls-tp mode command.\nIn standard mode, if an ME is configured to monitor a PW and the gal parameter is not set, a GAL value is not carried by default. If the gal parameter is set, a GAL value must be manually specified.In private mode, if an ME is configured to monitor a PW and the gal parameter is not set, a GAL value of 13 is carried by default. If the gal parameter is set, a GAL value must be manually specified.\n\nPrecautions\nA detection mode needs to be set only for L2VC MEs.If MPLS-TP OAM is used to monitor PW services, the detection mode cannot be switched."
