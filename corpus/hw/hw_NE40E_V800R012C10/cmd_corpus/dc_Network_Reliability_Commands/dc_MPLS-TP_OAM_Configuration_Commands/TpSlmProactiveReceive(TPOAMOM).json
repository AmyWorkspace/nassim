    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFrame loss measurement is a performance monitoring function provided by MPLS-TP OAM. Single-ended frame LM is implemented on two MEPs of an LSP. Measurement results include the following data:\nNear-end frame loss data: indicates the number and percentage of dropped frames that are sent from an RMEP to a MEP.Far-end frame loss data: indicates the number and percentage of dropped frames that are sent from a MEP to an RMEP.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe ME of the MEG has been bound to a tunnel.\nPrecautions\nSingle-ended frame loss measurement and dual-ended frame loss measurement cannot be enabled together on a MEG."
