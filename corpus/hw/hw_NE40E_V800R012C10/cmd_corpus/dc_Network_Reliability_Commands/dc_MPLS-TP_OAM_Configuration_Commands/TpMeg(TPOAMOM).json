    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMPLS-TP OAM is configured for a maintenance entity (ME). An ME consists of two MEPs on both ends of a transport path. MPLS-TP OAM detects faults in the ME between the MEPs.\nOne or more MEs using a single transport path belong to a MEG. The mpls-tp meg command must be run to create a MEG before OAM is able to monitor an MPLS-TP network.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the undo mpls-tp meg command is run to delete a MEG, all configurations for the MEG are deleted.\nPrecautions\nIf MPLS-TP OAM is already associated with an APS tunnel protection group, a MEG cannot be deleted."
