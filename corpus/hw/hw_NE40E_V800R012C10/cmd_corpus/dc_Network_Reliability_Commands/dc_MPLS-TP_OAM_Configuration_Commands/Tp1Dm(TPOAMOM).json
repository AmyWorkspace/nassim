    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDM is an MPLS-TP performance monitoring function. Four frame DM modes are supported.\nTo enable one-way on-demand frame DM, run the delay-measure one-way command.To enable one-way proactive frame DM, run the delay-measure one-way proactive command.To enable two-way on-demand frame DM, run the delay-measure two-way command.To enable two-way proactive frame DM, run the delay-measure two-way proactive command.\nOne-way proactive frame DM is implemented on a P2P link between a MEP and its RMEP. The MEP sends 1DMs to the RMEP and then receives replies from the RMEP. After the delay-measure one-way proactive command is run, the MEP sends 1DMs with the TxTimeStampf value at the interval specified by interval-value parameter. After receiving a 1DM, the RMEP parses the TxTimeStampf value and compares this value with the RxTimef value (the time when the 1DM was received). The RMEP calculates the one-way frame delay based on these values using the following equation:\nFrame delay = RxTimef - TxTimeStampf\nQuery one-way proactive frame delay statistics in either of the following scenarios:\nIf the delay-measure one-way proactive command has been run on the MEP, run the display mpls-tp oam meg statistic-type delay-measure one-way command on the RMEP to view statistics about one-way proactive frame DM in the direction from the MEP to its RMEP.If the delay-measure one-way proactive command has been run on the RMEP, run the display mpls-tp oam meg statistic-type delay-measure one-way command on the MEP to view statistics about one-way proactive frame DM in the direction from the RMEP to its MEP.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe ME of the MEG has been bound to a tunnel."
