    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFar-end frame loss: indicates the number and percentage of dropped frames that are sent from a MEP to an RMEP.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the mpls oam bidirectional-tunnel loss-measure oam-packet loss-ratio command is run, the system detects the packet loss ratio. If the packet loss ratio exceeds a specified alarm threshold, SD1-NEAR or SD2-NEAR alarms are reported. When an alarm is generated, APS is triggered on the protection ring. After the alarm is cleared, an APS switchback is triggered.\nPrecautions\nYou must configure alarm thresholds based on the actual link status."
