    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMPLS OAM is a fault detection mechanism used at the MPLS network layer. MPLS OAM provides the following functions:\nEffectively detects, identifies, and locates faults at the MPLS network layer.Quickly switches traffic if links or nodes fail to reduce the fault duration and improve network reliability.\nMPLS OAM can be configured to monitor the connectivity of LSPs and PWs and trigger tunnel switchovers. Before configuring MPLS OAM functions, you must run the mpls oam command to globally enable MPLS OAM.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe MPLS view has been displayed using the mpls command.\nPrecautions\nAfter the undo mpls oam command is run, all MPLS OAM configurations are deleted.\nBoth MPLS OAM and BFD or MPLS-TP OAM cannot be configured for the same TE tunnel or CR-LSP."
