    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPacket LM is a performance monitoring function provided by MPLS-TP. Single-ended frame LM is implemented on two MEPs over an LSP. The measurement results include the following data:\nNear-end frame loss: indicates the number and percentage of dropped frames that are sent from an RMEP to a MEP.Far-end frame loss: indicates the number and percentage of dropped frames that are sent from a MEP to an RMEP.\n\nPrerequisites\nMPLS and MPLS OAM have been enabled globally.The MPLS-OAM view has been displayed.The LSP that MPLS OAM monitors has been established.\n\nPrecautions\nThis function must be enabled on both the local and remote ends to display correct statistics about proactive single-ended frame loss measurement on the local end.The system can display a maximum of 60 proactive single-ended frame LM records.If the number of proactive single-ended frame LM records exceeds 60, the earlier records are overwritten."
