    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSR-MPLS TE LSP establishment does not require protocols. Therefore, an SR-MPLS TE LSP can be established as long as a label stack is delivered. If an SR-MPLS TE LSP encounters bit errors, upper-layer services may be affected.\nTo cope with link bit errors along an SR MPLS-TE tunnel and reduce the impact of bit errors on services, run the bit-error-detection command to enable bit-error-triggered SR-MPLS TE LSP switching. After this function is enabled, service traffic is switched from the primary SR MPLS-TE LSP to the backup SR MPLS-TE LSP if bit errors occur.\nPrecautions\nBefore you run this command in the BFD session view, ensure that the session type is BFD for SR-MPLS TE LSP and this function is supported and enabled on the peer end. If a BFD session has been configured to detect bit errors for the SR-MPLS TE LSP, you must delete the related BFD configuration before changing the SR-MPLS TE LSP type to common LSP.\nBit error detection and association between BFD and CFM or EFM cannot be configured for the same BFD session."
