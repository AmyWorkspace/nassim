    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a fault on a physical interface is detected by BFD and rapidly removed, the BFD session goes Down, whereas the physical interface goes Up. This causes some traffic to fail to be switched and then discarded. To prevent packet loss, run the bfd trigger if-down command to trigger a transient interruption on the interface, which ensures that all traffic is rapidly switched.\nPrerequisites\nA static single-hop BFD session bound to the interface has been created.The process-pst command has been configured to allow BFD sessions to modify the PST.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf BFD goes Down, the associated interface alternates between Up and Down."
