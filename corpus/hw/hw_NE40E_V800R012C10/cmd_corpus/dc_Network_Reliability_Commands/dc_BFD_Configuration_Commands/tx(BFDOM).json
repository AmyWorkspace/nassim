    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can increase or decrease the interval between transmitting BFD packets according to the actual network environment.\nIf no BFD packet is received within a configured detection period, the link that the BFD session detects is regarded as failed, and the BFD session status is set to Down. To reduce the usage of system resources, when detecting that the BFD session is Down, the system adjusts the interval between transmitting BFD packets to a random value greater than 1000 ms. After the BFD session becomes Up, the configured interval is restored.\nAsynchronous mode: Detection period = Received Detect Mult of the remote system x Max (Local RMRI, Received DMTI)\nwhere\nDMTI: indicates the desired minimum interval between sending BFD packets on the local end.RMRI: indicates the supported minimum interval between receiving BFD packet on the local end.Detect Mult: indicates the detection multiplier."
