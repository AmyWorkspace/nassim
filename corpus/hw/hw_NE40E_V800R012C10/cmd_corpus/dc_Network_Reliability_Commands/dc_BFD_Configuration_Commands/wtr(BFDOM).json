    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a BFD session flaps, you can run this command to decrease service flapping caused by the BFD session.\nPrerequisites\nA BFD session has been created.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the WTR time is configured, the event that the session becomes Up is reported to the applications after the WTR time expires. Other events are reported immediately.\nPrecautions\nThe WTR times on both ends of a BFD session must be the same; otherwise, when the session status changes on one end, the application on the other end detects the incorrect BFD session status.\nThe WTR time takes effect for BFD for link-bundle and BFD for per-link sessions, but not their sub-sessions, because the sub-sessions do not directly participate in service association.\nFor a BFD session group, the WTR time takes effect only for the session group. Sub-sessions do not directly participate in service association. Therefore, the WTR time does not take effect for sub-sessions."
