    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the system is congested, BFD control packets with a higher priority are preferentially sent. To change a priority of BFD control packets for a single static BFD session, run the tos-exp command.\nPrerequisites\nA BFD session has been created.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe priority of BFD packets changes.\nPrecautions\nIf the tos-exp command is run in the BFD session view to set a priority and the tos-exp command is run in the BFD view to set a priority, the configuration of the tos-exp command in the BFD session view takes effect.If the tos-exp command is run in the BFD session view to set a priority to 7 (the default value) and the tos-exp command is run in the BFD view to set a priority to a non-default value, the configuration of the tos-exp command in the BFD session view takes effect."
