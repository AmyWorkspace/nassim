    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run the bfd bind mpls-te command to configure static BFD for a TE tunnel between devices. However, before running the command, you must configure static BFD for TE on both ends of the TE tunnel and manually plan session discriminators for both ends through the discriminator command.\nTo configure a static BFD session with automatically negotiated discriminators to detect a TE tunnel or the primary or backup LSP bound to a TE tunnel, run the bfd bind mpls-te auto command. After a reverse TE tunnel is specified, BFD sessions at both ends can be associated with each other through tunnel information. If the command is run, the BFD sessions at both ends can dynamically negotiate discriminators. Therefore, you do not need to manually plan or configure discriminators.\nBFD detects faults in a TE tunnel or a primary or backup LSP bound to the TE tunnel.\nMultiple LSPs may be bound to a TE tunnel. If BFD is configured to detect faults in a TE tunnel, a BFD session will go Down only if all LSPs bound to the TE tunnel fail.\nOne-arm BFD echo is used when two devices are directly connected and only one of them supports BFD. A one-arm BFD echo session can be established on the device that supports BFD. After receiving a one-arm BFD echo session packet, the device that does not support BFD immediately loops back the packet, implementing quick link failure detection.\nWhen you create a one-arm BFD echo session, only the tunnel test is supported for SR-MPLS TE, and the LSP cannot be tested.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been enabled using the bfd command.The tunnel interface to which the specified BFD session is to be bound has been configured.\n\nPrecautions\nOnly one of multiple BFD sessions bound to an interface supports association with the interface status.\nIf the primary or backup LSP bound to a tunnel and detected by BFD is Down, a BFD session can be established but cannot go Up.\nIf the TE tunnel detected by BFD is Down, a BFD session can be established but cannot go Up.\nYou can run the undo bfd session-name command to delete a specified BFD session and its binding information."
