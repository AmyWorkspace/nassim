    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSBFD is a simplified BFD mechanism. If a fault occurs in a large-scale negotiation scenario, SBFD quickly detects the fault and notifies an upper-layer application of the fault.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been globally enabled using the bfd command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nIf SBFD has been enabled, you must disable SBFD before disabling BFD.\nRunning the undo sbfd command will delete all SBFD sessions. Exercise caution when running the reset bfd statistics command."
