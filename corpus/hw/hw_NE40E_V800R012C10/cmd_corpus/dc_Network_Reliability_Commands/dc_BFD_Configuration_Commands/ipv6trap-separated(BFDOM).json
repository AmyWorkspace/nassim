    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the BFD IPv4 and IPv6 sessions use the same trap messages to report alarms. If both BFD IPv4 and IPv6 sessions exist on a link and the traffic is heavy, trap suppression is triggered. When the session link status changes, only the IPv4 or IPv6 trap messages are reported. As a result, alarms are lost.\nThe ipv6-trap separated command adds trap messages for the BFD IPv6 session. When the BFD IPv6 session state changes between Up and Down, new trap messages are used to report alarms. The BFD IPv4 session uses the original trap messages for reporting alarms. In this manner, alarms for the BFD IPv4 and IPv6 sessions are separated, preventing alarms from being lost during traffic suppression."
