    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a BFD for TE-LSP or BFD for TE tunnel scenario, if the forward primary path is the same as the reverse backup path and the reverse primary path is the same as the forward backup path, path consistency occurs. If consistency check has been enabled for the forward and reverse primary and backup paths and the device detects this risk, the device reports an alarm. If the forward and reverse primary paths are the same and the forward and reverse backup paths are also the same, run the lsp-path-check disable command to disable consistency check for the forward and reverse primary and backup paths."
