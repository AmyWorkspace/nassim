    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAccording to relevant standards , a passive BFD session uses 4784 as the destination UDP port number by default. If Huawei device interworks with a non-Huawei device that is not implemented according to the relevant standards , run the passive-session udp-port command to change the destination UDP port number of a specified passive BFD session to 3784.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been globally enabled using the bfd command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the passive-session udp-port command is run to change the destination UDP port number of a passive BFD session, the original passive BFD session is deleted and then a passive BFD session is re-created based on the destination UPD port number of 3784."
