    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nWhen an mVRRP group is configured to ignore an interface Down event, the mVRRP group directly enters the Backup state. After the device restarts, the device switches to the Master state because it does not receive VRRP Advertisement packets before the interface goes Up. In this case, delayed switchback becomes invalid, and related service entries fail to be backed up. As a result, services are interrupted. For the preceding scenario, the mVRRP group remains the Initialize state before the interface goes Up for the first time by default.\nIf the interface always remains Down, the mVRRP group remains the Initialize state all the time. You can run the vrrp vrid initialize state-hold-time command to configure an Initialize state hold time for the mVRRP group. After the Initialize state hold time expires, the mVRRP group enters the Backup state.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAn mVRRP group has been configured to ignore an interface Down event using the admin-vrrp vrid command."
