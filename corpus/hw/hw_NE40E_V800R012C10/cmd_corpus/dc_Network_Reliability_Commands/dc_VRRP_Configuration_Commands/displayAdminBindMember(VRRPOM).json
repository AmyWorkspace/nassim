If the status of an object bound to an mVRRP group becomes abnormal, run the display vrrp binding admin-vrrp command to check the binding between the object and mVRRP group. The command output includes the bindings between an mVRRP group and a common VRRP backup group, between an mVRRP group and a VRRP-disabled interface, and between an mVRRP group and a service PW. It also includes the statuses of the mVRRP group, common VRRP backup group, VRRP-disabled interface, and service PW."
