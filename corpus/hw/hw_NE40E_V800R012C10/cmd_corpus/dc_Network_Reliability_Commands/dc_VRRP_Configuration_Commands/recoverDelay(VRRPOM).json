    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the status of the interface on which a VRRP backup group resides frequently changes, the VRRP backup group frequently flaps. To prevent this situation, run the vrrp recover-delay command to set a status recovery delay to suppress VRRP backup group flapping.\nPrerequisites\nAfter a status recovery delay is set for a VRRP backup group, the VRRP backup group responds to a received interface Up event only after the configured status recovery delay elapses, which prevents interface flapping from causing VRRP backup group flapping.\nPrecautions\nIf the vrrp recover-delay command is run in the system view on a device, the same status recovery delay is set for all VRRP backup groups on the device."
