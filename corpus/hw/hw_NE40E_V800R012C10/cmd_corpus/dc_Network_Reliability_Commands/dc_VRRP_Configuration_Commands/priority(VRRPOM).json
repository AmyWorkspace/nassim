    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nA priority determines the status of a device in a VRRP backup group. To configure a priority for a device in a VRRP backup group, run the vrrp vrid priority command. The device with the highest priority is the master device.\nA VRRP backup group works in either master/backup or load balancing mode.\n\nA single VRRP backup group can work only in master/backup mode. Devices in the VRRP backup group have different priorities. The device with the highest VRRP priority is in the Master state and the others are in the Backup state.\nTwo or more VRRP backup groups can work in load balancing mode. Each device has different priorities in different VRRP backup groups. Repeatedly configuring VRRP priorities allows different devices to function as master devices in different VRRP backup groups.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VRRP backup group has been configured using the vrrp vrid virtual-ip command.\n\nPrecautions\n\nPriority 255 is reserved for an IP address owner. The priority of an IP address owner is unconfigurable and fixed at 255.\nIf devices have the same VRRP priority, the device that enters the Master state earlier than the others is the master device. Other devices are backup devices and stop preempting the Master state."
