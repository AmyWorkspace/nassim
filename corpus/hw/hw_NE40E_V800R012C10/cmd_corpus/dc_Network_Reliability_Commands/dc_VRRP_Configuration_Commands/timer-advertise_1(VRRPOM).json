    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe master device in a VRRP backup group periodically sends VRRP Advertisement packets to the backup devices in the group to notify them of its status. You can run the vrrp vrid timer advertise millisecond command to set an interval at which the master device in a VRRP backup group sends a VRRP Advertisement packet to 500 ms.\nIf a backup device does not receive a VRRP Advertisement packet from the master device within a period three times as long as the interval at which the master device sends a VRRP packet, the backup device considers the master device Down and preempts the Master state.\nPrerequisites\nA VRRP backup group has been configured using the vrrp vrid command.\nConfiguration Impact\nChanging the interval at which VRRP Advertisement packets are sent affects the maximum number of VRRP groups supported per device. If VRRP Advertisement packets are sent both at intervals of seconds and milliseconds, the maximum number of VRRP groups that can be configured per device is calculated based on the minimum interval.\nPrecautions\nAfter you run the vrrp vrid timer advertise millisecond command, the function of learning the interval at which VRRP Advertisement packets are sent is not supported. To prevent VRRP negotiation failures and two master devices' coexistence, you must set the same interval at which the devices in a VRRP backup group send VRRP Advertisement packets.When CPU usage is high (a large number of configurations are restored or multiple services are deployed together), VRRP may flap because the system cannot promptly process VRRP Advertisement packets.A backup device's status changes due to heavy network traffic or timer differences.To prevent a large number of packets from being received due to slow MAC address update in a switchback, run the mac-address queue-emptying disable command on the downstream device to disable the MAC address queue clearing function so that the switch can learn new MAC addresses quickly. This prevents excessive packets during a switchback.If the device does not support sending VRRP Advertisement packets at an interval of 100 ms, after the vrrp vrid timer advertise millisecond command is run, the devices changes VRRP status to Init and stops sending VRRP Advertisement packets. Run the display vrrp state-change interface vrid command to check the VRRP status change. The change reason is No available active board."
