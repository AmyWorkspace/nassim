    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nTo set a multiplier of the interval at which VRRP Advertisement packets are sent for the timeout period of a backup device in a VRRP backup group, run the vrrp vrid holding-multiplier command.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VRRP backup group has been configured using the vrrp vrid command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nIf a VRRP backup group is not configured to monitor a service, a larger multiplier results in a longer timeout period for a backup device when the interval at which VRRP Advertisement packets are sent is the same.\n\nPrecautions\n\nIf a VRRP backup group is configured to monitor a service (for example, VRRP association with BFD or NQA), the vrrp vrid holding-multiplier command does not affect the timeout period of a backup device.\nIf a VRRP backup group is not configured to monitor a service (for example, VRRP association with link/peer BFD), a larger multiplier results in a longer timeout period for a backup device when the interval at which VRRP Advertisement packets are sent is the same."
