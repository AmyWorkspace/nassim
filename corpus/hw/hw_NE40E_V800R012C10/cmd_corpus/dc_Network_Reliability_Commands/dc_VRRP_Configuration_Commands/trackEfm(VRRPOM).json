    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nYou can configure a VRRP backup group to monitor a Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) session to implement a rapid master/backup VRRP switchover. However, this method does not apply to some networks or devices that do not support BFD. If a device does not support BFD but supports EFM, you can configure a VRRP backup group to monitor an EFM session. With such a configuration, if an EFM session goes Down, the EFM module notifies the VRRP backup group of the fault. After the VRRP backup group receives the notification, it performs a rapid master/backup VRRP switchover.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VRRP backup group and an EFM session have been created.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter the vrrp vrid track efm command is run, the EFM session status affects the VRRP status.\n\nPrecautions\n\nEach VRRP backup group can monitor only one EFM session. When VRRP backup groups monitor EFM sessions, they can no longer monitor link BFD or CFM sessions."
