    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Router allows user devices to ping a virtual IP address to serve the following purposes:\nMonitors the operating status of the master Router in a VRRP backup group.Monitors communication between a user device and a network connected by a default gateway using the virtual IP address.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the ping to the virtual IP address is enabled, a device on an external network can ping a virtual address. This imposes the Router to ICMP-based attacks.\nPrecautions\nAfter the undo vrrp virtual-ip ping enable command is run to disable the master device from responding to ping packets sent to a virtual IP address, the host route for the virtual IP address is deleted. As a result, services transmitted over the host route are interrupted. For example, after the undo vrrp virtual-ip ping enable command is run, the status of a GRE tunnel with the source IP address set to a virtual IP address changes to Down."
