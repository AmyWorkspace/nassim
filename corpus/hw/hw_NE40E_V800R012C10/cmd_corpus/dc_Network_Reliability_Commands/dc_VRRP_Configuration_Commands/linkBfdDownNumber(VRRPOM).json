    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIf a VRRP backup group is bound to multiple link BFD sessions and the vrrp vrid track link-bfd command is not run, the VRRP backup group performs a master/backup VRRP switchover only when all link BFD sessions go Down. To improve network stability and reliability, run the vrrp vrid track link-bfd command to set a threshold for the number of link BFD sessions tracked by the VRRP backup group that go Down.\n\nIf the number of link BFD sessions tracked by the VRRP backup group that go Down reaches or exceeds the specified threshold, the VRRP backup group performs a master/backup VRRP switchover.\nIf the number of link BFD sessions tracked by the VRRP backup group that go Down does not reach the specified threshold, the VRRP backup group does not perform a master/backup VRRP switchover.\nIf the number of link BFD sessions tracked by the VRRP backup group is less than the value specified by the parameter, the VRRP backup group performs a master/backup VRRP switchover only when all tracked link BFD sessions go Down.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VRRP backup group and a link BFD session have been configured."
