    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nTo enable a backup device with a higher priority to automatically become the master device in a VRRP backup group, you can configure the preemption mode for the backup device.\nIn non-preemption mode, if the master device in a VRRP backup group works properly, a backup device cannot preempt the master device though the backup device has a higher priority.\n\nIf the non-preemption mode is configured for a backup device in a VRRP backup group, the backup device does not preempt the master device even when detecting that the priority in a received VRRP Advertisement packet is lower than the local priority.\nIf the preemption mode is configured for a backup device in a VRRP backup group and the backup device detects that the priority in a received VRRP Advertisement packet is lower than the local priority, the backup device preempts the master device after the delay expires.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VRRP backup group has been configured using the vrrp vrid virtual-ip command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter the vrrp vrid preempt-mode disable command is run, the device in the specified VRRP backup group on a specified interface works in non-preemption mode.\n\nPrecautions\n\nExercise caution when running the vrrp vrid preempt-mode disable command to configure the non-preemption mode for a device in a VRRP backup group."
