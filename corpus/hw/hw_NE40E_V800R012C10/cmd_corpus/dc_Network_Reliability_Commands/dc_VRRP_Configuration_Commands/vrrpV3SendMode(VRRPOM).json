    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIf devices in a VRRP group use different VRRP versions, the VRRP group may fail to negotiate the status. This is because a VRRPv2-enabled device can only receive VRRPv2 Advertisement packets and discards the received VRRPv3 Advertisement packets. To resolve this issue, run the vrrp vrid version-3 send-packet-mode command to configure a VRRPv3-enabled device to send VRRPv2 Advertisement packets so that the VRRPv2- and VRRPv3-enabled devices can negotiate their status.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nA VRRP group has been created using the vrrp vrid virtual-ip command.\nThe VRRP version number of a device has been configured as 3 using the vrrp version 3 command.\n\n\nPrecautions\n\nOnly a VRRPv3-enabled device can be configured to send Advertisement packets of a specified version."
