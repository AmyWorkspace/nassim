    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn CGN cold backup scenarios, an HA backup group is bound to an HA status monitoring group to get aware of the CGN service board status. To configure a status change threshold for an HA status monitoring group, run the down-number command.\nPrerequisites\nAn HA status monitoring group has been created and bound to multiple HA backup groups.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe status change of an HA status monitoring group must meet threshold requirements. When the status change of a faulty HA backup group is greater than or equal to the threshold, the HA status monitoring group becomes Down and services are switched to a backup device. When the status change of a faulty HA backup group is less than the threshold, the interface status is restored.\nPrecautions\nThe down-number command only takes effect on VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400 series boards."
