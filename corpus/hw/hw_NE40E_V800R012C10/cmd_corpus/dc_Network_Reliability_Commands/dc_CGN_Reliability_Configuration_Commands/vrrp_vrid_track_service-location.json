    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn dual-device CGN hot backup scenarios, when a CGN board becomes faulty, a device fault is cleared, or a service-location backup group is deleted, CGN traffic may be interrupted. To address the problem, configure VRRP to track the service-location backup group status. Upon detection of a fault, VRRP adjusts its priority to perform a master/slave switchover. Then, the HA backup module is being notified of the master/slave switchover, triggering fast CGN traffic switchover. Traffic is transmitted on the new master device.\nPrerequisites\nThis command can take effect only when the following conditions are met:\nA service-location backup group has been configured.A VRRP backup group has been configured.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nThis command has the following impacts:\nWhen the service-location backup group being tracked is Down, VRRP decreases its priority based on the priority configuration. Then, the master and slave routers are re-elected.When the service-location backup group being tracked is Up, the master and slave routers are elected based on the original VRRP priority.When the service-location backup group being tracked is deleted, the master and slave routers are elected based on the original VRRP priority, and the binding relationship is deleted.\n\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S.\nOne VRRP backup group can be bound to a maximum of 16 service-location backup groups.\nIf a VRRP device is an IP address owner, the vrrp vrid track service-location command does not apply to the involved interface. If the VRRP device is not an IP address owner, you can run the vrrp vrid track service-location command to configure VRRP association with a service-location backup group. This configuration does not take effect only when the master VRRP device is an IP address owner.\nIn distributed CGN inter-chassis hot backup scenarios, you also need to run this command for the VRRP groups configured on user-side interfaces to enable association between VRRP and the CGN board status. This way, a master/backup BRAS switchover can be triggered if a CGN board fault occurs. If this command is not run, users may fail to go online through dialup."
