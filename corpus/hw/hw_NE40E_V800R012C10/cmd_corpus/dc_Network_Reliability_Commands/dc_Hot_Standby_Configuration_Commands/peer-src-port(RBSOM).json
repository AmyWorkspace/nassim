    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a device to use a TCP connection to send user information on the master device to the backup device, run the peer source port command to configure TCP connection parameters for an RBS. The parameters include the IP addresses of the master and backup devices and the interface number for the TCP connection.\nPrerequisites\nAn RBS has been created using the remote-backup-service command.\nPrecautions\nThe IP addresses of the master and backup devices must have been configured on their own interfaces, sub-interfaces, or logical interfaces (such as loopback interfaces) and can ping each other.\nThe interface numbers configured for a TCP connection must be the same on the master and backup devices."
