    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDual-device ARP hot backup is supported in E-Trunk scenarios by default. The local and peer ends of an E-Trunk establish a TCP connection to form a hot backup channel, implementing dual-device ARP hot backup.\nTo configure a TCP port number for a dual-device hot backup channel, run the backup tunnel port command.\nPrerequisites\nAn E-Trunk has been created and the E-Trunk view has been displayed using the e-trunk command in the system view.IP addresses have been assigned to the local and peer ends of the E-Trunk using the peer-address peer-ip-address source-address source-ip-address command.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nTo prevent a configuration failure, ensure that the specified TCP port number is not used."
