    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the CU separation UP dual-device hot backup scenario, if link 1 between two switches goes Down, the vBRAS-CP cannot detect the Down event and therefore do not switch traffic to the secondary link. As a result, traffic is overloaded or lost. To enable the vBRAS-CP to detect access-side link faults, configure peer BFD association so that a vBRAS-UP tracks the BFD session status to detect access-side link faults.\nPrerequisites\nA BFD session has been created using the bfd bind peer-ip command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the backup access-link track bfd command is run, if the BFD session is Down and the states of two vBRAS-UP's access-side interfaces are both Up, each vBRAS-UP sends a request message for becoming the master device to the vBRAS-CP. As a result, two master devices exist, and two switches' users go online through their connected vBRAS-UPs, respectively.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
