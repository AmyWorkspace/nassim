You can run the command to bind an RBP to a VRRP6 backup group.\nPrerequisites\nAn RBP has been created using the remote-backup-profile command in the system view.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the remote-backup-profile command in the interface view to bind the RBP to the interface with the VRRP6 backup group configured.\nPrecautions\nThe ID of the VRRP6 backup group bound with an RBP must be the same as the ID of the VRRP6 backup group configured on the corresponding interface."
