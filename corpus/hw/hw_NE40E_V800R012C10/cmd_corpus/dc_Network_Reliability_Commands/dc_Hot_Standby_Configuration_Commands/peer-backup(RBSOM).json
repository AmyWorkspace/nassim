    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe backup device supports the following backup modes:\nHot backup: After the backup device receives a backup message from the master device, it immediately generates user information and forwarding entries. When the master device fails, service traffic quickly switches to the backup device.Virtual backup: The backup device receives backup user information, which does not occupy user access resources. The backup device advertises only user routes and pre-assigns IP addresses. This mode is intended for dual-homing hot backup. However, single-homing access is deployed currently because resources are not met. Virtual backup must be deployed to prevent CoA/DM delivery and web authentication issues in single-homing access scenarios.\nTo configure a backup mode in which user information is backed up between devices, run the peer-backup command.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn RBP has been created using the remote-backup-profile file-name command."
