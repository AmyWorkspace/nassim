    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nYou can create a MIP in a maintenance domain (MD) to enable segment-by-segment fault locating and verification for the maintenance point (MP) or link.\nA MIP, residing inside the MD, does not send continuity check messages (CCMs) but can process and respond to CCMs. A MIP does not process packets with a level higher or lower than its level but forwards them as required; a MIP only processes packets with the same level as its level.\nIf a MIP is created and an MP performs Loopback or Linktrace, the MIP will reply with loopback messages (LBMs) or linktrace messages (LTMs) to perform segment-by-segment fault locating and verification for the MP or link in the MD.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nCFM has been enabled globally using the cfm enable (system view) command."
