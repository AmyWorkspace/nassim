    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nAfter the cfm trigger if-down command is run, when a MEP in a specified MA detects a connectivity fault on the network between the MEP and the specified RMEP, the OAM management module shuts down and then turns on the interface. If CFM detects a link fault in active and standby links, the CFM module instructs the OAM management module to run the shutdown command and 7 seconds later run the undo shutdown command automatically on the interface associated with the CFM module to allow services to be restored.\nWhen active and standby links are used, CFM detects link faults and the interface associated with CFM alternates between up and down, which facilitates rapid service convergence.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nCFM has been enabled globally using the cfm enable command.\nRun cfm md, creates an MD.\nRun ma, creates an MA.\nRun mep mep-id, configure a MEP.\nRun remote-mep mep-id, specifies an RMEP.\n\n\nPrecautions\n\nEach interface can be bound only to a single RMEP. To modify the binding between an interface and RMEP, delete the original binding and reconfigure a binding."
