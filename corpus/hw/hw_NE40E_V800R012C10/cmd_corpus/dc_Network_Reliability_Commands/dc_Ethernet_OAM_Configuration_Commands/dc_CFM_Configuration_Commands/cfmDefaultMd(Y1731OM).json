    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo use the LB and LT functions to detect link faults, run the cfm default md command to create a default MD.\nThe default MD must have a higher level than all MDs to which MEPs configured on the local device belong. In addition, the default MD must have the same level as a high-level MD. The default MD is used to transmit high-level continuity check messages (CCMs) and create maintenance association intermediate points (MIPs) to send linktrace reply (LTR) messages.\nAfter a default MD is created, a MIP are created in the MA that is not associated with a VLAN based on the default MD. The interface on which the default MD resides generates a MIP based on MIP generation rules.\nPrerequisites\nCFM has been globally enabled using the cfm enable command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nTo change the level of a default MD, delete the default MD and re-create a default MD. Deleting the default MD will delete all information about the MIPs associated with the default MD."
