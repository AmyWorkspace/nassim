    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDifferent customers have different requirements for quality of service (QoS) and link quality. Connectivity fault management (CFM) provides different intervals at which CCMs are sent to meet different carriers' requirements. To dynamically adjust the accuracy that CFM monitors link connectivity, configure an interval at which CCMs are sent. The implementation is as follows:\nA MEP sends CCMs at a specified interval. After receiving the CCMs, MIPs or RMEPs in the same MA obtain status information carried in the CCMs. If a local MEP does not receive a CCM from an RMEP within a period of 3.5 times the interval at which CCMs are sent, the local MEP considers the link between them faulty.\nPrerequisites\nAN MD has been created using the cfm md command.\nAn MA has been created using the ma command.\nPrecautions\nThe same interval must be configured on the MEPs in the same MD and MA."
