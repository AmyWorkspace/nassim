    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf EFM is deployed on one side of a device and CFM is deployed on the other side of the device, association between EFM and CFM can be configured on the device. This allows EFM and CFM to notify each other of faults and ensures reliable service transmission.\nAssociation between EFM and CFM is bidirectional. The details are as follows:\nIf EFM detects a link fault, it will notify CFM of the fault.If CFM detects a link fault, it will notify EFM of the fault.\n\nPrerequisites\nMDs and MAs have been created and EFM has been enabled on specified interfaces."
