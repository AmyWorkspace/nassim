    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCFM can advertise fault messages to interfaces or protocol modules. Ethernet OAM fault advertisement is implemented by an OAM manager (OAMMGR), application modules, and detection modules. An OAMMGR module associates one module with another. A detection module monitors link status and network performance. If a detection module detects a fault, it instructs the OAMMGR module to notify an application module or another detection module of the fault. After receiving the notification, the application or detection module takes measures to prevent a communication interruption or service quality deterioration. You can run the oam-mgr command to display the OAM management view before associating the CFM module and other modules.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAssociate the CFM module with other modules."
