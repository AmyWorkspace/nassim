    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn the network with an inward maintenance association end point (MEP) configured, Y.1731 is used to collect performance statistics about the network. If the interface on which the inward MEP is configured goes Down, you can run the ccm tlv interface-status command to enable CCMs to carry the Interface Status TLV field. Sending the CCMs with this field to a peer device enables the peer device to detect the network fault rapidly.\nAdditionally, running the ccm tlv interface-status command ensures communication between a Huawei device and a non-Huawei device that has the Interface Status TLV field carried in CCMs."
