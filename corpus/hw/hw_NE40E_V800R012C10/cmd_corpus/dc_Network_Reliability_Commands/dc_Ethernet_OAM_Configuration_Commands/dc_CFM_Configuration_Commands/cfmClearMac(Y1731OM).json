This allows links to be switched.\nPrerequisites\nCFM has been globally enabled using the cfm enable command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the cfm trigger vlan mac-renew command is run more than once, all configurations take effect.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of 10 VLAN ranges can be configured. The VLAN ranges cannot overlap or be crossed."
