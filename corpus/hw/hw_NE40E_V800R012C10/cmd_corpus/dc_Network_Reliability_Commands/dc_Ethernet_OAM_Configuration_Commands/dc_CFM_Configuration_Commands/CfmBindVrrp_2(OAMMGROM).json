    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve network reliability, associate CFM with VRRP. With this association, when CFM or VRRP detects a link fault, it instructs the MGR module to notify the other mechanism of the fault.\nThe association between CFM and VRRP can be unidirectional or bidirectional.\nIf the VRRP module detects a link fault, it instructs the CFM module to notify the remote end of the fault.\nIf the CFM module detects a link fault, it instructs the VRRP module to perform a link switchover.\nThe following commands are used when CFM is associated with VRRP:\noam-bind cfm md ma vrrp vridoam-bind ingress cfm md ma egress vrrp vridoam-bind ingress vrrp vrid egress cfm md ma\n\nPrerequisites\nCFM and VRRP have been configured."
