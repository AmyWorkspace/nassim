    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCFM has multiple versions. Huawei provides two CFM versions: IEEE 802.1ag Draft 7 and IEEE Standard 802.1ag-2007. To change a CFM version, run the cfm version command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the cfm enable command in the system view to enable CFM globally.\nPrecautions\nAll devices in the same MD must use the same CFM version. If different CFM versions are used, CFM packets fail to be transmitted between these devices.\nVersion switching deletes all CFM-related configurations."
