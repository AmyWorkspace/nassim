    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn the network Ethernet CFM is deployed between the PEs. If a fault occurs on the link between the PEs, a CE needs to detect the fault. Additionally, if a fault occurs between a PE and CE, the PE needs to notify the remote PE of the fault to ensure reliable service transmission. To meet the needs, deploy fault message transmission between Ethernet CFM and its bound interface on a PE. Table 1 describes configurations for fault message transmission between Ethernet CFM and its bound interface.\nPrerequisites\nAn MD and MA have been created.\ncfm enable (system view)cfm mdma\n\nPrecautions\nAfter you configure fault message transmission between Ethernet CFM and its bound interface:\nDisabling Ethernet CFM cancels fault message transmission between Ethernet CFM and its bound interface.Deleting the specified MA or MD cancels fault message transmission between Ethernet CFM and its bound interface."
