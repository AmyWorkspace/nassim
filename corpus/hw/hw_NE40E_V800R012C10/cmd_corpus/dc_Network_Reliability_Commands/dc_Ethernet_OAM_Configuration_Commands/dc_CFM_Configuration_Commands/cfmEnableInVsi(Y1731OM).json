    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn PBB VPLS, SPEs broadcast unidirectional multicast and unknown unicast packets to all VSIs in a VPLS domain. To suppress unidirectional multicast and unknown unicast packets, enable CFM for VSIs. After CFM is enabled, SPEs can learn the B-SMAC addresses of UPEs and unidirectionally forward unidirectional multicast and unknown unicast packets to UPEs.\nThe cfm enable command can only be configured in an I-VSI.\nPrerequisites\nCFM has been enabled globally using the cfm enable command in the system view.An AC interface has been bound to the I-VSI.The I-VSI has been bound to a B-VSI."
