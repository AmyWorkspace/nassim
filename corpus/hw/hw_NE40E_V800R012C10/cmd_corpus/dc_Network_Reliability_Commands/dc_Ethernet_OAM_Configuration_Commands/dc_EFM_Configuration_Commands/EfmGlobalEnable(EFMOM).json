    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can configure EFM OAM for link connectivity detection, link monitoring, remote fault notification, and remote loopback between two directly connected devices.\nEFM OAM is usually applied between CEs and PEs to ensure the reliability and stability of user and carrier networks.\nConfiguration Impact\nYou can perform EFM OAM-related operations only after EFM OAM is enabled globally.\nPrecautions\nAfter the undo efm enable command is run to disable EFM OAM globally, the device automatically deletes all EFM OAM-related configurations. If the undo efm enable command is run when the local device performs remote loopback and sends a large number of testing packets, a large number of testing packets may be forwarded."
