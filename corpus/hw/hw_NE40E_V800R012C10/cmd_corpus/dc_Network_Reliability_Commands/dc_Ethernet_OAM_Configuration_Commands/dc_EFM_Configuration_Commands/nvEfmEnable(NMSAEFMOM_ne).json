    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo implement continuity check, fault monitoring, remote fault notification, and remote loopback functions for the link between directly connected devices, configure EFM OAM.\nIn virtual access port-extension scenarios, EFM OAM can be applied between a CE and AP that are directly connected to ensure the reliability and stability of connections between user and carrier networks.\nPrecautions\nYou can perform EFM OAM operations only after enabling EFM OAM in the virtual access port-extension view.\nAfter the undo efm enable command is run in the virtual access port-extension view to disable EFM OAM, an AP automatically deletes all EFM OAM configurations."
