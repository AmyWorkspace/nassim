    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the efm error-code notification enable and efm error-code period commands are run, you can run the efm error-code threshold command to specify a threshold for the number of detected bit errors. When the number of detected bit errors within the period specified by period parameter reaches or exceeds the threshold specified by threshold parameter, the local device generates an alarm and notifies the peer device of the alarm event.\nPrerequisites\nEFM OAM has been globally enabled using the efm enable command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter a local interface is enabled to report detected bit errors, the local device generates a threshold-crossing event of bit errors and reports the event to the remote device if the number of bit errors detected on the interface reaches or exceeds the specified threshold.\nPrecautions\nIf the link quality is poor and the threshold for the number of detected bit errors is too small, the local device may frequently send the threshold-crossing event of bit errors to the remote device. If the threshold is too large, link monitoring may be of little effect. Therefore, the threshold for the number of detected bit errors must be set properly based on the link quality."
