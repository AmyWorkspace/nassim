    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the efm error-frame notification enable and efm error-frame period commands are run, you can run the efm error-frame threshold command to specify a threshold for the number of detected errored frames. When the number of detected errored frames within the period specified by period parameter reaches or exceeds the threshold specified by threshold parameter, the local device generates an alarm and notifies the peer device of the alarm event.\nPrerequisites\nEFM OAM has been globally enabled using the efm enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter a local interface is enabled to report detected errored frames, the local device generates a threshold-crossing event of errored frames and reports the event to the remote device if the number of errored frames detected on the interface reaches or exceeds the specified threshold.\nPrecautions\nIf the link quality is poor and the threshold for the number of detected errored frames is too small, the local device may frequently send the threshold-crossing event of errored frames to the remote device. If the threshold is too large, link monitoring may be of little effect. Therefore, the threshold for the number of detected errored frames must be set properly based on the link quality."
