    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a Huawei device communicates with a non-Huawei device, you can set the maximum size for an EFM OAM PDU to ensure successful EFM OAM session negotiation.\nPrerequisites\nEFM OAM has been globally enabled using the efm enable command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the size of a received EFM OAM PDU is greater than the configured maximum size, the OAM PDU is discarded as an invalid packet.\nPrecautions\nAfter the maximum size is set for an EFM OAM PDU, the actual maximum size of an EFM OAM PDU is negotiated by devices on two ends. If different values are set for the two devices, the smaller value is taken as the actual maximum size of an EFM OAM PDU."
