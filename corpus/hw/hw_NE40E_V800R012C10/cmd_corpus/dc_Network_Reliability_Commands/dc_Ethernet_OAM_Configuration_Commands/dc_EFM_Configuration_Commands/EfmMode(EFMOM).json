    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEthernet OAM connections can be established in either active or passive mode. The interface in active mode has more functions than the interface in passive mode, When Ethernet users access a service provider (SP) network, the SP network works in active mode. By setting the working mode of EFM OAM, you can configure whether a device can send or receive a specified type of EFM OAM PDU.\nPrerequisites\nEFM OAM has been globally enabled using the efm enable command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nOnly an interface in active mode can initiate peer discovery and remote loopback.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter running the efm mode command, you must run the efm enable command to enable EFM OAM on the interface."
