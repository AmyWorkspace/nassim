    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the efm trigger if-down command is run to associate EFM OAM with an interface, the EFM OAM protocol state of the interface does not change from Down to Up when a link connectivity fault is rectified. To change the EFM OAM protocol state of the interface from Down to Up, run the recover efm-down command.\nPrerequisites\nEFM OAM has been associated with an interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the recover efm-down command is run, the EFM OAM protocol state of an interface changes from Down to Up immediately after a link connectivity fault is rectified. The interface can then forward all packets and process all Layer 2 and Layer 3 services.\nPrecautions\nAfter the recover efm-down command is run on an interface, all packets on the interface are forwarded. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command."
