    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFault detection on an Ethernet network is difficult when the physical connection on the network is not closed but network performance deteriorates gradually. Link monitoring is used to detect link layer faults in various environments. After EFM OAM link monitoring is configured, statistics about the physical layer data of the interface management module are queried to monitor the quality of the link connected to the current interface. EFM OAM link monitoring implements the following functions:\nReports an alarm when the number of bit errors detected during a specified detection interval exceeds the specified threshold.Reports an alarm when the number of errored frames detected during a specified detection interval exceeds the specified threshold.Reports an alarm when the number of errored frame seconds detected during a specified interval exceeds the specified threshold.\nTo enable an interface to report detected bit errors, run the efm error-code notification enable command. The local device considers a link faulty if the number of detected bit errors within the period specified by the efm error-code period command reaches or exceeds the threshold specified by the efm error-code threshold command. Then the local device generates an alarm, reports the alarm to the NMS, and sends an OAM PDU to notify the peer device of the link failure.\n\nPrerequisites\nEFM OAM has been globally enabled using the efm enable command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter a local interface is enabled to report detected bit errors, the local device generates a threshold-crossing event of bit errors and reports the event to the remote device if the number of bit errors detected on the interface reaches or exceeds the specified threshold.\nPrecautions\nThe specified threshold and period take effect only after the efm error-code notification enable command is run.\nThe efm error-code notification enable command takes effect only after EFM OAM is enabled on an interface.\nThe efm error-code notification enable command can be used together with the efm error-code period and efm error-code threshold commands for bit error detection on a link."
