    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run the efm interval command to change an interval at which an interface sends OAM PDUs. The efm interval command is usually used together with the efm timeout command.\nPrerequisites\nEFM OAM has been globally enabled but has not been enabled on an interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nAn interface sends OAM PDUs at the configured interval.\nPrecautions\nWhen setting an interval at which an interface sends OAM PDUs, ensure that the same interval is set for interfaces on both ends of a link. Otherwise, EFM session negotiation may fail, or the EFM session may flap.\nThe interval at which an interface sends OAM PDUs cannot be changed after EFM OAM is enabled on the interface."
