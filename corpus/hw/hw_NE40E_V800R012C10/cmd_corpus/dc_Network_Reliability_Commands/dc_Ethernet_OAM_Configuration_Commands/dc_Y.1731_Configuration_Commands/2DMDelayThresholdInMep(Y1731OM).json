    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen proactive two-way frame delay measurement is used to measure the delay and evaluate the quality of links between MEPs, run the delay-measure two-way delay-threshold command to set the upper and lower threshold for delay statistics. If thresholds are set on a specified MEP and the link delay exceeds the upper threshold, an alarm is generated to alert a network administrator to adjust links to ensure service quality. If thresholds are set in a specified instance, the link delay exceeds the upper threshold or is lower than the lower threshold, the number of threshold-crossing events is counted. The display y1731 period-data command displays the number of threshold-crossing times.\nPrerequisites\nThe cfm md command has been executed to configure an MD. The ma command has been executed to configure an MA.\nPrecautions\nThis command applies to VLAN, VSI, and VLL scenarios."
