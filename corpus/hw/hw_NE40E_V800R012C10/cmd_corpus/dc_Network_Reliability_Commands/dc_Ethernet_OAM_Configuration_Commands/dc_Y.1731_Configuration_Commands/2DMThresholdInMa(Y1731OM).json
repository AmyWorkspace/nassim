    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe delay-measure two-way threshold command sets a delay threshold on a network enabled with two-way frame delay measurement. If the delay time exceeds the configured threshold, an alarm is generated and sent to the NMS. An administrator obtains alarm information and takes measures to rectify the fault that causes the delay to ensure service quality.\nThe delay-measure two-way threshold command can be used in the VLAN scenario.\nPrerequisites\nThe cfm md md-name command has been run to configure an MD, and the ma ma-name command has been run to configure an MA."
