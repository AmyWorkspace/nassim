    "FuncDef": "The y1731 pm-mode enable command enables performance management (PM) to manage Y.1731 proactive performance statistics. PM saves the statistics to generated statistics files and then sends the files to the NMS.\nThe undo y1731 pm-mode enable command disables the configuration.\nBy default, PM is disabled from managing Y.1731 proactive performance statistics.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the NMS that functions as the client obtains Y.1731 proactive performance statistics from a device that functions as the server, this mode involves a network security vulnerability.\nTo improve network security, run the y1731 pm-mode enable command to enable PM to manage Y.1731 proactive performance statistics.\nA PM-enabled device functions as the client, and the NMS functions as the server. This configuration allows the PM-enabled device to send Y.1731 proactive performance statistics to the NMS.\nConfiguration Impact\nStatistics about single-ended and dual-ended proactive frame loss measurement, and one-way and two-way proactive frame delay measurement are not saved by Y.1731 to statistics files and then sent to the NMS, but saved by PM to statistics files and then sent to the NMS."
