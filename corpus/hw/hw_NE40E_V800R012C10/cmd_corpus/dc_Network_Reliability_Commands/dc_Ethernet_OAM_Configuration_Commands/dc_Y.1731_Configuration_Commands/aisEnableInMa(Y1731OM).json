    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn MD nesting scenarios, if the MEP of a low-level MD detects a fault, the MEP sends an alarm to the NMS. After a specified period elapses, if the MEP of a high-level MD also detects the fault, the MEP sends an alarm that is the same as the one sent by the MEP of the low-level MD to the NMS. In this case, the MEP of the high-level MD needs to be suppressed from sending alarms to the NMS. You can enable the AIS function for the low-level and high-level MDs.\nPrerequisites\nAn MD has been created using the cfm md command.An MA has been created using the ma command. BI4\n\nPrecautions\nundo ais enable command will delete all AIS information for this MA."
