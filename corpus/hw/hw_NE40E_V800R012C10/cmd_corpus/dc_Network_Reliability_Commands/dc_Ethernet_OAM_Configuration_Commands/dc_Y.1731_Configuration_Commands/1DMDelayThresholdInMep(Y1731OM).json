    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe delay-measure one-way delay-threshold command can be used to set upper and lower thresholds for a one-way frame delay in proactive one-way frame delay measurement, which is used to measure unidirectional transmission delays for links between MEPs and monitor the quality of the links. If the delay on the links between MEPs exceeds the configured upper threshold, an alarm is generated and sent to the NMS. A network administrator uses the alarm information to rectify the fault that causes the delay and to ensure service quality.\nPrerequisites\nAn MD, an MA, and a MEP have been created using the cfm md, ma, and mep mep-id commands, respectively."
