    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn maintenance domain (MD) nesting scenarios, after the maintenance association end point (MEP) of a high-level MD receives an alarm indication signal (AIS) packet, the MEP does not send an alarm to the network management system (NMS). If the MEP does not receive any AIS packet within a period of 3.5 times the interval at which AIS packets are sent, the alarm suppression function is disabled automatically on the local device. After the ais suppress-alarm command is used to enable the alarm suppression function, the MEP performs the following operations:\nIf the MEP detects a link fault and sends an alarm to the NMS before receiving an AIS packet, the MEP sends only an alarm indicating that the link fault is rectified if the MEP detects that the link fault is rectified.If the MEP does not detect a link fault before receiving an AIS packet, the MEP does not send an alarm to the NMS if the MEP detects a link fault.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn MD has been created using the cfm md command.An MA has been created using the ma command.The AIS function has been enabled using the ais enable command."
