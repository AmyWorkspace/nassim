    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set alarm thresholds for one-way frame jitter in proactive one-way frame delay measurement, run the delay-measure one-way variation-threshold command. Proactive one-way frame delay measurement is used to measure the unidirectional transmission delay for links between MEPs and monitor the quality of the links. If the jitter on the links between MEPs exceeds the configured upper threshold, an alarm is generated and sent to the NMS. A network administrator uses the alarm information to rectify the fault that causes the jitter and to ensure service quality.\nPrerequisites\nAn MD, an MA, and a MEP have been created using the cfm md, ma, and mep mep-id commands, respectively."
