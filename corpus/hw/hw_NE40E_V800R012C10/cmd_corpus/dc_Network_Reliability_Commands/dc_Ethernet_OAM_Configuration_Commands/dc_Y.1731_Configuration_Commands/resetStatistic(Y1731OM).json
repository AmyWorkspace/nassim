After the period of time, run the display y1731 statistic-type command to view statistics.\nPrerequisites\nThe specified MA exists.\nConfiguration Impact\nRunning this command clears all Y.1731 statistics, and the cleared Y.1731 statistics cannot be restored. Exercise caution when running this command."
