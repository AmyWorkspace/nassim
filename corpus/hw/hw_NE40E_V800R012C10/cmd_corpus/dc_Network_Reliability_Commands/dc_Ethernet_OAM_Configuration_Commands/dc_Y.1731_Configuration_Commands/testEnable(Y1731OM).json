    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a newly built network, an ETH-test instance can be configured to test unidirectional on-demand services or diagnose on-demand-service interruptions. The test can verify the maximum bandwidth and bit error rate. To enable the ETH-test function, run the eth-test enable command.\nPrerequisites\nCFM has been enabled globally using the cfm enable command in the system view.An MD has been created using the cfm md command in the system view.An MA has been created using the ma command in the MD view.An inward-facing MEP has been created using the mep mep-id command in the MA view.\n\nPrecautions\nRunning this eth-test start command to start a test affects network service transmission."
