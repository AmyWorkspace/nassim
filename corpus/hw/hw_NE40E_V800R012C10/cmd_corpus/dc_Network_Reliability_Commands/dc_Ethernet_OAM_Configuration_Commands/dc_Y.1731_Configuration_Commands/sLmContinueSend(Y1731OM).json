    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nProactive OAM refers to OAM actions which are carried out continuously to permit proactive reporting of faults or performance results. Proactive OAM enables a device to keep periodically collecting packet loss statistics about a service flow on a link. To enable this function, run the loss-measure single-ended continual command. Configuring proactive single-ended frame loss measurement involves the setting of the remote MEP ID or destination MAC address, and interval at which LMMs are sent are specified. - If the local MEP has not learned the MAC address of the remote MEP, you must specify the destination MAC address for single-ended frame loss measurement. - If the local MEP has learned the MAC address of the remote MEP, you can specify the remote MEP ID for single-ended frame loss measurement.\nPrerequisites\nThe loss-measure single-ended continual command takes effect only after the following configurations are complete:\nRun the cfm version standard command in the system view to specify IEEE Standard 802.1ag-2007 for CFM.The CFM function is enabled globally using the cfm enable (system view) command in the system view.An MD is created using the cfm md command in the system view.An MA is created using the ma command in the MD view.An inward-facing MEP is created after the mep mep-id command is run in the MA view.A test instance is created after the test-id command is run in the MA view.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the configuration is complete, proactive single-ended frame loss measurement is implemented for links."
