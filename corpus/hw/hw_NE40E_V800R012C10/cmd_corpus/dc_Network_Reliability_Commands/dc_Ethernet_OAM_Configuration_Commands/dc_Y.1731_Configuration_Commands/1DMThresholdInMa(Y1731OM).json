    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an alarm threshold for one-way frame delay measurement that monitors link quality, run the delay-measure one-way threshold command. If the delay exceeds the configured threshold, an alarm is generated and sent to the NMS. An administrator obtains alarm information and takes measures to rectify the fault that causes the delay to ensure service quality.\nThe delay-measure one-way threshold command can be used in the VLAN scenario.\nPrerequisites\nAn MD and an MA have been created using the cfm md and ma commands, respectively."
