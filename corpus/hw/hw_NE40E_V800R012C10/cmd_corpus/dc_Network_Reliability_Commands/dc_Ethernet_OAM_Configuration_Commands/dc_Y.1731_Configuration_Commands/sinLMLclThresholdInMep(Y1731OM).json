    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEthernet frame loss measurement (ETH-LM) enables a local MEP and its RMEP to exchange ETH-LM frames to collect frame loss statistics on E2E links. ETH-LM modes are classified into near-end ETH-LM and far-end ETH-LM. Near-end ETH-LM applies to an inbound interface, and far-end ETH-LM applies to an outbound interface on a MEP. ETH-LM counts errored frame seconds to determine the duration for which a link is unavailable.\nThe loss-measure single-ended local-ratio-threshold command sets upper and lower thresholds for the near-end frame loss rate in proactive single-ended frame loss measurement. If the near-end frame loss rate exceeds the set upper threshold, an alarm is generated and sent to the NMS. A network administrator uses the alarm information to rectify the fault and ensure service quality.\nTo set the upper and lower thresholds for the near-end packet loss rate in single-ended frame loss measurement, run the loss-measure single-ended local-ratio-threshold command. If thresholds are set on a specified MEP and the near-end packet loss rate exceeds the upper threshold, an alarm is generated to alert a network administrator to adjust links to ensure service quality. If thresholds are set in a specified instance, the near-end packet loss rate exceeds the upper threshold or is lower than the lower threshold, the number of threshold-crossing events is counted. The display y1731 period-data command displays the number of thresold-corssing times.\nPrerequisites\nThe cfm md command has been executed to configure an MD. The ma command has been executed to configure an MA. The mep mep-id command has been executed to configure MEPs."
