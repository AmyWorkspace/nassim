    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the bit-error-detection command is run, if a local member interface reports a bit error alarm, both the local and peer member interfaces go down, and the local and peer Eth-Trunk interfaces disable the member interfaces from forwarding traffic. After the bit error alarm is cleared, the member interfaces go up, and the Eth-Trunk interfaces enable the member interfaces to forward traffic again. An Eth-Trunk interface goes down when the number of member interfaces in the Up state falls below the configured lower threshold.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter you run this command, run the mpls te reverse-lsp protocol rsvp-te ingress-lsr-id tunnel-id command in the tunnel interface view to specify the reverse tunnel for the current tunnel."
