    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nBFD for PW and BFD for LSP, two commonly deployed detection mechanisms in PW redundancy scenarios, can trigger the active/standby switchover of PWs only after detecting the loss of three consecutive BFD packets.\nTo resolve this problem, run the mpls l2vpn pw bit-error-detection command on both endpoints of an LDP PW to enable bit-error-triggered PW switching. Bit-error-triggered PW switching uses CRC to check the bit error rate and works with the TE hot standby LSP or PW to protect services transmitted over a PW, ensuring end-to-end service quality of a PW.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe mpls l2vpn command has been run to enable MPLS L2VPN.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter bit-error-triggered PW switching is enabled using the mpls l2vpn pw bit-error-detection command, the primary and secondary PWs respond to bit errors and perform an active/standby switchover as needed. In a scenario in which both the primary and secondary PWs are normal:\n\nIf the primary PW does not encounter a bit error event, the primary PW forwards traffic.\nIf the primary PW encounters a bit error event but the secondary PW does not, the secondary PW takes over traffic from the primary PW.\nIf the primary and secondary PWs both encounter a bit error event, the primary PW forwards traffic."
