    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an H-VPN scenario, to rectify continuous packet loss on UPEs and NPEs, you can run the bestroute bit-error-detection command to enable bit-error-triggered rerouting on the UPEs. With this function enabled, each UPE can detect bit errors on a tunnel to an SPE and switches traffic to the secondary tunnel to prevent traffic loss. After the tunnel bit errors are rectified, the UPE switches back to the primary tunnel.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a bit error event has occurred before you configure bit-error-triggered rerouting on the UPE, the UPE may select a path other to transmit traffic after you run the bestroutebit-error-detection command."
