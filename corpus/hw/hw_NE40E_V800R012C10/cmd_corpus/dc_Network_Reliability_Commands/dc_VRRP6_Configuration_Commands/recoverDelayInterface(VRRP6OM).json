    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIf the status of the interface on which a VRRP6 backup group resides frequently changes, the VRRP6 backup group frequently flaps. To prevent this situation, run the vrrp6 recover-delay command to set a status recovery delay to suppress VRRP6 backup group flapping.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter a status recovery delay is set for a VRRP6 backup group, the VRRP6 backup group responds to a received interface Up event only after the configured status recovery delay elapses, which prevents interface flapping from causing VRRP6 backup group flapping."
