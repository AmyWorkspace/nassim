    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nVarious devices deployed on a network on a large scale have different packet processing capabilities and modes. In VRRP6 scenarios, a VRRP6 backup group may contain Huawei and non-Huawei devices. After a Huawei device receives a VRRP6 packet, it calculates the packet's checksum based on the content including the IPv6 pseudo header. However, a non-Huawei device may calculate the packet's checksum based on the content excluding the IPv6 pseudo header. As a result, VRRP negotiation between the Huawei and non-Huawei devices may fail. To resolve this issue, run the vrrp6 checksum exclude pseudo-header command to configure the Huawei device to calculate the packet's checksum based on the content excluding the IPv6 pseudo header."
