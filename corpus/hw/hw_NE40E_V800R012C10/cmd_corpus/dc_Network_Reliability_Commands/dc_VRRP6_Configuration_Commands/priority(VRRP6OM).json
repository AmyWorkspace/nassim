    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nThe priority of a router determines its position in a VRRP6 backup group. After you run the vrrp6 vrid priority command to set priorities for the routers in a VRRP6 backup group, the router with the highest priority becomes the master router.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VRRP6 backup group has been created using the vrrp6 vrid virtual-ip command.\n\nPrecautions\n\nIf the routers in a VRRP6 backup group have the same priority, the router that first switches to the Master state becomes the master router. Other backup routers no longer preempt the Master state."
