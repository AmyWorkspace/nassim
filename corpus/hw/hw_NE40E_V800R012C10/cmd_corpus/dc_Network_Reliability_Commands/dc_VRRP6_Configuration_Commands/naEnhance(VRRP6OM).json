    "FuncDef": "The vrrp6 na enhance enable command enables enhanced sending of Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages for a VRRP6 group, so that when a backup device in the VRRP6 group assumes the master role, it sends an NA message for each virtual IPv6 address six consecutive times.\nThe undo vrrp6 na interval command restores the default configuration.\nBy default, this function is disabled. In other words, when a backup device in a VRRP6 group assumes the master role, it sends an NA message for each virtual IPv6 address only once.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a backup device in a VRRP6 group assumes the master role, it sends an NA message for each virtual IPv6 address once by default. To ensure that downstream switches can receive the NA messages to promptly update the destination MAC address and outbound interface, run the vrrp6 na enhance enable command to enable enhanced sending of NA messages for the VRRP6 group.\nAfter this function is enabled, when a backup device in the VRRP6 group assumes the master role, it sends an NA message for each virtual IPv6 address six consecutive times."
