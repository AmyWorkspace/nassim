    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nGenerally, hosts use a default gateway to communicate with external networks. If the gateway fails, communication between the hosts and external networks is interrupted. VRRP is a fault-tolerant protocol that allows logical devices to work separately from physical devices and implements route selection among multiple egress gateways.\n\nPrecautions\n\nOne virtual IPv6 address serves one separate user group, in which users have the same reliability requirements. This setting helps prevent the default gateway addresses from varying according to location changes of VRRP6 routers.\nWhen a VRRP6 backup group is configured on an interface, the first virtual IPv6 address assigned to the VRRP6 backup group must be a link-local address. That is, you must run the vrrp6 vrid virtual-ip link-local command before assigning other virtual IPv6 addresses to the VRRP6 backup group.\nIf you assign a virtual IPv6 address when creating a VRRP6 backup group, the system automatically deletes the VRRP6 backup group when all virtual IPv6 addresses for the VRRP6 backup group are deleted. If you do not assign a virtual IPv6 address when creating a VRRP6 backup group, the system does not automatically delete the VRRP6 backup group even if all virtual IPv6 addresses for the VRRP6 backup group are deleted."
