    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nTo set a multiplier of the interval at which VRRP6 Advertisement packets are sent for the timeout period of a backup device in a VRRP6 backup group, run the vrrp6 vrid holding-multiplier command.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VRRP6 backup group has been configured using the vrrp6 vrid command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nIf a VRRP6 backup group is not configured to monitor a service, a larger multiplier results in a longer timeout period for a backup device when the interval at which VRRP6 Advertisement packets are sent is the same.\n\nPrecautions\n\nIf a VRRP6 backup group is configured to monitor a service, the vrrp6 vrid holding-multiplier command hardly affects the timeout period of a backup device."
