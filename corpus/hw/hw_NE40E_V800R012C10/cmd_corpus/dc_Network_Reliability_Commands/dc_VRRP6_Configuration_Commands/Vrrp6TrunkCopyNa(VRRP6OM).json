    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the scenario where a VRRP6 group is configured on an Eth-Trunk interface or Eth-Trunk sub-interface, when a backup device in the VRRP6 group assumes the master role, it sends an NA message for each virtual IPv6 address to only one Eth-Trunk member interface by default. To ensure that downstream devices can receive the NA messages in time and improve network convergence performance, run the vrrp6 vrid na copy-to-member command to enable replication of NA messages for a VRRP6 group so that when a backup device in the VRRP6 group assumes the master role, it replicates each NA message to be sent to each Eth-Trunk member interface.\nPrerequisites\nA VRRP6 group has been created and assigned a virtual IPv6 address using the vrrp6 vrid virtual-router-id virtual-ip virtual-address command.\nThe VRRP6 group has been bound to an mVRRP group in unflowdown mode using the vrrp6 vrid virtual-router-id track admin-vrrp6 interface interface-type interface-number vrid admin-vrid-value unflowdown command."
