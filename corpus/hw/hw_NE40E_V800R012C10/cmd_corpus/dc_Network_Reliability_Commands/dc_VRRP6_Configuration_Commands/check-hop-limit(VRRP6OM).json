    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nAccording to relevant standards , a router checks the hop count in every received VRRP6 packet and discards a packet if its hop count is not 255.\nIf a non-Huawei device that does not support a hop count check sends a VRRP6 packet carrying a hop count other than 255 to a Huawei device that supports a hop count check, the Huawei device discards the packet. To resolve this issue, run the vrrp6 un-check hop-limit command to disable a router from checking the hop count in a received VRRP6 packet.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter the vrrp6 un-check hop-limit command is run on a router, the router does not check the hop count in a received VRRP6 packet.\n\nPrecautions\n\nTo prevent a router from being attacked by invalid packets, exercise caution when running the vrrp6 un-check hop-limit command."
