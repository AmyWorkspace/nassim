    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nThe master device in a vrrp6 backup group periodically sends vrrp6 Advertisement packets to the backup devices in the group to notify them of its status. You can run the vrrp6 vrid timer advertise millisecond command to set an interval at which the master device in a vrrp6 backup group sends a vrrp6 Advertisement packet to 500 ms.\nIf a backup device does not receive a VRRP6 Advertisement packet from the master device within a period three times as long as the interval at which the master device sends a VRRP6 packet, the backup device considers the master device Down and preempts the Master state.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA vrrp6 backup group has been configured using the vrrp6 vrid command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter the vrrp6 vrid timer advertise command is run, the master device in the specified vrrp6 backup group on a specified interface sends a vrrp6 Advertisement packet at a specified interval.\n\nPrecautions\n\n\nAfter you run the vrrp6 vrid timer advertise millisecond command, the function of learning the interval at which VRRP6 Advertisement packets are sent is not supported. To prevent VRRP6 negotiation failures and two master devices' coexistence, you must set the same interval at which the devices in a VRRP6 backup group send VRRP6 Advertisement packets.\nWhen CPU usage is high (a large number of configurations are restored or multiple services are deployed together), VRRP6 may flap because the system cannot promptly process VRRP6 Advertisement packets.\nA backup device's status changes due to heavy network traffic or timer differences.\nTo prevent a large number of packets from being received due to slow MAC address update in a switchback, run the mac-address queue-emptying disable command on the downstream device to disable the MAC address queue clearing function so that the switch can learn new MAC addresses quickly. This prevents excessive packets during a switchback.\nIf the device does not support sending VRRP Advertisement packets at an interval of 100 ms, after the vrrp6 vrid timer advertise millisecond command is run, the devices changes VRRP status to Init and stops sending VRRP Advertisement packets. Run the display vrrp6 state-change interface vrid command to check the VRRP status change. The change reason is No available active board."
