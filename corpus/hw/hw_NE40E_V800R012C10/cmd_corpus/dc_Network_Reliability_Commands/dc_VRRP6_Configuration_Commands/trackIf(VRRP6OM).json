    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nA VRRP6 backup group cannot detect changes in the status of a VRRP6-disabled interface. If a VRRP-disabled interface connected to a network fails, the VRRP6 backup group is unable to detect the fault and still forwards user packets through the failed interface, which results in service interruptions.\nTo enable a VRRP6 backup group to monitor a VRRP6-disabled interface, run the\nvrrp6 vrid track interface command. If a router or VRRP6-disabled interface connected to a network fails, a VRRP6 backup group detects the fault and performs a master/backup VRRP switchover.\n\nIf a monitored VRRP6-disabled interface goes Down, the router on which the interface resides increases or decreases its priority by a specified value and performs a master/backup VRRP switchover.\nIf a monitored VRRP6-disabled interface goes Up, the router on which the interface resides restores its priority.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VRRP6 backup group has been created using the vrrp6 vrid virtual-ip command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nWhen you enable a VRRP6 backup group to monitor a VRRP6-disabled interface, the specified increased value-increased or reduced value-reduced parameter affects the status of the VRRP6 backup group. The specified parameter value only needs to ensure that a master/backup VRRP6 switchover can be performed. For example, if the master router's priority is 120 and a backup router's priority is 110, you need to set the reduced value-reduced parameter to 20 only on the master router.\n\nPrecautions\n\nAfter you enable a VRRP6 backup group to monitor a VRRP6-disabled interface, an IP address owner's priority does not change because it is fixed at 255.\nYou can enable a VRRP6 backup group to monitor a VRRP6-disabled interface only when the network-layer protocol of the monitored interface is IPv4.\nIf a VRRP6 group is configured to track multiple interfaces, the priority of the device where the VRRP group resides is subject to the status of all tracked interfaces.\nMultiple VRRP6 backup groups can track the same interface. One common VRRP backup group can track a maximum of\nsixteen interfaces simultaneously."
