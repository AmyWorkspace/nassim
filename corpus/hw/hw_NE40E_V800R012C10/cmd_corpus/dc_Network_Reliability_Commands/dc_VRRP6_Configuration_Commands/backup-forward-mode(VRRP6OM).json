    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nOn a mobile bearer network, a base station is connected to aggregation devices over the primary and secondary PWs and to NPEs over the active and standby links. A VRRP6 backup group is deployed on both NPEs. If the aggregation device on the active link fails, service traffic switches from the active link to the standby link immediately, but a master/backup VRRP6 switchover is performed between both NPEs after a delay. Therefore, service traffic is lost before the master/backup VRRP6 switchover is performed. To resolve this issue and meet carrier-class reliability requirements, run the vrrp6 vrid backup-forward command to enable the backup NPE to forward service traffic. After the configuration is complete, the backup NPE forwards service traffic before a master/backup VRRP6 switchover is performed, which prevents service traffic loss.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VRRP6 backup group has been created using the vrrp6 vrid command in the interface view.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter the vrrp6 vrid backup-forward command is run, backup devices forward service traffic with a virtual MAC address as a destination MAC address. If a downstream switch broadcasts a packet with a virtual MAC address as a destination MAC address, backup devices also forward this packet. As a result, duplicate traffic is sent. Do not run this command on a non-mobile bearer network to prevent duplicate traffic.\n\nPrecautions\n\nYou can configure backup devices to forward service traffic on the master and backup devices in a VRRP6 backup group."
