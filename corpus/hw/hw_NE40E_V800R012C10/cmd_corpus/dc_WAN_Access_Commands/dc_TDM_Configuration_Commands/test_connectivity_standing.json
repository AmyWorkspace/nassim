    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a CES service is created on a serial interface, the PW status is Up, and the physical layer and protocol layer of the serial interface are Up. However, the CES service is still unavailable. Therefore, before running the CES service, you need to test the connectivity of the CES service.\nPrerequisites\nCES services have been deployed on the tested serial interface. This means that the serial interface has used TDM as the encapsulation protocol and joined the PW.\nThe physical layer status and protocol layer status on the serial interface are Up.\nThe PW which the serial interface joins is Up.\nLocal loopback has been configured on the corresponding interface, which is connected to the serial interface, on the other end of the PW.\nConfiguration Impact\nServices will be interrupted during the PRBS test because local loopback is configured on the other end. You need to manually cancel the local loopback configuration on the other end after the test is completed."
