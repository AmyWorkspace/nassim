    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe idle-code card command is used to set an idle code to be filled when jitter buffer underflow occurs. Underflow refers to the situation where packets need to be forwarded but packets in the jitter buffer are insufficient. The value of the idle code is meaningless and can be any value. When a service switchover is performed on a network and 0xFF is padded for jitter buffer underflow, an AIS alarm will be reported on the downstream device. To avoid misleading customers, run the idle-code card command to set an idle code other than 0xFF.\nIdle codes can be set only by CPOS subcard, not by PW."
