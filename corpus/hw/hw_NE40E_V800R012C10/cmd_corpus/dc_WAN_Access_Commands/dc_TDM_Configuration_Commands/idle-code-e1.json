    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn unstructured data transfer for CES scenarios (SAToP), to enable a local subcard to notify an AC-side device of network-side PW faults on the subcard, run the idle-code-e1 command to configure the subcard to send the bit stream 0xFF to notify an idle E1 channel timeslot. Then, if network-side PW faults occur, the subcard can quickly and continuously send AIS bit streams to the AC-side device.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on CR5D00C4CF70, CR5D00C8CF71, CR5D00C2CF70,CR5D00C2CF71 subcards."
