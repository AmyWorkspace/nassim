    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe link-protocol command allows you to configure the link layer protocol of a serial interface. Interface-related parameters must be configured in the interface view. Protocol-related parameters can be configured only after the correct link layer protocol is configured.\nPrerequisites\nThe physical parameters for the interface have been configured and the physical layer status of the interface is Up.\nConfiguration Impact\nServices carried by frames encapsulated with other protocols will be interrupted, and resources occupied by the services are released."
