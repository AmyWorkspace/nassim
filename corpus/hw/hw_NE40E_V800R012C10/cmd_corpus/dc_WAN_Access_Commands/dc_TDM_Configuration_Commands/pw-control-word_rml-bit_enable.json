    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a TDM PWE3 usage scenario, the pw-control-word rml-bit enable command configures whether the serial interface uses RML bits in PW control words to transparently transmit alarms. If alarms indicating continuous loss of frames are generated, the serial interface can transparently transmit alarms.\nPrerequisites\nThe link-protocol tdm command has been already configured on the serial interface."
