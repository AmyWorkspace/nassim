    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf two SDH networks both connect to a PSN, the two SDH networks can directly communicate over data communications channels (DCCs). No additional data communication network (DCN) channels are required in this case.\nAfter you configure the cep soh-transport enable command, some SDH SOH bytes can be transparently transmitted over the PSN by means of VC4 emulation. The SOH bytes that support transparent transmission includes E1, E2, F1, K1, K2, and D1 to D12.\nPrerequisites\nA CEP interface has been created using the using vc4 command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you configure the cep soh-transport enable command, the local end transparently transmits SDH SOH bytes to the remote end and parses the SDH SOH bytes received from the remote end.\nPrecautions\nSOH transport is a Huawei-specific feature and cannot be configured on other vendors' devices. SOH transport takes effect only if the cep soh-transport enable command is configured on the CEP interfaces of both the local and remote ends."
