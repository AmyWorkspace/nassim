    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn dual-device APS scenarios, PGP is used to exchange control information between devices. To prevent PGP packets from being frequently attacked, run the aps anti-replay enable command to enable APS anti-replay. When APS anti-replay is enabled, the HMAC algorithm is used for PGP authentication strings to improve dual-device APS PGP communication security.\nPrerequisites\nAn interface has been configured as the working or protection interface in an APS group.\nPrecautions\nTo successfully establish PGP negotiation, ensure that the command configuration is the same on both ends in dual-device APS scenarios."
