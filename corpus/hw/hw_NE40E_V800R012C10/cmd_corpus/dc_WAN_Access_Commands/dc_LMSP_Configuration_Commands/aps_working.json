    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an interface as the working interface in an LMSP group, run the aps working command. The working interface must be specified for the working link in an LMSP group.\nPrerequisites\nBefore you configure an interface as the working interface of an LMSP group, add the interface to the LMSP group.\nPrecautions\nIf single-chassis LMSP is used, particularly when the working and protection interfaces of an LMSP group are on the same Router, you do not need to configure peer-ip or local-ip when specifying the protection interface for an LMSP group.\nThe POS interface view does not support the peer-ip and local-ip parameter."
