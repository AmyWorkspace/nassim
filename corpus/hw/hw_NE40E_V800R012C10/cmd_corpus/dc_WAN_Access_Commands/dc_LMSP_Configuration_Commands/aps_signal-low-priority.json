    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn LMSP protection interface uses the K type in an LMSP packet to negotiate with the LMSP protection interface on the remote end. By default, the high-priority signal failure code for a switching request is used. If the low-priority code is used on the LMSP protection interface on the remote end, the high-priority code on the LMSP protection interface on the local end must be changed to the low-priority code using the aps signal-low-priority command.\nPrerequisites\nBefore you configure an interface as the protection interface of an LMSP group, add the interface to the LMSP group.\nPrecautions\nThe aps signal-low-priority command is run only on an LMSP protect interface. The priority of the code for a switching request on protect interfaces of both ends must be the same."
