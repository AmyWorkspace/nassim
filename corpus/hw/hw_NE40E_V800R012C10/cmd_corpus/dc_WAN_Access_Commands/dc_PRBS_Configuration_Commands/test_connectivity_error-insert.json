    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDuring an enhanced PRBS connectivity test, run the test connectivity error-insert command to inject bit errors into a PRBS bit stream. After bit errors are injected, check whether the number of injected bit errors are the same as that detected. If they are the same, the PRBS test is functioning properly.\nTo inject bit errors into a PRBS bit stream during a PRBS connectivity test, run the test connectivity error-insert interface command.\nTo stop injecting bit errors into a PRBS bit stream during a PRBS connectivity test, run the test connectivity error-insert abort interface command.\nPrerequisites\nAn enhanced PRBS connectivity test has started using the test connectivity interface { uni-direction | nni-direction } command."
