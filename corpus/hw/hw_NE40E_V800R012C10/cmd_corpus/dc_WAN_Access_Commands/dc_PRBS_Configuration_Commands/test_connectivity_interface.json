    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDuring site deployment or device maintenance, PRBS enhanced tests on CES service connectivity are performed when there is no BER tester. The tests are performed as follows:\nThe board supporting PRBS sends PRBS bit errors to a tested network.The bit errors are looped back to the original board over a loopback-enabled remote device on the tested network.Upon receipt of the bit errors, the PRBS monitoring module on the board analyzes whether the bit errors are the same as those before being sent and determines whether the links or devices on the tested network are working properly.\nYou can enter the Tab button to display the pattern-list when using the test connectivity command.\nAfter being deployed on a serial interface, sometimes CES services are unavailable although the PW status as well as the physical layer and protocol layer status of the serial interface are Up. Therefore, CES service connectivity needs to be checked before the services are run.\n\nPrerequisites\nCES services have been deployed on the tested serial interface. This means that the serial interface has used TDM as the encapsulation protocol and joined the PW.\nThe physical layer status and protocol layer status on the serial interface are Up.\nThe PW which the serial interface joins is Up.\nLocal loopback has been configured on the corresponding interface, which is connected to the serial interface, on the other end of the PW.\nConfiguration Impact\nServices will be interrupted during the PRBS test because local loopback is configured on the other end. You need to manually cancel the local loopback configuration on the other end after the test is completed."
