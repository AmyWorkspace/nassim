    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOptical fiber flapping on a physical interface causes HDLC link to flap between Up and Down frequently. This results in unstable link or network layers. To resolve this issue, configure the HDLC dampening function.\nThis function enables HDLC link dampening on an interface. Therefore, if the HDLC link flapping occurs, stability of the entire link layer and network layer can be guaranteed. If you do not want to use the HDLC link dampening function, run the hdlc dampening disable command to disable the function."
