    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter an IP-Trunk interface is configured, you can run the display trunkfwdtbl ip-trunk command to view the forwarding table of the IP-Trunk interface.\nThe forwarding table shows the forwarding status of the IP-Trunk interface. The forwarding table consists of the following items:\nMASTER: indicates master member interfaces.SLAVE: indicates slave member interfaces.If no slave interfaces are configured and IP-Trunk member interfaces other than the master interfaces are Up, these member interfaces are used as slave interfaces, as shown in the SLAVE column.If no slave interfaces are configured and no IP-Trunk member interfaces are Up, interfaces displayed in the SLAVE column are the same as those displayed in the MASTER column, that is, interfaces back up themselves.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn IP-Trunk interface has been correctly configured."
