    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe polling intervals set at both ends of a link must be the same. If the polling interval is set to 0 at both ends, the link detection is disabled.\nIf one end of a link does not receive any Keepalive packets from the other end within five polling intervals, the local end considers that the other end is faulty and sets the local interface to Down.\nIf a network experiences a heavy delay or severe congestion, you can prolong the polling interval to reduce the possibility of network flapping.\nA polling interval cannot be set on GE or Ethernet interfaces."
