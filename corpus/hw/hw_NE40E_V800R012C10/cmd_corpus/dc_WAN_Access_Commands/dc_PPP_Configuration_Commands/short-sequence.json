    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA sequence number in the packet header indicates the sequence of a fragmented packet. The header of an MP packet can use either a 12-bit short sequence number or a 24-bit long sequence number. To configure an MP-group interface to use the short sequence number contained in packet headers to perform negotiation, run the short-sequence command. Using short sequence number for negotiation shortens the packet length and improves communication reliability.\nPrecautions\nAfter the short-sequence command is configured, run the restart command or the shutdown and undo shutdown commands in sequence in the MP-group interface view for the configuration to take effect."
