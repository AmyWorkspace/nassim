    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen PPP is used on the network side, if the peer end has a requirement on the minimum length of a PPP packet, the ppp packet min-length command can be run to specify the minimum length of the PPP packet on the local end.\nIf the length of the PPP packet to be sent is greater than or equal to the configured minimum length, the PPP packet is sent with the actual length. If the length of the PPP packet to be sent is less than the configured minimum length, the PPP packet is sent with the configured minimum length.\nIf the peer end has no requirement on the minimum length of the PPP packet, do not run this command.\nPrecautions\nThis function only takes effect on LPUF-50A."
