    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe P2P connection is a simple form of Wide Area Network (WAN) connections. PPP supports point-to-point data transmission over full duplex synchronous connections. It is widely used because it provides user authentication, supports synchronous and asynchronous communication, and can be easily extended.\nPrerequisites\nInterfaces are connected, and physical parameters of the interfaces are configured so that the physical layer status of the interfaces is Up.\nPrecautions\nIf the link-protocol ppp command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
