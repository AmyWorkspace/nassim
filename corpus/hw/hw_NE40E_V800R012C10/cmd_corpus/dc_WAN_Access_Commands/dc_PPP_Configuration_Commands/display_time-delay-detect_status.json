    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter transmission delay detection is enabled on MP-group member links, the device sends a detection packet every second to detect the transmission delay on each member link. To view the transmission delay on each member link, run the display time-delay-detect status interface mp-group mp-group-number command.\nPrerequisites\nAn MP group has been created, and interfaces have been added to the MP group.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter transmission delay detection is enabled on MP-group member links, if the transmission delay on a member link reaches the configured threshold, the link stops transmitting service data. Therefore, you are advised to reserve backup member interfaces to ensure sufficient transmission bandwidth."
