    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nHuawei devices can negotiate with base transceiver stations (BTSs). The BTSs perform the negotiation by polling all protocols. When an MP negotiation is performed on a Huawei device, the device directly enters the Link Dead phase because it considers that the BTS configuration is incorrect. During the Link Dead phase, the device does not negotiate with the BTS. In this situation, it takes a long time for a successful negotiation between the device and BTS. To shorten the negotiation time, run the ppp timer link-dead command.\nIf it takes N seconds for a BTS to poll all protocols, it is recommended that you configure a value in the range of N to 2 x N seconds as the PPP LCP Link Dead duration.\nPrerequisites\nPPP has been configured as the link layer protocol of the interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the ppp timer link-dead command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one. After the configuration completes, the timeout period of the PPP negotiation changes."
