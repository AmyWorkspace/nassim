    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen excessive packets are to be transmitted through the MP-group interface, you can configure the forwarding priority for the packets received on the MP-group interface. In this manner, packets on the MP-group interface can be normally transmitted.\nBefore configuring the forwarding priority for the packets received on an MP-Group interface, shut down the MP-Group interface.\nWhen the total number of E1 channels that are bound to the MP-Group interfaces configured with forwarding priority is greater than 51, the forwarding priority cannot be configured on other MP-Group interfaces.\nPrecautions\nOnly the CR53-P10-2xcPOS/STM1-SFP/CR53-P10-24xcE1/cT1-DB100 subcards support this command."
