    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo increase bandwidth, enhance reliability, and perform load-balancing, run the ppp mp mp-group command to add physical interfaces to an MP-group interface.\nPrecautions\nWhen adding interfaces to an MP-group interface, note the following:\nThese interfaces must be added to the same MP-group interface in the same mode.The MP-group interfaces on both ends of an MP link must have the same number of member interfaces.After multiple interfaces are added to a local MP-group interface, the peer interfaces directly connected to these interfaces must be added to the peer MP-group interface.\nTo ensure that PPP renegotiates and all the interfaces are successfully added to an MP-group, restart all the interfaces after the configuration."
