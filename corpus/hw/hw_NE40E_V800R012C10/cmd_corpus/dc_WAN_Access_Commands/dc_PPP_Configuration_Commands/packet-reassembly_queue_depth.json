    "FuncDef": "The packet-reassembly queue command configures the depth of the packet reassembly queue on an MP-group interface.\nThe undo packet-reassembly queue depth command restores the default depth of the packet reassembly queue on an MP-group interface.\nBy default, the depth of the packet reassembly queue on an MP-group interface is 1. That is, a maximum of 512 packets can be stored in a packet reassembly queue.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen data packets of different sizes (such as IS-IS packets and voice data) are transmitted through the same MP-group interface, you can configure the depth of the packet reassembly queue on the MP-group interface according to the actual interface bandwidth and the difference between the largest-size packet and the smallest-size packet. This can avoid the disorder and loss of data packets caused by insufficient depth of the packet reassembly queue on the MP-group interface.\nPrecautions\nBefore configuring the depth of the packet reassembly queue on an MP-group interface, shut down the MP-group interface.\nOnly the CR53-P10-2xcPOS/STM1-SFP/CR53-P10-24xcE1/cT1-DB100 subcards support this command."
