    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe LCP status can be Up only if the endpoint discriminators of MP-group interfaces on the two ends are the same. If you do not want the MP-group interfaces to perform LCP negotiation, run the undo discriminator command on one MP-group interface to disable endpoint discriminator negotiation. Leave the default endpoint discriminator negotiation configuration unchanged on the other MP-group interface. The packets sent by the MP-group interface with endpoint discriminator negotiation disabled do not carry endpoint discriminators, and LCP negotiation cannot be completed. As a result, the MP link cannot be established.\nPrecautions\nThe undo discriminator command can take effect on an MP-group interface only after the shutdown and undo shutdown commands are run on the sub-channels of the MP-group interface."
