    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe interface MRRU used in LCP negotiation is closely related to the interface MTU:\nIf the MRRU of the peer MP-group interface is greater than or equal to the MTU of the local MP-group interface, the local MP-group interface keeps its MTU unchanged.If the MRRU of the peer MP-group interface is smaller than the MTU of the local MP-group interface, the local MP-group interface uses the MRRU of the peer MP-group interface as its MTU after LCP negotiation."
