    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDelay detection for MP-group member links enables the device to send a detection packet every second to detect the transmission delay on each MP-group member link. To set a transmission delay threshold, run the time-delay-detect threshold time-delay-threshold command. If the transmission delay on a member link reaches the threshold, services to be transmitted on the member link are switched to another member link.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the delay threshold changes, the device re-detects the delay on each MP-group member link. If the delay of a member link that is disabled from transmitting services falls below the new delay threshold, the member link is enabled to transmit services again."
