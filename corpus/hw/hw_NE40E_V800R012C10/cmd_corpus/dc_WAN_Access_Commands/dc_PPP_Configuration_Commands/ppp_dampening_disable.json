    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOptical fiber flapping on a physical interface causes the link or network layers to become unstable. This results in unstable link or network layers. To resolve this issue, run the undo ppp dampening disable command.\nThis command enables PPP link dampening on an interface. Therefore, if PPP link flapping occurs, stability of the whole link layer and network layer can be guaranteed. If you do not want to use the PPP link dampening function, run the ppp dampening disable command to disable PPP link dampening."
