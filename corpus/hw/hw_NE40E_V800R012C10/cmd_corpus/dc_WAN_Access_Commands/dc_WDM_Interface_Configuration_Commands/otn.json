    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOptical signals degrade during transmission on an OTN. You can run the otn command to configure an alarm threshold. If signal degradation reaches the threshold, the optical transmit unit or optical data unit reports an alarm to the NMS.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only by the admin VS."
