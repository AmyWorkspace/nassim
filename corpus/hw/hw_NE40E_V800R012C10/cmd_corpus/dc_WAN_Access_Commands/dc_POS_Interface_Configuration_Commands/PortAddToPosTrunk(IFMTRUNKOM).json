Otherwise, services on the POS-Trunk interface may be interrupted.\nThe link layer protocol of the POS interface has been configured as PPP.\nPrecautions\nIn APS and PW association mode, if a working POS interface leaves the POS-Trunk interface, traffic is interrupted.\nOnly physical attribute-related configurations, such as APS, shutdown, undo shutdown, and description, can exist on a POS interface."
