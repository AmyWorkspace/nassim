    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run the crc command to set the CRC code length of a POS interface. A POS interface can be configured with a 16- or 32-bit CRC code.\nCRC uses a high-precision algorithm to verify data consistency on the POS interfaces connecting two devices. CRC using a 32-bit CRC code is more precise than that using a 16-bit CRC code but consumes more resources.\nPrecautions\nCRC code lengths configured for POS interfaces connecting two devices must be identical. If CRC code lengths configured on two connected devices are different, a large number of CRC error packets will be generated."
