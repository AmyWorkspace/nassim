    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn networking application scenario, the speed of local interface should be the consistent with the remote interface to ensure the matched operating speed in both end of a link, which can solve the problem that POS interface in both end of a link transfer packets with low speed.\nPrecautions\nOnly the CR5D00P8UF70, CR53-P10-8xPOS/STM4-SFP, CR53-P10-4xPOS/STM1-SFP, CR53-P10-4xPOS/STM4-SFP subcard supports this command.\nThe configuration must be cleared in POS interface before changing its operating speed;To ensure the speed change configuration take effect, the POS interface must be shut down first, execute the command in second, and open the inteface in last.\nOnly the CR5D00P8UF70subcard supports the parameter 622."
