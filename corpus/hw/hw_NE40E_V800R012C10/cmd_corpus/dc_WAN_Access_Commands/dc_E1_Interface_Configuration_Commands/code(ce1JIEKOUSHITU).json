    "ExtraInfo": "AMI coding is the basic line coding technique, which was used widely in first-generation PCM networks, but suffers the drawback that a long run of 0's makes it difficult to extract timing signals.\nHDB3 coding retains all the advantages of AMI coding and overcomes the drawback of AMI coding that a long run of 0's makes it difficult to extract timing signals. Therefore, adopting HDB3 coding as the line coding of the PCM transmission system is recommended.\nWhen setting the encoding and decoding format, ensure that the local and remote ends are configured with the same encoding and decoding format."
