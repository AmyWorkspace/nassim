If the interface is a synchronous serial interface, ATM has been configured as the interface's link layer protocol.A PVC or PVP has been configured on the interface.The end-point attribute is configured for the connection point of the PVC or PVP on the device that initiates the connectivity test.Both the local and remote devices have an LLID configured using the llid command.\n\nPrecautions\nInterfaces that support ATM service connectivity tests include synchronous serial interfacesand IMA-group sub-interfaces channelized from a CPOS E1 interface and CE1 interfaces."
