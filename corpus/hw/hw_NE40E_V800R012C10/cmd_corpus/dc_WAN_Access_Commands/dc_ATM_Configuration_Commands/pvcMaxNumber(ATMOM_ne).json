    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nATM connections are logical connections, called VCs. To set the maximum number of VCs on an ATM interface, run the pvc max-number command. This configuration reduces resource consumption on the device. If the number of PVCs configured on the ATM interface reaches the maximum limit, PVCs can no longer be configured on the interface.\nThe configured maximum number of VCs is the total number of VCs on the ATM interface and its sub-interfaces.\nPrecautions\nThe pvc max-number command can be run in the view of a serial interface only after the link layer protocol of the serial interface is configured as ATM."
