Specifically, if the PVC/PVP status of the sub-interface becomes Down, the protocol status on the sub-interface is set to Down.\nThe undo atm-link check command disables link check on a sub-interface.\nBy default, link check is enabled on sub-interfaces.",

    ],
    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the PVC/PVP status of a sub-interface goes Down but the protocol status remains Up, traffic is discarded on this sub-interface. To allow the network layer to detect the PVC/PVP status change, run the atm-link check command to enable link check on the sub-interface. If the PVC/PVP status goes Down, the protocol status of the sub-interface is set to Down, preventing data loss.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe protocol status of a sub-interface is set to Down after the PVC/PVP status of the sub-interface goes Down."
