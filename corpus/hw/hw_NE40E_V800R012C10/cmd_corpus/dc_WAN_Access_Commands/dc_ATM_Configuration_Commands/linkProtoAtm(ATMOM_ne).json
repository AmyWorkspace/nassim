    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAsynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a high-speed transfer technology that combines the benefits of circuit switching with those of packet switching. It can provide a universal connection-oriented transfer mode suitable for various services between devices, such as routers and hosts.\nBefore configuring an ATM network, run the link-protocol atm command to configure ATM as the interface's link layer protocol.\nTo replace the original encapsulation protocol with ATM, run the link-protocol atm command.After ATM is configured as an interface's link layer protocol, if the interface is physically Up, its protocol status is also Up.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nServices carried by frames encapsulated with other protocols will be interrupted, and resources occupied by the services are released.\nPrecautions\nIf the link-protocol atm command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
