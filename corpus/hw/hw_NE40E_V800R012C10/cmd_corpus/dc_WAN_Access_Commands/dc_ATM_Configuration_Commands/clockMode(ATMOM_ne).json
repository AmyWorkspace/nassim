    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf two devices are directly connected using IMA-group interfaces, run the\nclock command to configure a clock mode for each IMA-group interface so that the two devices can communicate. An IMA-group interface can work in either of the following clock modes:\nCTC mode: All member links of an IMA group share the same clock source, which is either an external clock or the clock of a member link.ITC mode: Member links of an IMA group use different clock sources.\nConfiguring the IMA-group interfaces of the two directly connected devices to work in the same clock mode is recommended.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn IMA-group interface has been created."
