    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe transmitting and receiving ends of an IMA-group interface work in the following ways:\nTransmitting end: IMA receives ATM cells from the ATM layer and sends the ATM cells in circular order over member links of the IMA group to the peer device periodically.Receiving end: After receiving cells, the receiving end reassembles the cells into the original cell flow and transmits them to the ATM layer.\nTo set the number of ATM cells in an IMA frame, run the frame-length command. To ensure transmission efficiency on links, use the default configuration.\n\nPrecautions\nConfiguring the frame-length command interrupts traffic over member links in an IMA group. After you configure this command, the IMA group renegotiates and reestablishes IMA links."
