    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBandwidth on a physical interface (an IMA group or serial interface) is limited, which restricts the bandwidth allocated to PVCs configured. To maximize PVC bandwidth usage, you can run the service bandwidth-overload command to add logical bandwidth to the interface. After this command is run, the total bandwidth that can be configured on the interface is added.\nBandwidth for PVCs must meet the following requirements:\nBandwidth for each PVC cannot be greater than the physical interface's bandwidth.Total bandwidth for all PVCs must be lower than the sum of the physical bandwidth and logical bandwidth.\n\nPrecautions\nThe service bandwidth-overload is supported only on the main interface."
