    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn IMA group is a logical link that consists of one or more physical links. It provides more bandwidth than a single link. To allow an IMA group to work properly, run the min-active-links command to configure the minimum number of active links in the IMA group. If the number of active links in an IMA group is less than the configured minimum value, the IMA group status changes to Down.\nPrecautions\nThe minimum number of active links in an IMA group can be different but cannot be less than the configured values on the local and peer devices.\nThe configured minimum number of active links must be less than or equal to the number of links in an IMA group."
