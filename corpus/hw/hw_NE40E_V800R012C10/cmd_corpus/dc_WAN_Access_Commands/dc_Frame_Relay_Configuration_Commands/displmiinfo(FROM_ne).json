    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nLocal Management Interface (LMI) is a protocol that uses status enquiry messages and state messages to maintain link and PVC status, including adding PVC status information, deleting information about disconnected PVCs, monitoring PVC status changes, and checking link integrity. After LMI and parameters are configured on an FR interface, run the\ndisplay fr lmi-info command to check whether the configurations are correct.\nIf no interface is specified, configurations about all FR interfaces are displayed.If interface-type interface-number is specified, only information about this FR interface is displayed.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe LMI protocol and relevant parameters have been configured."
