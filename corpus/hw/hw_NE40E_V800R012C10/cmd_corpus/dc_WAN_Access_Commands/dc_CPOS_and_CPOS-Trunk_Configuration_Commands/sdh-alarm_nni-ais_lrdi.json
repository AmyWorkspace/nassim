    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn unstructured data transfer for CES scenarios (SAToP), to enable a local AC-side CPOS interface to notify a network-side device of TX fiber faults on the interface, run the sdh-alarm nni-ais lrdi enable command to enable the CPOS interface to send AIS bit streams to the network-side device when an LRDI alarm is detected on the interface. The fault information can then be quickly and transparently transmitted to the network-side device.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on CR5D00C4CF70, CR5D00C8CF71, CR5D00C2CF70,CR5D00C8CF72,CR5D00C2CF71 subcards.\nWhen a CPOS interface has been added to a aps-group, this function cannot be configured. When the using vc4 command is run on a CPOS interface, this function is not supported."
