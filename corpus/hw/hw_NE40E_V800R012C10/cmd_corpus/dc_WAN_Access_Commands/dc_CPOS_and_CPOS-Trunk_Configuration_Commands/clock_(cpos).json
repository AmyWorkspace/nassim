    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen CPOS interfaces on two Routers are directly connected, one CPOS interface must work in master clock mode and use internal clock signals, and the other CPOS interface must work in slave clock mode and use line clock signals.\nPrecautions\nLink flapping may occur if the clock works in improper mode."
