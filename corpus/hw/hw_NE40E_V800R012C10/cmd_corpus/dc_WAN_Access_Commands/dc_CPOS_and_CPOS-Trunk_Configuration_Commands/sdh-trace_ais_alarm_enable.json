    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the sdh-trace ais enable command is run:\nIf a J0_TIM alarm is generated on the local device, the local device sends an MS_RDI alarm to the remote device and inserts an AIS in the uplink direction. In TDM service scenarios, the local device also transparently transmits an Lbit to the remote PE.If a J1_TIM alarm is generated on the local device, the local device inserts an AIS in the uplink direction. If the sdh-trace rdi hptim enable command is run on the local device, the local device sends the HP_RDI alarm to the remote device. If the undo sdh-trace rdi hptim enable command is run, the local device does not send the HP_RDI alarm to the remote device. In TDM service scenarios, the local device also transparently transmits an Lbit to the remote PE.If a J2_TIM alarm is generated on the local device, the local device inserts an AIS in the uplink direction. If the sdh-trace rdi hptim enable command is run on the local device, the local device sends the LP_RDI alarm to the remote device. If the undo sdh-trace rdi hptim enable command is run, the local device does not send the LP_RDI alarm to the remote device. In TDM service scenarios, the local device also transparently transmits an Lbit to the remote PE.If an HPUNEQ alarm is generated on the local device, the local device inserts an AIS only in the uplink direction. In TDM service scenarios, the local device transparently transmits an Lbit to the remote PE.If an HPPLM alarm is generated on the local device, the local device inserts an AIS only in the uplink direction. In TDM service scenarios, the local device transparently transmits an Lbit to the remote PE.\nAfter the undo sdh-trace ais enable command is run:\nIf a J0_TIM alarm is generated on the local device, the local device does not send an MS_RDI alarm to the remote device or insert an AIS in the uplink direction. In TDM service scenarios, the local device does not transparently transmit an Lbit to the remote PE.If a J1_TIM alarm is generated on the local device, the local device does not insert an AIS in the uplink direction.
