    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an E1 channel of a CPOS-Trunk interface to work in clear channel mode, run the e1 unframed command. After an E1 channel is configured to work in clear channel mode, the E1 channel neither contains frame control information nor supports timeslots. It can be used only as a trunk serial interface.\nPrerequisites\nA CPOS-Trunk interface has been created using the interface cpos-trunk trunk-id command.\nPrecautions\nTo ensure a device's processing capability, a CPOS-Trunk interface can have a maximum of 256 trunk serial interfaces bundled.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
