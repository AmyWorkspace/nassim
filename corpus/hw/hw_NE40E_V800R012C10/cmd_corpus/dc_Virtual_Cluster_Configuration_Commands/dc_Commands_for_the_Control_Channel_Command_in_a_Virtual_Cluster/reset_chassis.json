    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo reset a chassis in a virtual cluster system, run the reset chassis command.\nImplementation Procedure\nAfter the reset chassis command is run, the system prompts you whether to continue. If you enter Y, the specified chassis starts to be reset. If you enter N, the specified chassis is not reset.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the reset chassis command is run, the specified chassis is reset and all boards in the chassis are also reset.\nIf chassis is not specified, the chassis on which the master main control board resides is reset. If the master and slave main control boards are located in the same chassis, the system is reset. If the master and slave main control boards are located in two chassis, a master/slave main control board switchover is performed.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nBefore resetting a chassis, back up important data on the chassis."
