    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen deploying a virtual cluster system, you must run the set chassis-id command to set a chassis ID for each chassis.\nImplementation Procedure\nAfter the set chassis-id command is run, the system prompts you whether to continue. Enter Y to continue. The configuration will take effect after the device restarts. Enter N to cancel the setting of the chassis ID.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe set chassis-id command does not take effect on a single chassis.\nIf chassis is not specified, a chassis ID is set for the master chassis.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRestart the device for the configuration to take effect.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
