When both the inter-chassis control link and data link fail, the slave chassis changes to a master chassis or boards in the slave chassis are reset.\nIf fast-preemption is specified, the slave chassis immediately changes to a master chassis.If slave-reset is specified, boards in the slave chassis are reset.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
