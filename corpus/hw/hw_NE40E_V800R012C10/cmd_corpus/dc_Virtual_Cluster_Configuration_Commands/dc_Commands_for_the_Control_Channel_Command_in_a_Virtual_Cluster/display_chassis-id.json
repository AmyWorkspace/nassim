    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen deploying a virtual cluster system, you can run the display chassis-id command to check whether the ID of each chassis meets requirements.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf chassis-id is not specified, the ID of the current chassis and its next startup chassis ID are displayed. If all is specified, all chassis IDs and next startup chassis IDs are displayed.\nFollow-up Procedure\nIf the value of next-run-chassis-id displayed in the command output is not as expected, you must run the set chassis-id command to change the chassis ID.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
