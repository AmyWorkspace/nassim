    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf load balancing among data channels in a virtual cluster is uneven, you can run this command to enable per-packet load balancing for data channels in the virtual cluster. The packets are evenly allocated to the links that participate in the load balancing based on the arrival sequence of packets. In this way, the data channels of the virtual cluster are evenly distributed.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
