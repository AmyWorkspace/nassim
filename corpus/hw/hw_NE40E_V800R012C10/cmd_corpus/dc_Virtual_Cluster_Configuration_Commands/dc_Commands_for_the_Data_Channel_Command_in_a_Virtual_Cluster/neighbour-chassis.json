    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen deploying virtual cluster, you must create an inter-chassis data channel group for data communication in virtual cluster mode. To specify a neighbor chassis for communication with the local chassis, run the neighbour-chassis command.\nPrerequisites\nThe local chassis and neighbor chassis are located in the same virtual cluster system and belong to the same data channel group.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
