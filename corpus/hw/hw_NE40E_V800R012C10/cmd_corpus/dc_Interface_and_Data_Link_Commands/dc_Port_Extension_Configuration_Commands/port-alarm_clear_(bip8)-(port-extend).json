    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the associated physical port is down after a CRC, SDH, receive, transmit, symbol alarm is generated on a port, the alarm cannot be recovered automatically. In that case, you can run this command to clear the alarm on the port. The port-alarm clear bip8-sd command clears alarms generated on a port and restores the port. The system does not save the configurations with this command. Therefore, configuration restoration is unnecessary.\nPrerequisites\nRun the port-alarm down (interface view) or port-alarm down (system view) command to enable the function to shut down the associated physical port when an alarm is generated.\nPrecautions\nThis command takes effect only when the corresponding alarm function is enabled. You can run the snmp-agent trap enable port command to enable the function to generate alarms for CRC, SDH, input, output, symbol errors on an interface."
