    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn port extension system:\nA master delivers the admin command to an AP, and the AP automatically runs the command and saves it to a configuration file. You do not need to run the command.\nPrerequisites\nA node has been configured as an AP using the role ap command if a management IP address is configured for an AP.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the admin command is run, AP automatically generates a loopback interface that has the management IP address configured. An unused maximum number among numbers supported by the master is selected for the loopback interface.Changing or deleting the management IP address of AP affects the management and control channels and forwarding tunnels in the port extension system.\n\nPrecautions\nWhen you directly log in to an AP:\nIf the AP has established a NETCONF channel to a master, the admin command cannot be run.If the AP has not established a NETCONF channel to a master, the admin command can be run.\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
