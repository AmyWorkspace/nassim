    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNodes in the port extension system have two roles: master and AP. A master establishes a channel, delivers a service, forwards traffic, and manages connected APs. After port extension is enabled, run the role master command to configure a node as a master.\nPrerequisites\nVirtual access port extension has been enabled using the port-extend command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nAfter the role master command is run, all local physical interfaces become four-dimensional interfaces. For example, dimension 1 in GigabitEthernet 1/1/0/1 indicates that the interface is a local interface. If a large number of interfaces and services exist on a device, a long time is taken for running this command and the configuration to take effect."
