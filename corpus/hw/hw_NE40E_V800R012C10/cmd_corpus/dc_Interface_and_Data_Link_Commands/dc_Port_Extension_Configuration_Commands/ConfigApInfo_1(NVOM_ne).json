    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe port extension system supports plug-and-play (PnP) for an AP. After an AP starts, it automatically enables the data communication network (DCN) function and uses OSPF to advertise its ESN and initial PnP status. After a master discovers the AP and identifies the initial PnP status, the master checks whether the AP's ESN has been locally configured. If the AP's ESN has been locally configured, the master starts the PnP process. To enable a master to uniquely identify an AP, run the esn command on the master to configure an ESN for the AP.\nPrerequisites\nAn ESN has been obtained from an AP.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you run the esn command and the AP with the specified ESN goes online, the master starts the PnP process during which the master uses the preset password to connect to the AP over STelnet.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
