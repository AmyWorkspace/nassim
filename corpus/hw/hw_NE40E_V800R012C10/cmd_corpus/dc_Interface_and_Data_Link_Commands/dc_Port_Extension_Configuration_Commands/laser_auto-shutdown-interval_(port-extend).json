    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the optical module is configured to disable the laser automatically and a link failure occurs, the optical module laser disables itself, and the system checks whether the link failure is cleared at two intervals (closetime-interval and opentime-interval). If you need to adjust the two intervals, run the laser auto-shutdown-interval command.\nclosetime-interval and opentime-interval are described as follows:\nclosetime-interval:If an LOS alarm is generated on the interface, the optical module disables the  laser automatically, and an alarm is generated, indicating that the optical module laser has been disabled. During closetime-interval, the system checks whether the LOS alarm persists.If the LOS alarm is cleared, the optical module enables the laser automatically, and the opentime-interval timer starts.If the LOS alarm persists, the optical module laser remains disabled.\nopentime-interval:When the closetime-interval timer expires or the LOS alarm is cleared during closetime-interval, the optical module enables the laser automatically, and the opentime-interval timer starts. During opentime-interval, the system keeps checking whether new LOS alarms are generated.If no new LOS alarms are generated, the optical module considers that the link failure has been cleared and goes back to the normal working state, and a clear alarm is generated, indicating that the optical module has recovered.If new LOS alarms are generated, the optical module disables the laser automatically, and the closetime-interval timer starts over.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThe optical module has been configured to disable the laser automatically using the laser autoshutdown enable command."
