    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the bip8-sd exceeds the alarm threshold, the system generates an alarm and sends it to the NMS. If the value of bip8-sd falls below the alarm clearance threshold (one order of magnitude lower than the alarm generation threshold), the system generates an alarm clearance message and sends it to the NMS."
