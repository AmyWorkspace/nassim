    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an upper threshold, lower threshold, detection interval for the SDH error alarm, run the trap-threshold sdh-error high-threshold low-threshold command. After this configuration is performed, a device generates an alarm and sends it to an NMS only when the number of SDH error frames sent or received by the device reaches the upper threshold for three consecutive detection intervals. The device sends a clear alarm to the NMS only when the number of SDH error frames sent or received by the device falls below the lower threshold for three consecutive detection intervals.\nPrecautions\nThe configured thresholds take effect only when the SDH alarm function is enabled. You can run the snmp-agent trap enable port sdh-error command to enable the SDH alarm function on an interface.\nThe value of high-threshold must be greater than or equal to that of low-threshold."
