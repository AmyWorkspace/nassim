    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen interfaces on two Routers are directly connected, one interface must be configured to work in master clock mode and use internal clock signals, and the other interface must be configured to work in slave clock mode and use line clock signals.\nPrecautions\nLink flapping may occur if the clock works in improper mode."
