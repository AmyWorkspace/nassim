    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn AP can be considered as a master's card in the port extension system. To enable a master to automatically discover and manage APs, run the ap-id command on the master to configure an AP for subsequent configuration and management.\nPrerequisites\nA node has been configured as a master using the role master command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you run the undo ap-id command, master is disconnected from the AP.\nPrecautions\nAn AP's ID must be unique on a master.After the undo ap-id command is run on the master that manages a specified AP, log in to the AP and run the reset pnp state command to clear the PnP state.It takes a long time for theundo ap-id command to take effect. When the device CPU usage is high, do not run this command.\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
