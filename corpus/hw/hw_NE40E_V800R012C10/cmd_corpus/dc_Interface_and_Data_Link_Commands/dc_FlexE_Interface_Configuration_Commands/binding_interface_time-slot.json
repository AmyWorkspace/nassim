    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo bind one or more 5 Gbit/s timeslots of a physical interface in FlexE mode in a FlexE group or one or more sub-timeslots in a 5 Gbit/s timeslot to a FlexE client, run the binding interface time-slot command. The bound timeslots or sub-timeslots constitute bandwidth of the FlexE client.\nPrerequisites\nA physical interface in FlexE mode has been added to a FlexE group using the binding interface command.\nTo bind sub-timeslots with the 1 Gbit/s or 1.25 Gbit/s granularity, ensure that the sub-timeslot granularity has been set to 1 Gbit/s or 1.25 Gbit/s using the set flexe sub-time-slot granula command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
