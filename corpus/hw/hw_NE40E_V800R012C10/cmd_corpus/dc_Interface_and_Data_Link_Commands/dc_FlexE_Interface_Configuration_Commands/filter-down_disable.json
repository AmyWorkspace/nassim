    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an interconnection scenario, the local interface determines whether to enable interface Down interrupt suppression based on the flag in LLDP packets sent by the peer interface. After this command is run, the local interface ignores the flag in LLDP packets sent by the peer interface and disables interface Down interrupt suppression."
