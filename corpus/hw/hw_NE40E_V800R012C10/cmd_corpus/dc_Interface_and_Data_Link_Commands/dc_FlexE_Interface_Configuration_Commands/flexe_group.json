    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the flexible Ethernet mode has been enabled using the flexe enable port command, you need to run the flexe group command in the system view to create an FlexE group so that the flexible Ethernet physical interface can be added to the FlexE group and bandwidth can be allocated to the FlexE client.\nPrecautions\nIf the bandwidth is bound to the FlexE client associated with the FlexE group, the undo flexe group command cannot be executed. In this case, you need to cancel the bandwidth for the FlexE Client and delete the physical interface from the FlexE group.\nThis command is supported only by the admin VS."
