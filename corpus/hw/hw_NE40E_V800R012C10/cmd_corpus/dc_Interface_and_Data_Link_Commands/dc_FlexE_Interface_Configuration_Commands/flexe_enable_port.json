    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA standard Ethernet interface's bandwidth is fixed, but a flexible Ethernet interface's bandwidth can be flexibly specified. To switch an interface from standard Ethernet mode to flexible Ethernet mode, run the flexe enable port command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter flexe enable port port-position command is run, the physical interface with this command configuration is deleted, and the services configured on the interface are also deleted. If the physical interface is an Eth-Trunk member interface, the physical interface is deleted from the Eth-Trunk after this command is run on the physical interface.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nEth-Trunk interfaces cannot be switched to the flexible Ethernet mode."
