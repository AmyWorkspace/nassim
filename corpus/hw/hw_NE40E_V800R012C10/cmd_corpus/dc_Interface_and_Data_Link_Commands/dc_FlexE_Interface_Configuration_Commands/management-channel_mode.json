    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo ensure normal communication between the interconnected devices, configure the same management channel mode for the physical interfaces in FlexE mode on the two devices.- Union mode: Management overhead packets occupy overhead blocks 4, 5, 7, and 8 in OH frames.- Section mode: Management overhead packets occupy overhead blocks 4 and 5 in OH frames.- Shim-to-shim mode: Management overhead packets occupy overhead blocks 7 and 8 in OH frames.- Shim-to-shim-option2: Management overhead packets occupy overhead blocks 6, 7, and 8 in OH frames.\nPrecautions\nAfter clock synchronization enable is onfiguraed on a FlexE physical interface, the management-channel mode shim-to-shim-op2 commnad can not be configuraed."
