    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFrequent generation of alarms will cause the physical status of interfaces to switch between Up and Down. You can use the transmission-alarm down command to customize the alarms that cause the status change. In this manner, IP devices can ignore the alarms that are not customized to suppress network flapping.\nPrecautions\nBy default, the LAIS, LOF, and LOS alarms can change the interface status. If these types of alarms are disabled, service data cannot be forwarded correctly.Because subcards on hardware support different types of alarms, not all interfaces support the preceding alarms. If the alarm type that the hardware does not support is configured, the configuration fails. The system will display a message telling you which alarm types are not supported on this interface.After the transmission-alarm down command is run, only the alarms specified currently can cause the physical status of interfaces to go Down, and the previous configuration performed by using this command is deleted. After the undo transmission-alarm down command is run, the alarms specified currently do not cause the status of interfaces to go Down.If no parameter is specified for the undo transmission-alarm down command, the default configuration is restored after the command is executed.WLNK alarms can be viewed only and cannot be configured by using this command. The WLNK alarms are always enabled and can cause the physical status of interfaces to go Down. You can run the display transmission-alarm command to view the status and statistics on the alarms."
