    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an interface is connected to a transmission device and the network is unstable, a large number of burr alarms are generated when the interface frequently alternates between up and down. If you want to ignore these alarms within a certain period, run the transmission-alarm holdoff-timer command to set an interval for filtering transmission alarms. After this command is run, the interface delays going up/down accordingly.\nPrerequisites\nTransmission alarm customization has been enabled on an interface.\nPrecautions\nThe value of the holdoff-time parameter varies with the flapping frequency of interfaces."
