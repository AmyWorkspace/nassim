    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe frequent generation of alarms causes the interface status to continuously alternate between Up and Down at the physical layer. To enable the interface to ignore alarms and clear alarms within a specified interval, run the transmission-alarm holdoff-timer command to set an interval for filtering alarm-clear messages.\nPrerequisites\nThe alarm customization function has been enabled on an interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nConfiguration of this command in the AP view of a master device takes effect globally on the following types of interfaces: E1 interface, CPOS interface, WDM interface, and 10GE WAN interface.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nSpecify the holdoff-time parameter based on the flapping frequency of an interface.\nIf this command is run in the AP view and the non-default configuration of this command exists in the interface view, the configuration on the interface takes effect. If the configuration in the interface view is the default configuration, the configuration in the AP view takes effect."
