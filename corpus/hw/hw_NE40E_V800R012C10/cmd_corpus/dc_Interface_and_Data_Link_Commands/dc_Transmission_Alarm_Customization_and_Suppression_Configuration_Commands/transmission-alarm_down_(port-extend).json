    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFrequent generation of alarms will cause the physical status of interfaces to switch between Up and Down. You can use the transmission-alarm down command to customize the alarms that cause the status change. In this manner, IP devices can ignore the alarms that are not customized to suppress network flapping.\nPrecautions\nBy default, the LAIS, LOF, and LOS alarms can change the interface status. If these types of alarms are disabled, service data cannot be forwarded correctly.After the transmission-alarm down command is run, a 10GE WAN interface in the virtual access AP-ID view goes Down only when the specified alarm is generated, and the previous configuration performed through this command is deleted.After the undo transmission-alarm down command is run, the specific alarm generated does not cause a 10GE WAN interface in the virtual access AP-ID view globally to go Down.When alarms are customized globally in the AP view, if the non-default customization is configured on the interface, the customizaiton configured on the interface takes effect. If the default customization is configured on the interface, the global configuration takes effect.WLNK alarms can be viewed only and cannot be configured by using this command. The WLNK alarms are always enabled and can cause the physical status of interfaces to go Down. You can run the display transmission-alarm command to view the status and statistics on the alarms."
