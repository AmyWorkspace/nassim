    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an upper threshold, lower threshold, and detection interval for the TX-pause error alarm, run the trap-threshold tx-pause command. After this configuration is performed, a device generates an alarm and sends it to an NMS only when the number of error packets sent or received by the device exceeds the upper threshold for three consecutive detection intervals. The device sends a clear alarm to the NMS only when the number of error packets sent or received by the device falls below the lower threshold for three consecutive detection intervals.\nPrecautions\nTo allow the configured thresholds to take effect, run the snmp-agent trap enable port command first to enable the tx-pause alarm function.\nThe high-threshold must be greater than or equal to low-threshold."
