    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the shutdown command is run, the interface operating state changes to Down. If the interface is in the disabled state, run the undo shutdown command on the interface so that configurations on the interface can take effect, after the undo shutdown command is run, the interface operating state is synchronized with the link status.\nConfiguration Impact\nServices on the interface are intermittently interrupted after the shutdown command is run on the interface.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nWhen a physical interface of a device is idle, that is, the interface is not connected to any cable, run the shutdown command to disable the interface to prevent interference.Run the shutdown and undo shutdown commands with caution. The commands are useful in some special cases, for example, an interface needs to be restarted to validate the newly configured parameters.Some logical interfaces, such as logic-channel, virtual-template, loopback, null, and dialer interfaces, do not support the shutdown or undo shutdown command."
