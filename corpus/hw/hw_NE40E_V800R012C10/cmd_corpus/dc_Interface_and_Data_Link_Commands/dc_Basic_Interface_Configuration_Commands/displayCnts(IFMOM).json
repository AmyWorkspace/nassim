The command output helps you locate and rectify a fault.\nIf you want to check traffic statistics about an interface within a specified period, run the reset counters interface command to delete existing statistics on the interface. Then, you can re-collect traffic statistics about the interface.\nTo view incoming or outgoing traffic rates on an interface, run the display counters rate command with an interface type or slot ID specified. The command output helps you locate and rectify a fault.\nIf you want to check traffic rates on an interface within a specified period, run the reset counters interface command to delete existing statistics on the interface. Then, you can recalculate traffic rates on the interface.\nPrecautions\nIf a large number of interfaces exist on the device, specify an interface number or a slot ID in the display counters command to view traffic statistics on a specified interface. Otherwise, excessive output information may cause the following problems:\nThe output information is repeatedly refreshed, and then required information cannot be obtained.The system does not respond because of long-time information traversing and searching."
