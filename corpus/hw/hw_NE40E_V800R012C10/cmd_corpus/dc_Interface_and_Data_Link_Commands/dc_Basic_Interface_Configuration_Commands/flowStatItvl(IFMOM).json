    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe interval configured in the system view for collecting traffic statistics takes effect on all the interfaces using the default traffic statistics interval.\nPrecautions\nThe interval configured in the interface view has a higher priority than that configured in the system view.\nA newly configured interval takes effect only after an existing interval expires and traffic statistics are updated during the second interval after the new interval takes effect.Management network interfaces do not support the configuration of an interval at which interface statistics are collected."
