    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nAfter a device is enabled to send IP statistics on a physical interface, the interface collects IPv4 and IPv6 traffic statistics separately and sends them to the NMS.\n\nImplementation Procedure\n\nEnable IP statistics on a physical interface.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter a device is enabled to send IP statistics on a physical interface, the device applies statistics resources for the interface.\nAfter a device is disabled from sending IP statistics on a physical interface, the device releases statistics resources on the interface.\n\nPrecautions\n\nAfter running the statistic enable command, you have to run the statistic mode forward command to allow the dual-stack traffic statistics collection function to take effect."
