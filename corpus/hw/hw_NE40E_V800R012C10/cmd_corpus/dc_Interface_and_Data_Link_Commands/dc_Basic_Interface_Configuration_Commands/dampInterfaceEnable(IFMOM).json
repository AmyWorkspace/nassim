    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIntermittent disconnections of optical fibers connecting to physical interfaces cause these interfaces' status to alternate frequently between Up and Down. To enable suppression on these interfaces' physical status flappings, run the damp-interface enable command. The link-layer and network-layer stability is then improved. After the damp-interface enable command is run, the suppression level for interface status flappings is light by default. You can run the damp-interface level command to configure a desired suppression level. When suppression on interface status flappings is disabled, the suppression level is unconfigurable.\nIf an interface's physical status flappings are suppressed, the interface's link-layer and network-layer protocols consider the interface physically Down.\nPrecautions\nYou can query whether an interface enters or exits the suppression state through the hwIfDampSuppress and hwIfDampResume alarms, respectively."
