    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe coding type of 100GE optical interfaces is DQPSK. The DQPSK encoding/decoding modes of two 100GE optical interfaces must be match so that the two interfaces can interconnect with each other. If 100GE optical interfaces fail to interconnect with each other for the first time, adjust the DQPSK modes of the interfaces. This command is supported on a device only when the device has 100 Gbit/s DWDM optical modules installed."
