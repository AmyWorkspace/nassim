    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn port extension scenarios, to set the interval at which traffic statistics are collected on an interface, run the set flow-stat interval command in the port extension interface view on a master. The configuration is then delivered to the AP and takes effect on the AP's external communication interface mapped to the port extension interface. Similarly, run the set flow-stat interval command in the port extension trunk interface view to set an interval for collecting traffic statistics on an interface. The configuration is delivered to the AP and takes effect on the AP's external communication interfaces mapped to the port extension trunk member interfaces.\nPrerequisites\nBefore running this command, run the role master command in the extended view of the port extension interface to set the current device as the master device.\nPrecautions\nA newly configured interval takes effect only after an existing interval expires and traffic statistics are updated during the second interval after the new interval takes effect.\nManagement network interfaces do not support the configuration of an interval at which interface statistics are collected.\nThe interval configured in the port extension interface view takes precedence over that configured in the AP view."
