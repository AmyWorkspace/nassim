    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set a threshold and detection interval for the CRC error alarm, run the trap-threshold crc-error command. After this configuration is performed, a device generates an alarm and sends it to an NMS only when the number of CRC error frames sent or received by the device reaches the specified threshold for three consecutive detection intervals. The device sends a clear alarm to the NMS only when the number of CRC error frames sent or received by the device falls below the threshold for three consecutive detection intervals.\nIf an interface receives a large number of CRC error frames, the interface is prone to flapping. Such interface flapping may easily be left unnoticed. To address this issue, specify shutdown in the command so that the interface is shut down at the physical level if the number of CRC error frames received within the specified interval reaches the configured alarm threshold.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf shutdown is specified in the command and the interface is deactivated because the number of CRC error frames received within the specified interval reaches the configured alarm threshold, the interface remains Down even if a clear alarm is generated. To prevent services from being affected, activate the interface manually after a clear alarm is generated.\nPrecautions\nThe configured threshold takes effect only when the CRC alarm function is enabled.\nThe following commands cannot coexist. The most recently run command overwrites the previous one.\ntrap-threshold crc-errortrap-threshold crc-error bit-error-ratiotrap-threshold crc-error high-thresholdtrap-threshold crc-error { mac-fcs-exc | mac-fcs-sd }trap-threshold crc-error percenttrap-threshold crc-error packet-error-ratio"
