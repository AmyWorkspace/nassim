    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore collecting traffic statistics on a specific interface within a specific period of time, delete the existing traffic statistics on this interface.\nFor details on how to view the interface traffic statistics on the NMS, see the NMS documentation.\nPrecautions\nInterface traffic statistics on the NMS are deleted and cannot be restored after you run the reset counters if-mib interface command. Therefore, confirm the action before you use the command.\nRunning the reset counters if-mib interface command does not affect the interface traffic statistics displayed using the display interface command.\nThis command can clear statistics on a GMPLS-UNI tunnel interface only after statistics of all interfaces on the device are cleared or statistics of the physical outbound interface of the GMPLS-UNI tunnel are cleared."
