    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an interface's physical status flappings are suppressed, you can run the damp-interface mode tx-off command to disable the interface from sending signals, so that the remote interface can detect that the local interface is unavailable.\nPrerequisites\nSuppression on the interface' physical status flappings has been enabled using the damp-interface enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the local interface is disabled from sending signals, the remote interface considers it Down.\nIf suppression on the local interface's physical status flappings is canceled, this interface automatically begins to send signals to the remote interface. The remote interface then considers this interface Up."
