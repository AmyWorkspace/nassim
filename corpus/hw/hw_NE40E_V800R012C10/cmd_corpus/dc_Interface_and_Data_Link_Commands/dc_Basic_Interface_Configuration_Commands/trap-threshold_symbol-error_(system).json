    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an upper threshold, lower threshold, detection interval for the Symbol error alarm, run the trap-threshold symbol-error high-threshold low-threshold command. After this configuration is performed, a device generates an alarm and sends it to an NMS only when the number of Symbol error frames sent or received by the device reaches the upper threshold for three consecutive detection intervals. The device sends a clear alarm to the NMS only when the number of Symbol error frames sent or received by the device falls below the lower threshold for three consecutive detection intervals.\nPrecautions\nThe configured thresholds take effect only when the Symbol alarm function is enabled. You can run the snmp-agent trap enable port symbol-error command to enable the Symbol alarm function on an interface.\nThe value of high-threshold must be greater than or equal to that of low-threshold.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
