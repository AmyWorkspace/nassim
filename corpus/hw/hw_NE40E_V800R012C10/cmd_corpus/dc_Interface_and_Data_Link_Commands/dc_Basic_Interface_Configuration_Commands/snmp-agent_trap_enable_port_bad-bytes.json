    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an interface receives a large number of bytes of error packets, the link is in a poor condition, affecting service transmission. In this situation, you can run the snmp-agent trap enable port bad-bytes command to configure the alarm function and run the trap-threshold bad-bytes command in the interface view to configure an alarm threshold and detection interval on an interface. The system then detects the number of bytes of error packets that the interface receives at the configured interval. If the number of bytes of error packets exceeds the configured alarm threshold, the system generates an alarm and sends it to the NMS, prompting the administrator to perform maintenance on the interface and troubleshoot the fault. When the number of bytes of error packets falls below the alarm threshold, the system generates a clear alarm and sends it to the NMS, notifying the administrator that the alarm has been cleared.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the snmp-agent trap disable port bad-bytes command is run, the device does not report alarm information to the NMS.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the trap-threshold bad-bytes command in the interface view to configure an alarm threshold and detection interval on an interface.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
