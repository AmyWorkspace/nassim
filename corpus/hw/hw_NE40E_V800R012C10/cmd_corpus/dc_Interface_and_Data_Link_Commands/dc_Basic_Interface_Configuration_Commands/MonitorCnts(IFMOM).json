    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo view real-time traffic statistics on an interface, run the monitor counters interface command to enable a device to monitor traffic statistics on the interface at a specified interval and display the statistics in real time. The traffic statistics include the number of unicast, multicast, and broadcast packets sent or received by the interface and the packet transmission rate.\nBy default, once this command is run, the system displays real-time traffic statistics at an interval of 10s for five times. To stop the statistics display, press Ctrl+C.\nPrerequisites\nTo monitor traffic statistics and the traffic rate on an interface, ensure that traffic statistics collection has been enabled on the interface using the statistic enable mode port command. By default, this function is disabled.To monitor traffic statistics and the traffic rate on a sub-interface, ensure that traffic statistics collection has been enabled on the sub-interface using the statistic enable command. By default, this function is disabled."
