    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an upper threshold, lower threshold, detection interval for the input or output error alarm, run the trap-threshold command. After this configuration is performed, a device generates an alarm and sends it to an NMS only when the number of input or output error frames reaches the upper threshold for three consecutive detection intervals. The device sends a clear alarm to the NMS only when the number of input or output error frames falls below the lower threshold for three consecutive detection intervals.\nPrecautions\nThe configured thresholds take effect only when the output alarm function is enabled. You can run the snmp-agent trap enable port output-error command to enable the output alarm function on an interface.\nThe value of high-threshold must be greater than or equal to that of low-threshold."
