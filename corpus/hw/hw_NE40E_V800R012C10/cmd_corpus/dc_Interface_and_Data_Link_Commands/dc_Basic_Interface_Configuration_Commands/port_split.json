    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo switch the working mode of an interface, run the port split command.\nAfter this command is executed, a single port is switched to multiple ports or a single port. The port after switching is the same as that of a common port. For example: 100GE1/0/0 is changed to 25GE1/0/0:0, 25GE1/0/0:1, 25GE1/0/0:2, and 25GE1/0/0:3.\nConfiguration Impact\nSwitch the port type or working mode on the device. The following scenarios are involved:\nThe hash function is implemented. When a single port is switched to multiple ports or a single port, port reestablishment is deleted and all configurations on the port are lost.After the bandwidth sharing function is enabled and multiple ports are switched to multiple ports, some ports are deleted and re-created, and all configurations on the deleted ports are lost.\n\nPrecautions\nAfter this command is executed, a single port is switched to multiple ports or a single port, port reestablishment is deleted and all configurations on the port are lost.\nThe port split command cannot be run on a FlexE interface."
