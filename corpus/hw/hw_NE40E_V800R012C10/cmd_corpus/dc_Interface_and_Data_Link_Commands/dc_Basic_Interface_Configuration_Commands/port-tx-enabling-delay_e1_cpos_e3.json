    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou need to consider services that have been configured on the device when configuring a signal sending delay.\nOnly physical interfaces can be configured with signal sending delays. Logical interfaces do not support this function.\nConfiguring a signal sending delay does not affect an interface that has sent signals to the peer, and the configuration takes effect after the interface is initialized."
