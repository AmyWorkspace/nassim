    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nGenerally, the IP layer controls the maximum length of frames that are sent each time. Any time the IP layer receives an IP packet to be sent, it checks to which local interface the packet is to be sent and queries the MTU of the interface. Then, the IP layer compares the MTU with the packet length to be sent. If the packet length is greater than the MTU, the IP layer fragments the packet to ensure that the length of each fragment is smaller or equal to the MTU.\nIf forcible unfragmentation is configured, certain packets are lost during data transmission at the IP layer. To ensure jumbo packets are not dropped during transmission, you need to configure forcible fragmentation. In this case, you can run the mtu command to set the size of a fragment.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the MTU is set too small and the size of packets is large, packets are broken into a great number of fragments, and may be discarded by QoS queues.\nPrecautions\nThe MTU configured on the sub-interface does not take effect on the main interface."
