If the MAC-layer bit error rate falls below a specified alarm clearing threshold, the system sends a clear alarm to the NMS.To meet users' requirements on link quality, run the trap-threshold crc-error mac-fcs-exc command to enable a device to report MAC-layer bit error rate threshold-crossing alarms and configure alarm generation and clearing thresholds.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe trap-threshold crc-error mac-fcs-sd command has been run.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the MAC-layer bit error rate reaches a specified alarm generation threshold, the system sends an alarm to the NMS.
