    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn network slicing scenarios, to enable channelization on a sub-interface of an Ethernet physical interface, run the mode channel enable command. This configuration creates a channelized sub-interface and implements independent HQoS rate limiting.\nPrerequisites\nThe encapsulation mode of a sub-interface has been set to dot1q using the vlan-type dot1q vlan-id command.\nTo activate the license for a channelized sub-interface, run the active port-mode-channel command.\nThere is no need to activate the license for a channelized sub-interface on a GE interface.\nPrecautions\nChannelization of a sub-interface is mutually exclusive with a BRAS service.\nChannelization of a sub-interface is mutually exclusive with MPLS TE tunnel traffic policing.\nChannelization of a sub-interface is mutually exclusive with VPN QoS tunnel traffic policing.\nChannelization of a sub-interface is mutually exclusive with PIM SIM service."
