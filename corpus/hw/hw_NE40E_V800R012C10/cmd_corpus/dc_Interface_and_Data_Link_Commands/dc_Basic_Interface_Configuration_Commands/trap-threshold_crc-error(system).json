    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an upper threshold, lower threshold, detection interval for the CRC error alarm, run the trap-threshold crc-error high-threshold low-threshold command. After this configuration is performed, a device generates an alarm and sends it to an NMS only when the number of CRC error frames sent or received by the device reaches the upper threshold for three consecutive detection intervals. The device sends a clear alarm to the NMS only when the number of CRC error frames sent or received by the device falls below the lower threshold for three consecutive detection intervals.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe configured thresholds take effect only when the CRC alarm function is enabled. You can run the snmp-agent trap enable port crcexc-error command to enable the CRC alarm function on an interface.\nThe value of high-threshold must be greater than or equal to that of low-threshold.\nThe following commands cannot coexist. The most recently run command overwrites the previous one.\ntrap-threshold crc-errortrap-threshold crc-error bit-error-ratiotrap-threshold crc-error high-thresholdtrap-threshold crc-error { mac-fcs-exc | mac-fcs-sd }trap-threshold crc-error percenttrap-threshold crc-error packet-error-ratio"
