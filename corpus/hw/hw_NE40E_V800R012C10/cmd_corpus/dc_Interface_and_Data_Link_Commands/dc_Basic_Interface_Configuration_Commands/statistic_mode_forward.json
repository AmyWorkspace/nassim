    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a device's all interfaces to collect traffic statistics based on IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding, run the statistic mode forward command. The supported interfaces include main physical interfaces and logical interfaces.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter statistics collection in forward mode is configured on a device, statistics about IPv4 unicast and IPv6 unicast packets are displayed in the output of the command that displays interface statistics.\nPrecautions\nAfter a member interface is removed from an Eth-Trunk interface, the statistic mode forward command in the system view does not take effect on the removed interface.During configuration restoration, the statistic mode forward command in the system view does not take effect on interfaces that are newly added on a device.When a large number of interfaces are used for IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack statistics collection, the statistic mode forward command in the system view may cause a high CPU usage.The global configuration of the command also takes effect on the physical interfaces, sub-interfaces (including physical sub-interfaces and Eth-Trunk sub-interfaces) and Eth-Trunk interfaces on newly inserted boards."
