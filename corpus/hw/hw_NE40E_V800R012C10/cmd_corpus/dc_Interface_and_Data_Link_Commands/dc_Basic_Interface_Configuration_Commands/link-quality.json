    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA bit error refers to the deviation between a bit that is sent and the bit that is received. Bit errors caused by optical fiber aging or optical signal jitter are inevitable on carrier networks. During data transmission, a high BER will degrade or even interrupt services in extreme cases.\nIn a bit-error-triggered LDP LSP switching scenario, bit error detection is enabled on interfaces along the primary and secondary links of the LDP LSP and the switching type of each interface is set to trigger-section. If the BER detected by an interface reaches or exceeds the bit error alarm reporting threshold, the status of the interface changes to Down. If the primary and secondary links of the LDP LSP both have Down interfaces, traffic transmitted over the LDP LSP is interrupted. To prevent this problem, run the link-quality set the upper and lower thresholds used by an interface to determine link quality. Then, if the BER detected by an OSPF or IS-IS interface reaches or exceeds the set upper threshold, the OSPF or IS-IS interface changes its link quality to low and increases the link cost, so that this link, which has a higher BER, is not used by the optimal route. As a result, the LDP LSP always uses the link with a lower BER to transmit traffic, minimizing the impact of bit errors on services.\nPrerequisites\nBefore running the link-quality command, run the interface interface-type interface-number command to enter the specified physical interface view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the link-quality command is configured:\nIf the BER detected by an interface reaches or exceeds the set upper threshold, the link quality changes from good to low. If the BER detected by an interface reaches or falls below the set lower threshold, the link quality changes from low to good.If the BER detected by an IS-IS or OSPF interface reaches or exceeds the set upper threshold, the interface increases the link cost, so that this link is not used by the optimal route.\n\nPrecautions\nWhen the link-quality command is run to configure the bit error detection function, ensure that the adjacent nodes on one LDP LSP must be configured with the same bit error detection mode and bit error rate threshold. Otherwise, the upstream and downstream traffic rates are different."
