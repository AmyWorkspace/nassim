    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nYou can create a route monitoring group and add routes to it. If the route monitoring group is required to trigger the status of a user-side interface to change, run the track route-monitor-group command to associate the interface with the route monitoring group. When the fault weight of the route monitoring group reaches the value specified by downWeight, the interface goes Down. This event triggers traffic to be switched to the secondary link. When the fault weight of the route monitoring group falls below the value specified by downWeight, the interface goes Up. This event triggers traffic to be switched to the primary link. This process enables the interface to promptly detect route faults on the network side, ensuring service reliability on the user side.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA route monitoring group has been created using the ip route-monitor-group command.\n\nPrecautions\n\n\nEach interface can be associated with only one route monitoring group.\nRoutes&middot;in&middot;a&middot;route&middot;monitoring&middot;group&middot;cannot&middot;be&middot;those&middot;generated&middot;by&middot;the&middot;IP&middot;address&middot;of&middot;an&middot;interface&middot;that&middot;has&middot;been&middot;associated&middot;with&middot;the&middot;route&middot;monitoring&middot;group.\nIf trigger-down-weight is not specified when an interface is associated with a route monitoring group, the interface goes down only if all the routes in the monitoring group are unavailable."
