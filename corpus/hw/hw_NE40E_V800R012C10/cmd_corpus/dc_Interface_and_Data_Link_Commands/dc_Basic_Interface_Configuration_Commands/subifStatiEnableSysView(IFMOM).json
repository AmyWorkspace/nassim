    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the traffic statistics collection function is disabled on Ethernet sub-interfaces. Before checking statistics about sent or received packets on an Ethernet sub-interface, run the statistic enable command in the Ethernet sub-interface view to enable the traffic statistics collection function.\nPrerequisites\nAn Ethernet interface has been specified and sub-interfaces have been configured for the Ethernet interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the subinterface traffic-statistics enable command is run in the system view, the traffic statistics collection function is enabled on all sub-interface of the device.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the rate statistics collection function is enabled on all the sub-interfaces of an Ethernet interface on a device, the device periodically refreshes rate statistics on the sub-interfaces. The display interface command can be used to view rate statistics.\nPrecautions\nEnabling the traffic statistics collection function may consume a lot of system resources. Exercise caution when using the subinterface traffic-statistics enable command.\nRunning the undo subinterface traffic-statistics enable command in the system view disables traffic statistics collection on all sub-interfaces, whereas running the undo subinterface traffic-statistics enable command in the interface view disables traffic statistics collection of only the sub-interfaces on the interface.\nThis command does not take effect on EVC sub-interfaces."
