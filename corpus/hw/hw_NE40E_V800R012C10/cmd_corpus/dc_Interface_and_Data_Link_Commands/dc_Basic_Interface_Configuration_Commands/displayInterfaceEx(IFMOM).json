    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore you monitor the status of an interface or locate an interface fault, use the display interface command to collect the running status of and statistics on the interface. You can troubleshoot the interface based on the command output.\nPerform any of following operations based on the interface status and statistics:\nIf the interface is Down, check whether the link connection is correct or whether interface negotiation succeeds.Interface statistics reflect traffic received and sent. If the interface has a lot of error statistics, check whether the interface is attacked or whether the link quality is stable.If the date and time when the interface last went Up and Down are different from those in the actual situation, contact technical support personnel\nCompared with the display interface brief command, the display interface command provides more interface information to help locate faults.\n\nPrecautions\nPhysical status and link layer protocol status of an interface: Commonly, the link layer protocol status of a working interface is Up.\nLast 300 seconds input rate and last 300 seconds output rate of an interface: The existing traffic on the interface needs to be compared with the interface bandwidth. If the existing traffic exceeds 80% of the interface bandwidth, such a situation must be recorded and confirmed. In addition, check whether error statistics about incoming and outgoing traffic are collected on an interface and take actions if statistics about error packets increase.\nTo view statistics about IPv4 or IPv6 traffic in the inbound and outbound directions on an interface, enable statistics collection in both directions on the interface."
