    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command can be used to shut down the associated physical port when an alarm of a certain type is reported to the NMS. The type of the alarm can be a CRC, SDH, input, output, symbol alarm.\nYou can run the port-alarm clear command to clear the alarms generated on a port and restore the port.\nPrecautions\nThis command takes effect only when the corresponding alarm function is enabled. You can run the snmp-agent trap enable port command to enable the function to generate alarms for CRC, SDH, input, output, symbol errors on an interface.\nBIP8 SD alarms are applicable to 40GE/50GE/100GE interfaces only."
