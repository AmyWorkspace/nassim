    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable CRC error threshold crossing detection and set an alarm threshold for the CRC error percentage, run the trap-threshold crc-error percent command. When the percentage of CRC error frames to the total number of packets reaches the specified threshold, the device generates an alarm and sends it to an NMS. When the percentage of CRC error frames to the total number of packets falls below the specified threshold, the device generates a clear alarm and sends it to the NMS.\nAlarm threshold in percentages = Number of CRC error frames received by an interface within 1 second/Total number of packets received by an interface within 1 second\nPrecautions\nThe configured alarm threshold takes effect only when the alarm function is enabled for CRC errors. You can run the snmp-agent trap enable port crcexc-error command to enable the alarm function for CRC errors on an interface.\nThe following commands cannot coexist.
