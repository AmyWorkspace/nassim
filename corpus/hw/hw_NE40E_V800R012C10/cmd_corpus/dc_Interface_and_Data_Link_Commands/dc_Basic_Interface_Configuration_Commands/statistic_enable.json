    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a device is enabled to send IP statistics on a physical interface, the interface collects IPv4 and IPv6 traffic statistics separately and sends them to the NMS.\nImplementation Procedure\nEnable IP statistics on a physical interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter a device is enabled to send IP statistics on a physical interface, the device applies statistics resources for the interface.\nAfter a device is disabled from sending IP statistics on a physical interface, the device releases statistics resources on the interface.\nPrecautions\nAfter running the statistic enable (main interface view) command, you have to run the statistic mode forward command to allow the dual-stack traffic statistics collection function to take effect."
