    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nInterface bandwidth is classified as physical bandwidth or configuration bandwidth. The bandwidth command sets configuration bandwidth for an interface, which does not affect the physical bandwidth of the interface. To view the command configurations, you can check the ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed objects in the IF-MIB on the NMS.\nIf the configured bandwidth is smaller than 4000 Mbit/s, ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed are respectively displayed as bandwidthx1000x1000 and bandwidth.If the configured bandwidth is equal to or larger than 4000 Mbit/s, ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed are respectively displayed as 4294967295 (0XFFFFFFFF) and bandwidth.\n\nPrecautions\nA main interface's bandwidth determines the default sub-interface bandwidth.\nIf the bandwidth command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
