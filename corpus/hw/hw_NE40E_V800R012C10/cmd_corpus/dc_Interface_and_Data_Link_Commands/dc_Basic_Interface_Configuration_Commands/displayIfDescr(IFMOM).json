    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFor simplifying interface management, run the description command to record the use of each interface. In the case of many interfaces, run the display interface description command to view the description of these interfaces.\nIf the interface is Down, check whether the link connection is correct or whether interface negotiation succeeds.\nPrecautions\nAll the activated interfaces are described in accordance with a standard. The standards defined by customers are recommended.\nIf no customer standard is defined, the interfaces are described in the form of name of the local device-interface number of the local device->name of the peer device-interface number of the peer device//interface rate.\nIf you find that the description of interfaces does not comply with the standard using the display interface description command, run the description command to standardize description of the interfaces."
