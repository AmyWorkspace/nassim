    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe formula for calculating interface OSPF cost is as follows: OSPF cost = Reference bandwidth/Interface bandwidth. To specify the type of interface bandwidth, run the interface-bandwidth-type command. Specify physical if you want to use physical-layer bandwidth and data-link if you want to use data-link-layer bandwidth. By default, an interface uses data-link-layer bandwidth for OSPF cost calculation.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
