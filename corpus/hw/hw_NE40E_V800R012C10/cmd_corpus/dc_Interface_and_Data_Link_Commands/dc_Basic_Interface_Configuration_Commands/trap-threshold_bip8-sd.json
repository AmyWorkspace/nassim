    ],
    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the number of BIP8 SD errors occurring within a certain period exceeds the alarm threshold, the system generates an alarm and sends it to the NMS. When the number of BIP8 SD errors occurring within the period falls below an alarm clearance threshold, the system sends a message about alarm clearance to the NMS. The alarm clearance threshold is a magnitude lower than the alarm threshold for BIP8 SD errors. You can run the snmp-agent trap enable port command to enable the bip8-sd alarm function on an interface.\nPrecautions\nThe bip8-sd alarm function applies only to the 40GE/50GE/100GE interface."
