    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a network fault is rectified and a binding interface goes Up, a period of time is required for route establishment and entry generation. During this time, the binding interface is Up but cannot forward services. Therefore, if the track interface goes Up immediately after the binding interface goes Up, packet loss occurs. To resolve this problem, run the trigger-up-delay command to set the delay time after which a track interface goes Up.\nPrerequisites\nAn interface monitoring group has been created using the monitor-group command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the trigger-up-delay command is run and the problem binding interface recovers, the track interface does not go Up immediately but goes Up after the delayValue time expires."
