    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a BD scenario, the Router has two sub-interfaces configured in a main interface, one with the Dot1q encapsulation type and the other with the default encapsulation type. Once the sub-interface encapsulated Dot1q receives traffic, the sub-interface with the default encapsulation type also sends out the traffic. This may cause the illusion of return current. Besides, the Router has two interfaces configured on a BD scenario. The first interface has a sub-interface that is configured with the Dot1q encapsulation type. The second interface has two sub-interfaces that are configured with the Dot1q and default encapsulation types respectively. Once traffic passes through the sub-interface on the first interface, the second interface also sends two copied traffic from each of its sub-interfaces. This causes traffic to be replicated, wasting resources and reducing the board's forwarding efficiency. To allow traffic to be sent through specific interfaces, enable strict filter.\nRun the command ethernet egress-strict-filter enable to enable the global strict filter function. The traffic that was previously forwarded through multiple interfaces is only forwarded through the EVC sub-interfaces with the Dot1q encapsulation type."
