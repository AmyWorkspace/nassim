    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore collecting traffic statistics on a specific interface within a specific period of time, delete existing traffic statistics on this interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf penalty is specified in the command, the penalty of control-flap on an interface is deleted; if counter is specified in the command, the number of times interface flapping occurs are deleted.\nPrecautions\nAfter the reset control-flap command is run, statistics about control-flap on an interface are reset to 0 using the display control-flap command. Therefore, confirm the action before you run the reset control-flap command."
