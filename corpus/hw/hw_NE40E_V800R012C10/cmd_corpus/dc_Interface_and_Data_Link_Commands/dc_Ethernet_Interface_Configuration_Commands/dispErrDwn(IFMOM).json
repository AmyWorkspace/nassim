    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe auto recovery function is configured and the delay for the transition from Down to Up is set on an interface using the error-down auto-recovery command. If the interface is now in the error-down state, run the display error-down recovery command to view the remaining time for an Up event.\nAn interface enters the error-down state after being shut down due to an error.\nPrerequisites\nThe auto recovery function has been configured on an interface using the error-down auto-recovery command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf interface is not configured in this command, the system displays information about all interfaces in the error-down state."
