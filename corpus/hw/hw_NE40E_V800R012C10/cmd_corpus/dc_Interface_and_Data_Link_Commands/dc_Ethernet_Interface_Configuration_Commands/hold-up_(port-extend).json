    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFor a port extension interface, when a generalflow test is performed in Layer 2 Ethernet forwarding, IP forwarding, L2VPN (VLL/VPLS), or L3VPN scenarios, run the hold-up command to enable the interface to stay in the delayed Up state, so that the generalflow test can be properly performed.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe interface status does not change with alarm functions. The interface remains delayed Up even if the interface is not connected to cables, and the link indicator is always on.\nPrecautions\nThe hold-up command can be run only on an Ethernet, or GE interface on which a generalflow test is performed. Before you run the hold-up command on a physical interface, ensure that the interface staying in the delayed Up state does not affect services."
