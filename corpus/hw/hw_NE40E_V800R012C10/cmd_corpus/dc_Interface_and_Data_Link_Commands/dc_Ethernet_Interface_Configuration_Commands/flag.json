J0 and J1 are used for interoperability between devices of different countries, regions, or manufacturers.\nConfiguration Impact\nOn a carrier's network, the J0 byte can be any character; at the border between networks managed by different carriers, the J0 bytes on the sender and receiver must be identical. J0 helps locate and rectify faults in advance and reduces the network recovery time.\nPrecautions\nC2 and J1 bytes on the sender and receiver must be identical."
