    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFor a CPOS interface, on a network where MC-LMSP 1+1 is associated with PW redundancy, dual bypass PWs must be established to protect traffic on both working and protect links for PWs. In MC-LMSP 1+1 unidirectional mode, if the working or protect interface of an MC-LMSP group goes Down, traffic cannot be forwarded along the dual bypass PWs. The hold-up command can be run on the working or protect interface of the MC-LMSP group to prevent the preceding problem.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe interface status does not change with alarm functions. The interface remains delayed Up even if the interface is not connected to cables, and the link indicator is always on.\nPrecautions\nFor CPOS interfaces, the hold-up command on the working or protect interface is recommended only for an MC-LMSP 1+1 unidirectional group."
