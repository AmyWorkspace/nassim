    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTwo connected interfaces must work in the same transmission mode for higher communication reliability. If one interface is in LAN mode and the other is in OTN mode, run the set transfer-mode-otn command on one of the interfaces so that the two interfaces have the same transmission mode.\nPrerequisites\nThe set transfer-mode command applies only to 10GE LAN (on the OTN card), 100GE LAN interfaces.\nBefore configuring a 10GE LAN, 100GE LAN interface to work in LAN transmission mode, delete all configurations but the IP address from the interface and shut down the interface.\nPrecautions\nAfter the set transfer-mode otn command is run to set the transmission mode of a LAN interface to OTN, the 10GE LAN interface does not support the carrier{ up-hold-time | down-hold-time } command.\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
