    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a local interface sends frames at the line speed and frame loss occurs on the remote end, run the ipg non-shrink command to configure the interface to send frames in non-compression mode. That means that the IPG is the standard value 12 bytes.\nPrecautions\nExcept for the CR53E8GFB, CR57EFGFE, CR57TBXF, CR57T6XF subcard, interfaces on the other subcards use the standard IPG (12 bytes) as the default IPG."
