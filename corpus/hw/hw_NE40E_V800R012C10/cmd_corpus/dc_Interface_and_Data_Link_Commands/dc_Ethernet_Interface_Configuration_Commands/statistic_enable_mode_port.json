    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nBy default, bit rate statistics collection is disabled on Ethernet interfaces. Before checking the bit rate statistics about packets received and sent by an Ethernet interface, run the statistic enable mode port command in the Ethernet interface view to enable bit rate statistics collection. The bit rate statistics of multicast, unicast, and broadcast traffic can be distinguished based on destination MAC addresses.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBit rate statistics collection has been supported on the boards where Eth-Trunk member interfaces or physical interfaces reside.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\n\nRun the display counters rate command to check the statistics."
