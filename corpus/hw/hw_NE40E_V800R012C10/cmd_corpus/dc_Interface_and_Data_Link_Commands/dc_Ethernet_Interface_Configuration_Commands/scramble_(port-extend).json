    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prevent consecutive 1s or 0s and facilitate clock signal extraction on the receiver, run the scramble command to enable the payload scrambling function on a 10GE WAN interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nDisabling the payload scrambling function may deteriorate the quality of clock signals extracted by the receiver.\nPrecautions\nThe status of the payload scrambling function (enabled or disabled) on the interface must be consistent with that on the transmission devices."
