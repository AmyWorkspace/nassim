    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe command is applicable to only the Ethernet electrical interface on the main control board.\nIn the promiscuous mode, the data frames received from the physical layers are received.\nIf the promiscuous mode is disabled, when receiving the data frames, the Ethernet MAC module filters them based on the MAC destination addresses. Only the packets with the destination address as the local host MAC or the multicast MAC or the broadcast MAC can be received."
