    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen symmetrical load balancing and symmetrical load balancing compensation are configured, to adjust the order in which trunk member interfaces are delivered, run the hash index command to configure hash indexes for the member interfaces.\nPrerequisites\nSymmetrical load balancing or symmetrical load balancing compensation has been configured using the load-balance symmetric-hash [ complement ] command.\nPrecautions\nWhen configuring symmetrical load balancing, you must note the following:\nThe values of hash-index on both devices should be consistent.The weight of the same member interfaces should be consistent to ensure that the load balancing result is consistent.When not both interfaces on the two ends are Up, the load balancing result is not consistent.The master/standby trunk cannot ensure that the load balancing result is consistent."
