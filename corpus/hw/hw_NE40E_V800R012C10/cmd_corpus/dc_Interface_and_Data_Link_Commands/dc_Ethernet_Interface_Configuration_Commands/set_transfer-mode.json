    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf transmission modes of interfaces at two ends of a link do not match (for example, one is in LAN mode and the other is in WAN mode), run the set transfer-mode command to configure one interface to work in the same transmission mode as the other to ensure reliable transmission.\nPrerequisites\nBefore setting the transmission mode of a 10GE interface to LAN or WAN, delete the clock, PTP, and loopback configurations from the interface and run the shutdown command on the interface.\nPrecautions\nThe LAN/WAN mode of an interface cannot be changed if the interface has sub-interfaces or has been added to an Eth-Trunk interface."
