The information includes the name of each permanent interface group, number of member interfaces in each permanent interface group, and names of the interfaces in each permanent interface group. The information helps view interface configurations or analyze problems.\nPrecautions\nThe display port-group command does not display information about a temporary interface group that has been created using the port-group group-member command.\nIf no parameter is specified, the display port-group command displays only the total number of permanent interface groups that have been created in the system and their names."
