    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a multicast network, forged MLD messages may be used to attack devices, causing devices unable to forward multicast traffic. To protect a device against attacks launched using forged MLD messages, run the ipsec sa command to configure the device to authenticate the sent and received MLD messages based on a specified SA.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast ipv6 routing-enable command.Basic IPsec functions have been configured.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the query ipsec sa command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one. If the query ipsec sa and ipsec sa commands are both configured, the command configured later overrides the command configured earlier.\nThe function of this command is the same as that of the mld ipsec sa command used in the interface view. The configuration in the MLD view is used only when the configuration in the interface view is not available."
