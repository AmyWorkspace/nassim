    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen users connected to different interfaces want to watch programs multicast by different multicast sources, run the group command to configure different SSM mappings for IPv6 policies of different interfaces. After that, MLD packets received by different interfaces can be mapped to different multicast sources and users' requirements can be answered."
