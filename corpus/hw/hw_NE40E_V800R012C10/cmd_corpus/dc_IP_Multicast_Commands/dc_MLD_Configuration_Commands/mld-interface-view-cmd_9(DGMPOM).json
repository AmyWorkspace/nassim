    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMLD on-demand is used on a multicast device directly connected to an access device, not user hosts. MLD on-demand reduces packet exchanges between the access device and multicast device and reduces the load of these devices.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a multicast device has MLD group records before MLD on-demand is enabled on the multicast device, the multicast device does not process these MLD group records after MLD on-demand is enabled on it.\nPrecautions\nAfter the mld on-demand command is used, the following situations occur:\nThe multicast device interface connected to the access device sends only one MLD general query message to the access device.The multicast device interface connected to the access device directly deletes the entry for a group after it receives an MLD Done message for the group."
