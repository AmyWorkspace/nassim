    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an IPv6 multicast network segment connected to users, MLD needs to be run on the device and the hosts connected to the device. After MLD is enabled on the interface that connects the device to the user network segment, the device can communicate with user hosts and process IPv6 protocol packets sent by the user hosts.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast ipv6 routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view.\nThe pim ipv6 sm command is run on the interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe other MLD parameters configured on the interface before MLD is enabled on this interface take effect only after the mld enable command is run on the interface.\nPrecautions\nIf the mld enable command is run on the interface connected to the user, PIM IPv6 also needs to be enabled. Otherwise, multicast traffic cannot be forwarded.The command fails to be run in the VLANIF interface view if VLAN aggregation is enabled in the corresponding VLAN."
