    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf multiple multicast Routers are connected to a network segment, one of the Routers is selected as the querier to periodically send Query messages to the network segment. If the non-queriers do not receive any Query message from the querier within the Keepalive period of other MLD queriers, they consider the querier invalid, and automatically trigger a new round of the querier election. After the election, the Router with the lowest IPv6 link-local address on the shared network segment acts as the querier.\nIf the Keepalive period of other MLD queriers is shorter than the interval for sending MLD general query messages, the querier election is performed frequently."
