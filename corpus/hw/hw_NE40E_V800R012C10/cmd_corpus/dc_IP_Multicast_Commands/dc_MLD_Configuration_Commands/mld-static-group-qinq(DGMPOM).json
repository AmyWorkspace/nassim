    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf user hosts want to receive IPv6 multicast data for a Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) group stably for a long time or to ensure that MLD group memberships on the user network segment are stable, run the mld static-group command to add the interface connected to user hosts to MLD groups statically. In this manner, the interface can fast respond to users' requests, thereby reducing the channel switch time.\nIf user hosts want to receive IPv6 multicast data for an MLD group from a specific multicast source for a long time, set the source ipv6-source-address parameter in the mld static-group command to specify the IPv6 multicast source address.\nThe mld static-group command is run on the interface connected to user hosts. The interface can be added to a single IPv6 multicast group or source/group, or be added to multiple IPv6 multicast groups or source/groups in batches.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast ipv6 routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the mld static-group command is run, the records about the MLD groups that the interface is added statically never time out. The router considers that this interface is always connected to IPv6 member hosts, and continues to forward qualified IPv6 multicast packets to the network segment where the interface resides.\nIf IPv6 multicast groups have been configured in batches and you modify only the value of group-number but not the value of ipv6-group-address or ipv6-group-mask-length to configure batch multicast groups again, the new batch configurations overwrite the previous batch configurations.\nFollow-up Procedure\nIf user hosts no longer want to receive IPv6 multicast data for a group, manually delete the configurations of static MLD groups from the interface connected with user hosts.\nPrecautions\nYou are allowed to configure overlapped multicast group addresses in different batch configurations.\nAfter batch static multicast groups are configured on an interface, you cannot perform the deletion operation before the system completes the batch join processing.\nThe command fails to be run in the VLANIF interface view in the following condition:\nVLAN aggregation is enabled in the corresponding VLAN."
