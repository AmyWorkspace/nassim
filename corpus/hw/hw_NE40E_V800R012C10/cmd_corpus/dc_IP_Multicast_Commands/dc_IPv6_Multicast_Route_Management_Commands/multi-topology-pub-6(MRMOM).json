    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn the current network, multicast services highly depend on unicast routes. During multicast routing, a router searches a unicast routing table for an optimal route. If the unicast optimal route, shared by both multicast services and unicast services, is faulty, the multicast services and unicast services will be interrupted and users fail to receive the multicast data.\nWith multicast multi-topologies, IPv6 multicast services can run in a specified topology, which isolates IPv6 multicast services from unicast services, and the system searches routes only in the unicast routing table, the static multicast routing table, and the Multicast Border Gateway Protocol (MBGP) routing table specified by the multicast topology.\nPrerequisites\nA global IPv6 multicast topology instance has been enabled.\nPrecautions\nMulticast topology instances support direct routes, static routes, IS-IS routes, and MBGP routes."
