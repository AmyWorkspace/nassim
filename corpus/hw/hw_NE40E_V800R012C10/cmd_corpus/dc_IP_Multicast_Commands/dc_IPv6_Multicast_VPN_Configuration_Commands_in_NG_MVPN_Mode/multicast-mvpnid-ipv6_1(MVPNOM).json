    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the IPv6 NG MVPN scenario, the IPv6 multicast traffic is carried by IPv4 tunnel in public network, the receiver PE needs to identify IPv6 multicast traffic received from IPv4 tunnels. When the receiver PEs are non-Huawei devices, the IPv6 multicast packets received from a IPv4 Tunnel should be encapsulated an IPv6 explicit-null label at the bottom of MPLS label stack. Otherwise, the non-Huawei device cannot identify the IPv6 multicast packets. Run the multicast ipv6 mvpn apply-label explicit-null command to encapsulate IPv6 explicit-null label to IPv6 multicast packets, so that the receiver PE can identify and process the IPv6 multicast packets received from IPv4 tunnels.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast ipv6 mvpn command is executed."
