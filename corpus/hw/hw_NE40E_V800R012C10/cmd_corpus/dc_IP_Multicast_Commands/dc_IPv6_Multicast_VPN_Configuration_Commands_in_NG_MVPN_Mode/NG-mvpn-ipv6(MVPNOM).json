    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn IPv6 Next Generation MVPN (NG MVPN) is a new framework designed to transmit IP multicast traffic across a BGP/MPLS IP VPN. An IPv6 NG MVPN uses BGP to transmit signaling information, and uses PIM-SM, Protocol Independent Multicast-Source-Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM), point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE, or multipoint extensions for LDP (mLDP) to transmit data. The NG MVPN enables unicast and multicast services to be delivered using the same VPN architecture.\nAll IPv6 NG MVPN configurations are performed in the VPN instance IPv6 address family MVPN view. Before deploying an IPv6 NG MVPN, run the mvpn command to enable MVPN so that configurations can be performed in the VPN instance IPv6 address family MVPN view.\nPrerequisites\nAn MVPN ID has been configured using the multicast ipv6 mvpn command. The mvpn command cannot be executed if an MVPN ID has not been configured.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo mvpn command deletes all configurations in the VPN instance IPv6 address family MVPN view. Exercise caution when running the command.\nIf MVPN has been enabled using the mvpn command, the undo multicast ipv6 mvpn command cannot be executed. Before using the undo multicast ipv6 mvpn command, run the undo mvpn command to disable MVPN of all VPN instances."
