    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an IPv6 next-generation multicast virtual private network (NG MVPN), a PE can be either a sender or receiver PE. Multicast data enters a point-to-multipoint (P2MP) tunnel from a sender PE and leaves the tunnel from a receiver PE. To configure a PE as a sender PE, run the sender-enable command. The PE connecting to the multicast source generally functions as a sender PE.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter a PE is configured as a sender PE, the PE has both the sender PE and receiver PE functionalities, meaning that the PE can send and receive multicast data through a P2MP tunnel."
