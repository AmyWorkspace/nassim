    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPMSI tunnels are the logical tunnels used by the public network to transmit VPN multicast data, and P-tunnels are the actual tunnels used by the public network to transmit VPN multicast data. A sender PE uses PMSI tunnels to send specific VPN multicast data to receiver PEs. The receiver PEs determine whether to accept the VPN multicast traffic based on PMSI tunnel information.\nI-PMSI tunnels can be established using P2MP TE or mLDP. To use P2MP TE to establish an I-PMSI tunnel, run the mpls te command.\nPrecautions\nThe mpls te command is exclusive with the mldp (IPv6 MVPN I-PMSI view) command in the same VPN instance.\nRunning the undo mpls te command deletes all configurations in the I-PMSI MPLS TE view. Exercise caution when running the command."
