    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPMSI tunnels are the logical tunnels used by the public network to transmit VPN multicast data, and P-tunnels are the actual tunnels used by the public network to transmit VPN multicast data. A sender provider edge (PE) uses PMSI tunnels to send specific VPN multicast data to receiver PEs. The receiver PEs determine whether to accept the VPN multicast traffic based on PMSI tunnel information.\nI-PMSI tunnels can be established using point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE or mLDP. To use mLDP to establish an I-PMSI tunnel, run the mldp command.\nPrecautions\nThe mldp command is exclusive with the mpls te (IPv6 MVPN I-PMSI view) command in the same VPN instance."
