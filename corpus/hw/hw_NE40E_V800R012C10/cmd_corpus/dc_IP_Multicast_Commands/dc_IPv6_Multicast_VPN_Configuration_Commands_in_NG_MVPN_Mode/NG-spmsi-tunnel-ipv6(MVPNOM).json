    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPMSI tunnels are the logical tunnels used by the public network to transmit VPN multicast data, and P-tunnels are the actual tunnels used by the public network to transmit VPN multicast data. PMSI tunnels are classified as I-PMSI or S-PMSI tunnels.\nI-PMSI:An I-PMSI tunnel connects to all the PEs on an MVPN.The multicast data sent over an I-PMSI tunnel can be received by all PEs on the MVPN. In a VPN instance, one PE corresponds only to one I-PMSI tunnel.S-PMSI:An S-PMSI tunnel connects to the sender and receiver PEs of specific multicast sources and groups. The multicast data sent over an S-PMSI tunnel is received only by PEs interested in the data. In a VPN instance, one PE can correspond to multiple S-PMSI tunnels.\nS-PMSI tunnels can be established using P2MP TE or mLDP. Before configuring switching between I-PMSI and S-PMSI tunnels, run the spmsi-tunnel command to display the MVPN S-PMSI view.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe MVPN I-PMSI view has been displayed using the ipmsi-tunnel command (if you want to run the spmsi-tunnel command), or the undo ipmsi-tunnel command has been run (if you want to run the undo spmsi-tunnel command).\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the group (IPv6 MVPN S-PMSI view) command to configure the address pool range and criteria for switching between I-PMSI and S-PMSI tunnels.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo spmsi-tunnel command deletes all configurations in the IPv6 MVPN S-PMSI view. Exercise caution when running the command."
