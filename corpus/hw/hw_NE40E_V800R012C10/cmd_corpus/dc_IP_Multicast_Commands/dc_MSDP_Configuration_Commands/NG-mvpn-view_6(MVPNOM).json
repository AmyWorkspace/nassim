    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf PIM-SM MDT setup is not across the public network, you can configure a PE or CE as a VPN instance's rendezvous point (RP). If a CE is configured as an RP, the CE needs to establish an MDSP peer relationship with its connected local PE and transmit (S, G) entry information in MSDP SA messages to the PE. To enable the local PE to transmit the (S, G) entry information to the remote PE through BGP Source Active A-D routes, run the import msdp command.\nPrecautions\nIf a PE is configured as a VPN instance's RP, you do not need to run the import msdp command."
