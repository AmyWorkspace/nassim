    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen you want to re-configure the TCP connection between MSDP peers or clear statistics about the specified MSDP peer, run the reset msdp peer command.\nUse the reset msdp statistics command to clear the statistics about an MSDP peer without resetting the MSDP peer.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter this command is run, the TCP connection with the specified MSDP peer is torn down and a new TCP is set up again. During this process, MSDP services are interrupted, which may affect multicast services, for example, multicast data transmission fails. Therefore, use this command with caution.\nPrecautions\nIf vpn-instance is not specified, the TCP connections set up between MSDP peers in the public network instance are reset and the statistics about MSDP peers in the public network instance are cleared."
