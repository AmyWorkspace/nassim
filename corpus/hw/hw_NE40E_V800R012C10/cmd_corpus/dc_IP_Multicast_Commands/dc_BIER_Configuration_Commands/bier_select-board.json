    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen BIER traffic enters a tunnel through a BFIR or exits a tunnel through a BFER, the BFIR or BFER may forward the BIER traffic to internal boards for processing. To limit the range of boards that process BIER traffic, run the bier select-board command. For example, you can limit the board range to the board where the inbound or outbound interface of the BIER traffic resides. This prevents BIER services from being affected when other boards are powered off.\nPrecautions\nThe maximum number of boards that can process BIER traffic is 20.\nWhen only one board is configured to process BIER traffic, the bier reserve-interface enhancement command does not take effect.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
