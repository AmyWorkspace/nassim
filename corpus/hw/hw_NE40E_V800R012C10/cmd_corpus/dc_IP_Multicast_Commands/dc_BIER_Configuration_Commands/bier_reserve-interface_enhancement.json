    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enhance loopback board selection in scenarios where a BIER tunnel carries multicast traffic, run the bier reserve-interface enhancement command. After the command is run on a device, the device selects both the master and slave loopback boards. In normal cases, the device forwards traffic only through the master loopback board. If this board fails, traffic is quickly switched to the slave loopback board."
