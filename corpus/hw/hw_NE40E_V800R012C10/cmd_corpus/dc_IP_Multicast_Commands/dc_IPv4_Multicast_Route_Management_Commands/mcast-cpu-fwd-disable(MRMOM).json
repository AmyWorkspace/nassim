    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn most cases, the Router forwards packets based on software before the hardware forwarding is completed. After that, the forwards packets based on hardware.\nSoft forwarding for multicast packets must be disabled on the router to prevent the low forwarding speed and first packet cache mechanism of soft forwarding from causing disorder of the first packet transmitted at a high speed.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view."
