    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the outbound interface of multicast services is a trunk interface and the physical state of a trunk member interface changes from Down to Up, before multicast forwarding entries are delivered to this member interface, packet loss may occur during multicast forwarding. By default, multicast traffic is forwarded 2 seconds after the physical state of a trunk member interface changes from Down to Up. This ensures that no packet is lost during multicast forwarding. When the multicast traffic is heavy, it takes a longer time to deliver multicast forwarding entries to member interfaces. If the default hold-up period cannot meet the requirement, you can run this command to adjust the hold-up period."
