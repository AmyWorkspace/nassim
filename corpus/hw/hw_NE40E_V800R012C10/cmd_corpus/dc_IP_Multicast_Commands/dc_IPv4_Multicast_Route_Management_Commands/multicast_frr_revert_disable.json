    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a multicast FRR scenario, a device with the default FRR configuration rapidly switches traffic on a secondary link back to a primary link when the primary one recovers. Multicast FRR switchback, however, is not recommended for ring networks, because the device fails to receive traffic from a secondary link if a switchover is performed again in a short time after a switchback. To disable multicast FRR switchback, run the multicast frr revert disable command."
