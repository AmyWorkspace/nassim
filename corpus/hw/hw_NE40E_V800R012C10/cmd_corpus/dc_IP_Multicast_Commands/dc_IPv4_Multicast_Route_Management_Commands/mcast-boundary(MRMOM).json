    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe multicast boundary command is used to configure a multicast forwarding boundary to set the forwarding range for multicast data packets.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view or the VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nTo configure multiple multicast forwarding boundaries for different multicast groups on an interface, run this command on the interface for several times.\nPrecautions\nAssume that A and B are two multicast group ranges to be configured with multicast forwarding boundaries, and B is a subset of A. If A is first configured on an interface, B cannot be configured. If B is configured on the interface first and then A is configured, the configuration of B is substituted by that of A.\nCommon tunnel interfaces do not support this command. Only the GRE Tunnel interface supports this command."
