    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a VRRP-based IGMP hot backup scenario, run the multicast track vrrp command to bind a multicast service interface to a VRRP backup group, disabling the backup devices in the group from forwarding multicast traffic. When the interface of the master device goes Down, multicast traffic can be switched to the interface of the newly selected master device rapidly."
