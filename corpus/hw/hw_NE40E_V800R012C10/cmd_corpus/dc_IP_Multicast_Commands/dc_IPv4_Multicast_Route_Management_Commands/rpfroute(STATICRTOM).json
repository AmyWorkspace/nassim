    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMulticast static routes are an important basis of the RPF check. By configuring multicast static routes, you can specify an RPF interface and an RPF neighbor for the specific source of packets on the current Router.\nMulticast static routes provide the following functions, depending on specific applicable environments:\nChanging RPF routes\nIf the topology of multicast is the same as that of unicast, the transmission path of multicast data is the same as that of unicast data. You can configure multicast static routes to change the RPF routes. Thus, a transmission path dedicated for the multicast data is established, which is different from the transmission path of unicast data.\nConnecting RPF routes\nOn the network segment where unicast routes are blocked, when multicast static routes are not configured, packets cannot be forwarded because there is no RPF route. In such a case, you can configure multicast static routes. Therefore, the system can generate RPF routes, complete the RPF check, create routing entries, and guide the forwarding of packets.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nPrecautions\nWhen configuring a multicast static route, configure the next hop interface in the command if the type of the next hop interface is P2P. If the next hop interface is not P2P, configure it in the next hop address form.\nA multicast static route configured using the ip rpf-route-static command may not take effect if the outbound interface recursion fails or the specified interface is Down. Therefore, after running this command, you are advised to run the display ip routing-table protocol static command to check whether the configuration is successful or the configured multicast static route is effective."
