    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set a multicast FRR monitoring interval, run the multicast frr monitor cycle command. A multicast FRR monitoring interval can be set to 20 ms, 40 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, or 500 ms. Maximum packet loss period = Monitoring interval x 2 + 10 ms (time for synchronization between the master and backup state machines). For example, if the monitoring interval is set to 100 ms, the packet loss period is within 210 ms.\nPrecautions\nA link switchover will be triggered if no packets are received in a detection period due to upstream traffic congestion, trunk member interface switchover, or other reasons.\nA link switchover will not be triggered if the duration of packet loss on the primary link does not exceed the detection period.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
