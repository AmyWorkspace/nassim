    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the advertisement of multicast routes through BGP, if the original next-hop outbound interface of a route to a multicast source is a TE tunnel's outbound interface on which IGP shortcuts are enabled, multicast traffic fails to be forwarded if the next-hop interface directly recurse to the unicast IGP TE tunnel's outbound interface. To resolve this issue, run the multicast recursive-lookup local-mt enable command to enable the device to recurse original next hops of multicast routes to MIGP shortcuts. Physical interfaces are then used as the next-hop outbound interfaces of multicast routes, and multicast traffic can be forwarded normally.\nPrerequisites\nMulticast routing has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command.\nPrecautions\nThe multicast recursive-lookup local-mt enable command applies only to public network devices."
