    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn multicast NAT, to translate an input multicast stream into output multicast streams, you must create a multicast NAT instance. To simplify the multicast NAT configuration, run the multicast-nat instance command to create a multicast NAT instance so that input multicast streams can be associated with the multicast NAT instance.\nPrerequisites\nMulticast NAT has been globally enabled using the multicast-nat enable command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the multicast-nat bind command in the traffic behavior view to bind the multicast NAT instance to the traffic behavior.\nApply the traffic policy on the inbound interface of multicast streams, so that input multicast streams are associated with the multicast NAT instance.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only in the admin VS."
