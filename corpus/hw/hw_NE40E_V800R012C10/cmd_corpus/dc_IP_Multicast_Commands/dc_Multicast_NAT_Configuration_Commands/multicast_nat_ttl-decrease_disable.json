    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn multicast NAT, input and output multicast streams travel through different interfaces. Normally, the TTL value of multicast packets decreases by 1 after the packets pass through an outbound interface. If you do not want to decrease the TTL value of multicast packets, run the multicast-nat ttl-decrease disable command to disable TTL decrease for multicast packets.\nPrerequisites\nMulticast NAT has been globally enabled using the multicast-nat enable command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only in the admin VS."
