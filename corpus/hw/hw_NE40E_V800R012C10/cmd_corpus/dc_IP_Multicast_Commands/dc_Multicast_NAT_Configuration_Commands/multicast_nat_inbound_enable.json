    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore translating an input multicast stream into output multicast streams with different characteristics (source IP address, destination IP address, and destination port number), you must run the multicast-nat enable command to enable multicast NAT globally. Additionally, you must run the multicast-nat inbound enable command to enable multicast NAT on an inbound interface of multicast streams.\nPrerequisites\nMulticast NAT has been globally enabled using the multicast-nat enable command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only in the admin VS.The interface must work in Layer 3 mode, that is, the portswitch command cannot be run on the interface.The interface cannot be an Eth-Trunk member interface."
