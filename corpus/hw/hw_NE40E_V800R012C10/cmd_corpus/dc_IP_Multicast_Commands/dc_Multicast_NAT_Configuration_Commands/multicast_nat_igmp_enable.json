    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a multicast NAT networking environment, a third-party network may exist between a multicast source server and router. Multicast NAT IGMP can be enabled on the router's interface to divert multicast traffic for the multicast source server.\nPrerequisites\nMulticast NAT has been globally enabled using the multicast-nat enable command.Multicast NAT has been enabled on an interface using the multicast-nat inbound enable command.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThis command is mutually exclusive with the igmp enable command.This command is mutually exclusive with the pim sm command.This command is mutually exclusive with the sma enable command.If a device has a slave main control board and multicast NAT IGMP is enabled, a controller is disconnected from the device during a master/slave control board switchover. In this case, the controller needs to periodically check the connection status and initiate a connection."
