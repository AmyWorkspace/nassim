    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer advertise-ext-community command is used to enable a device to advertise an extended community attribute to a specified peer or peer group. If a device advertises an extended community attribute to a specified peer group, all the members of the peer group will inherit the configuration. This simplifies the application of routing policies and facilitates route maintenance and management.\nPrerequisites\nA specific extended community attribute has been defined in a routing policy.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the peer advertise-ext-community command is run to configure a device to advertise an extended community attribute to its peer, routing updates sent by the peer carry the extended community attribute."
