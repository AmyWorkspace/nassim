    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nLocal_Pref is used to determine the optimal route for the traffic that leaves an AS. If BGP receives from different IBGP peers multiple routes to the same destination address but with different next hops, it selects the route with the largest Local_Pref value.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf more than one Local_Pref is configured for BGP routes, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThe Local_Pref is valid among IBGP peers and is not advertised to other ASs."
