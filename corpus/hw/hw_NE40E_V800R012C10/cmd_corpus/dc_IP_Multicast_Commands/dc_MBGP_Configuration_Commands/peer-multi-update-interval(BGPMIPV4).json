    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen routes change, the Router sends routing updates to notify its peers. If a route changes frequently, the peer route-update-interval command can be used to adjust the interval at which Update packets are sent for changes of this route. This frees the Router from sending Update packets for every route change.\nPrerequisites\nAn MBGP peer or peer group has been configured using the group and the peer group command.\nIf the peer route-update-interval command is used but no peer exists, a message is displayed, indicating that the peer does not exist.\nPrecautions\nIf a route is removed or added, the Router sends an Update (Withdraw) packet to its peers immediately, without waiting the interval set using the peer route-update-interval command to expire."
