    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer filter-policy export command is used to configure an ACL-based policy for filtering routes to be advertised to peers.\nA proper basic ACL needs to be selected based on the address family of a peer.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer filter-policy export command is run multiple times, the latest configuration overwrites the previous one. For example, if the peer 2001:DB8:2::2 filter-policy 2600 export command is run and then the peer 2001:DB8:2::2 filter-policy 2400 export command is run, the configuration of the peer 2001:DB8:2::2 filter-policy 2400 export command overwrites that of the peer 2001:DB8:2::2 filter-policy 2600 export command.\nPrecautions\nWhen the rule command is run to configure rules for a named ACL, only the source address range specified by source and the time period specified by time-range take effect.\nThe peer route-filter export command is mutually exclusive with the peer route-filter export commands."
