    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNormally, a cluster has only one RR. The router ID of an RR identifies the cluster to which the RR belongs.\nConfiguring multiple RRs in a cluster can enhance the stability of the network. If a cluster has more than one RR, the reflector cluster-id command needs to be used to set the same cluster ID for the RRs. This avoids routing loops."
