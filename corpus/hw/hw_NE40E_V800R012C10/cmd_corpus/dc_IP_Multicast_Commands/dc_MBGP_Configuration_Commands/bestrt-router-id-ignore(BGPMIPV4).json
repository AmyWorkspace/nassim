    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen receiving multiple routes with the same prefix from multiple peers, MBGP needs to select an optimal route from these routes. Configuring MBGP not to compare the router IDs contained in routes when selecting the optimal route can prevent unnecessary route switching.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen selecting the optimal route, MBGP does not compare the router IDs and peer IP addresses contained in routes after the bestroute router-id-ignore command is run."
