    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo check information about slow MBGP peers, run the display bgp multicast slow-peer command. The information includes the time when a peer began to be identified as a slow peer, the time when a peer last exited from the slow peer state, the number of times a peer has been identified as a slow peer, and the remaining time for a peer to exit from the slow peer state.\nThe display multicast bgp peer command displays BGP peer information. You can implement the following operations based on the command output:\nTo check the status of MBGP connectionsTo check information about a MBGP peerTo check whether a MBGP peer is configured using the peer as-number commandTo check whether a MBGP peer is deleted using the undo peer as-number command"
