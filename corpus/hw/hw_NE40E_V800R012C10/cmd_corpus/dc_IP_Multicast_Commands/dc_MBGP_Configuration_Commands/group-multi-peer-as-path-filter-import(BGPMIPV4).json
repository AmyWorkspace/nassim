    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the peer as-path-filter import command is used to apply a route filtering policy based on an AS_Path list to BGP routes to be received from a specified peer group, the routers that do not match the policy are filtered out.\nPrerequisites\nThe ip as-path-filter command has been run to define an AS-Path filter.\nPrecautions\nOnly one AS_Path filter can be used to filter routes to be received from the same peer.\nThe peer as-path-filter import command is mutually exclusive with the peer route-filter import commands."
