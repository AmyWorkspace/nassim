    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe bestroute med-none-as-maximum command takes effect in MBGP route selection and is used only when no MED is in the route attributes.\nConfiguration Impact\nDuring MBGP route selection, if the bestroute med-none-as-maximum command is run, a route without any MED is assigned the maximum MED of 4294967295.\nPrecautions\nIf no MED is in the route attributes and the bestroute med-none-as-maximum command is not run, the system probably cannot select an optimal route."
