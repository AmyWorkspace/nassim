    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the MBGP deterministic-MED function is enabled, when an optimal route is to be selected from routes that are received from different ASs and carry the same prefix, routes are first grouped based on the leftmost AS in the AS_Path attribute. Routes with the same leftmost AS are grouped together, and after comparison, an optimal route is selected for the group. The group optimal route is then compared with optimal routes from other groups to determine the final optimal route. This mode of route selection ensures that the sequence in which routes are received is irrelevant to the result of route selection.\nIf the MBGP deterministic-MED function is disabled, routes are compared against each other according to the sequence in which they are received. In this manner, the sequence in which routes are received is relevant to the route selection result.\nFor detailed application of this command, see Configuration Guide > IP Routing > BGP Configuration > BGP Route Selection Rules > Route Attributes > MED."
