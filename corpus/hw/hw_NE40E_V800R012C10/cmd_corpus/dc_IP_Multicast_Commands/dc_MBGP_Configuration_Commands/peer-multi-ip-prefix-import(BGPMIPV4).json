    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer ip-prefix import command can be used to configure a route filtering policy that is based on an IP prefix list for filtering BGP routes to be received from a specified peer, implementing route control.\nPrerequisites\nIf the peer ip-prefix command specifies an IP prefix list that does not exist for a peer, use the ip ip-prefix command to create an IP prefix list.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf an IP prefix list is specified for a peer group, all the members of the peer group inherit the configuration.\nAfter an IP prefix list is specified for a peer, the peer filter the routes received from other peers based on the IP prefix list. Only the routes that pass the filtering of the IP prefix list can be received.\nPrecautions\nThe peer ip-prefix import command is mutually exclusive with the peer route-filter import commands."
