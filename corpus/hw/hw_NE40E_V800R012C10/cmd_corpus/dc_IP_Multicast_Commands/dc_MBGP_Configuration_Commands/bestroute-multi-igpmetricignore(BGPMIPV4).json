    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an MBGP network, a device often receives multiple routes with the same prefix but different paths from different peers. To forward traffic to that prefix address, MBGP needs to select an optimal route from these routes. By default, MBGP will compare the IGP metrics of these routes to their MBGP next hops and select a route with the smallest IGP metric.\nThe bestroute igp-metric-ignore command can be run to configure MBGP to ignore the IGP metrics in route selection based on customers' routing requirements.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the bestroute igp-metric-ignore command is run, MBGP does not compare the IGP metrics of routes to MBGP next hops."
