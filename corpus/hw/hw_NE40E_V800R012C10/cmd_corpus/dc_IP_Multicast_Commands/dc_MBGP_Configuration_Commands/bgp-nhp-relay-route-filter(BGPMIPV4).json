    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBGP needs route recursion in case of next hops. If route recursion is not limited, BGP routes may be incorrectly iterated, causing traffic loss. Therefore, next hops should perform recursion according to certain conditions.To control route recursion based on a route-filter, run the nexthop recursive-lookup route-filter command. If a target recursive route is filtered out by the route-filter, the route is considered unreachable. In this manner, BGP route recursion will fail.\nPrerequisites\nThe target recursive route has been determined, and a route-filter has been configured.Before configuring a route-filter, ensure that all desired target recursive routes will not be filtered out by the route-filter.\nPrecautions\nThe command does not apply to the routes received from LinkLocal peers."
