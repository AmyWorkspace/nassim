    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFull-meshed connections need to be established between IBGP peers to ensure the connectivity between the MBGP peers. If an MBGP network is large, it is costly to establish a fully-meshed network.\nThe VRP allows users to configure an RR in order to solve this problem. One MBGP peer is configured as the RR. Other MBGP peers are configured as clients. Each client establishes a peer relationship with the RR to exchange routing information. The RR transmits (reflects) routing information among the clients."
