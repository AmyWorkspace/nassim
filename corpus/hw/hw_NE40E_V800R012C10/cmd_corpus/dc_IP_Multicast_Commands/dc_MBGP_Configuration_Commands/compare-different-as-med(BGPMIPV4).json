    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe command is used to control the MEDs to change the policy of MBGP route selection. If the compare-different-as-med command is run, MBGP will compare the MEDs of the routes from different ASs. If there are multiple reachable paths to the same destination, MBGP prefers the route with the smallest MED."
