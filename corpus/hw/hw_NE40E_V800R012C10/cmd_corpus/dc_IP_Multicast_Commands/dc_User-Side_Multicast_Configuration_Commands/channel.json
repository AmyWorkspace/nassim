    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo create a multicast channel and display the channel view, run the channel command.\nWhen a user requests for a multicast program of the channel, the device checks whether the program matches with an any-source or source-specific group specified in the bandwidth limit policy. If the remaining bandwidth is insufficient for the requested program, the device denies the request.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast bas-policy command has been run in the system view.\nThe policy policy-name command has been run in the multicast BAS policy view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the undo channel command is run, all configurations of the specified channel will be deleted.\nPrecautions\nA channel name must be unique on a device. If a channel name conflicts with an existing one, the device displays an error message.A multicast bandwidth limit policy supports a maximum of 128 channels.A channel supports a maximum of 16 programs.This command is supported only on the admin VS."
