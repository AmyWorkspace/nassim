    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA Router on an IPv6 PIM-SM network needs to send Hello messages periodically to maintain PIM neighbor relationships. To set the interval at which IPv6 PIM interfaces send Hello messages, run the timer hello command. To have a Router rapidly sense IPv6 PIM neighbor changes, set a Hello packet sending interval smaller than the configured neighbor timeout period.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast ipv6 routing-enable command in the public network instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the timer hello command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
