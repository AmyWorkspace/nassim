    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the Anycast RP is configured in a multicast domain, after an RP receives a Register message, it checks the source address in the Register message. If the Register message is sent by the source's designated router (DR), the RP forwards the Register message to Anycast RP peers. If the Register message is sent by an Anycast RP peer, it does not forward the Register message.\nWhen forwarding a PIM Register message to other Anycast RP peers, the local RP needs to use its own IP address (called the local address) as the source address of the Register message and use the addresses of Anycast RP peers as the destination addresses of the Register message. In such a manner, Anycast RP peers can learn source/group information from each other. The local-address command is used to set a local address for an Anycast RP.\nPrecautions\nThe local address must be different from the Anycast RP address.\nSetting a Loopback interface address as the local address of the Anycast RP is recommended."
