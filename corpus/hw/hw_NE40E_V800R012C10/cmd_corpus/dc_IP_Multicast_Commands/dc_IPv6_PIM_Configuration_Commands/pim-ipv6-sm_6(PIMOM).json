    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAt the access layer, if PIM is enabled on a router interface directly connected to a host network segment, the interface can set up PIM neighbor relationships and process various PIM protocol packets. If attackers send a large number of PIM IPv6 Hello messages, the router may be crashed.\nTo address this problem, enable PIM silent on the interface using the pim ipv6 silent command. After PIM silent is enabled on an interface, all PIM packets will be discard by this interface, and all PIM neighbors and PIM state machines will be deleted for this interface. The interface automatically becomes a static designated router (DR). MLD functions, however, are not affected on the interface.\nPrecautions\nPIM silent applies only to interfaces directly connected to a host network segment on which only one PIM device is deployed.The pim ipv6 silent command is mutually exclusive with the pim ipv6 timer dr-switch-delay command."
