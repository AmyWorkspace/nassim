    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo protect a Router against IPv6 Join/Prune message attacks, run the pim ipv6 join-policy command to configure a join information filter policy by setting valid source and group address ranges for IPv6 Join/Prune messages. The policy enables the Router to discard join information that does not match the specified filter policy.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast ipv6 routing-enable command has been run in the instance to which the interface belongs. This command is valid only for PIM-SM.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the asm or ssm parameter is configured more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one. You can configure both a basic ACL and an advanced ACL to filter the join information with group addresses in the ASM address range and SSM address range, respectively.\nAfter the pim ipv6 join-policy command is run:\nIf join information carried in a Join/Prune message matches the permit clause defined in the IPv6 ACL, the join information is accepted, and an (S, G) entry is created for the join information.If join information carried in a Join/Prune message matches the deny clause defined in the IPv6 ACL or no action is defined for the join information, the join information is discarded, and no (S, G) entry is created for the join information.If the ACL specified by the jpPolicyAclNum or acl6-name jpPolicyName parameter does not exist, all join information is discarded.\n\nPrecautions\nThe command can be used to filter PIM Join messages in either of the following modes:(1) The pim ipv6 join-policy { asm { <basic-acl6-number> | acl6-name <acl6-name> } | ssm { <advanced-acl6-number> | acl6-name <acl6-name> } } command filters PIM Join messages with multicast group addresses in the ASM or SSM address range. If PIM Join messages with multicast group addresses in the ASM address range need to be filtered, the asm parameter must be specified in the command. If PIM Join messages with multicast group addresses in the SSM address range need to be filtered, the ssm parameter must be specified in the command.(2) The pim ipv6 join-policy {<advanced-acl6-number> | acl6-name <acl6-name> } } command filters PIM Join messages with multicast group addresses both in the ASM and SSM address ranges.The precautions for configuring filtering rules are as follows:When configuring filtering rules for an advanced ACL or a named ACL:\nFor the rules used to filter PIM Join messages with multicast group addresses in the ASM address range:\n(1) To filter (*, G) PIM Join messages, the source address in the ACL rule must be set to 0::0 or any, and the destination address must be set to the multicast group address based on which the messages are to be filtered.\n(2) To filter (S, G) PIM Join messages:\nIn an ACL rule, if the source address is set to a multicast source address and the destination address is set to a multicast group address, the messages are filtered based on the multicast source address and multicast group address.\nIn an ACL rule, if the source address is set to a multicast source address and the destination address is set to any, the messages are filtered based on the multicast source address.\nIn an ACL rule, if the source address is set to any and the destination address is set to a multicast group address, the messages are filtered based on the multicast group address.\n(3) The filtering rules do not take effect on (S, G, RPT) PIM Join messages.For the rules used to filter PIM Join messages with multicast group addresses in the SSM address range:\n(1) To filter (S, G) PIM Join messages:\nIn an ACL rule, if the source address is set to a multicast source address and the destination address is set to a multicast group address, the messages are filtered based on the multicast source address and multicast group address.\nIn an ACL rule, if the source address is set to a multicast source address and the destination address is set to any, the messages are filtered based on the multicast source address.\nIn an ACL rule, if the source address is set to any and the destination address is set to a multicast group address, the messages are filtered based on the multicast group address."
