    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf multiple C-BSRs are deployed in a PIM-SM domain, a BSR is elected based on the following rules:\nThe C-BSR with the highest priority wins.If the C-BSRs have the same priority, the C-BSR with the largest IP address wins.\nTo have a C-BSR be elected as the BSR, run the c-bsr priority command to set a larger priority value for the C-BSR than those of the other C-BSRs.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast ipv6 routing-enable command in the public network instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the c-bsr priority command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThe priority value set using the c-bsr priority command is effective for all C-BSRs configured on the router. The c-bsr command can be used to change the priority of a C-BSR configured on a specified interface.\nThe c-bsr command is valid only for the specified interface. When both the c-bsr priority command and the c-bsr command are run, the system prefers the configuration of the c-bsr command."
