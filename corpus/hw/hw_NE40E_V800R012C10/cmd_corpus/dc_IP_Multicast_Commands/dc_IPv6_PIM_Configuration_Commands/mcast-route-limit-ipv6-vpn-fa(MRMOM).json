    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a proper limit on the number of PIM-SM entries in the IPv6 address family of a VPN instance, run the multicast ipv6 limit pim sm command. This prevents multicast services from being affected by an improper limit on the number of PIM-SM entries\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast ipv6 routing-enable command has been run in the IPv6 address family of a VPN instance.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the number of PIM-SM entries in the IPv6 address family of a VPN instance reaches a configured limit, new entries fail to be created and the alarm PIM_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.149.4.0.32 hwPimVrfTypeSGExceed is triggered.\nIf upper-limit upper-limit-value is specified and the number of PIM-SM entries in the IPv6 address family of a VPN instance reaches the configured alarm trigger threshold, the alarm PIM_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.149.4.0.30 hwPimVrfTypeSGThresholdExceed is triggered.\nStatically created (*, G) and (S, G) entries are not affected by a limit on the number of PIM-SM entries in the IPv6 address family of a VPN instance. The limit takes effect only on dynamic entries."
