    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA Router creates a timer for each (S, G) entry. To set a timeout period for those timers, run the source-lifetime command. The Router starts the timer after receiving multicast packets from a multicast source for the first time. Each time the Router receives a multicast packet from the source, the Router resets the timer. If no multicast packets are received before timer times out, the (S, G) entry is considered invalid.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast ipv6 routing-enable command in the public network instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the source-lifetime command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
