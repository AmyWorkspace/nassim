    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nHello messages sent by the router carry lan-delay and override-interval. override-interval specifies the period during which a downstream router overrides the prune action. When the override-interval values on all routers on the same link are different, the maximum value of these values is used.\nIf one router receives a Prune message from an upstream interface, other downstream routers still exist in the LAN. If the router still needs to receive multicast data, it must send a Join message to the upstream interface to override the prune action within the set override-interval value.When receiving a Prune message from a downstream device, the router does not perform the prune action immediately until the PPT expires. The PPT equals the lan-delay value plus the override-interval value. If a device receives a Join message from its downstream device before the PPT expires, it cancels the prune action.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast ipv6 routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view.\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast ipv6 routing-enable command in the public network instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the hello-option override-interval command is run several times, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
