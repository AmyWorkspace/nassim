    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore using the timer spt-switch command, you must use the spt-switch-threshold command to set the rate threshold that can trigger data switching from an RPT to an SPT. Otherwise, running the timer spt-switch command is meaningless.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast ipv6 routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the timer spt-switch command is run several times, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
