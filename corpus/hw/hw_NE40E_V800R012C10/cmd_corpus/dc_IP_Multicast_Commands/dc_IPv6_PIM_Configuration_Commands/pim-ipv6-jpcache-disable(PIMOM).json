    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe efficiency for sending PIM Join/Prune messages in a package is higher than that for separately sending a large number of PIM Join/Prune messages. By default, a device sends PIM Join/Prune messages in a package. Because the size of a PIM Join/Prune message package is large, devices that have poor performance cannot receive the PIM Join/Prune message package. If such devices exist, run the join-prune triggered-message-cache disable command to disable the Join/Prune message packaging function to prevent packet discarding."
