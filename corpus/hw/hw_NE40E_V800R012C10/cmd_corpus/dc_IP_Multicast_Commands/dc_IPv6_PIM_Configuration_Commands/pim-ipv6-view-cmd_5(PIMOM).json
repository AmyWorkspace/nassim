    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a router receives a Join/Prune message, the router updates the downstream interface status to maintain the (S, G) or (*, G) entry. To set the interval at which PIM interfaces send Join/Prune messages upstream, run the timer join-prune command.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast ipv6 routing-enable command in the public network instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the timer join-prune command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThe interval at which PIM interfaces send Join/Prune messages to an upstream neighbor must be shorter than the holdtime specified for Join/Prune messages; otherwise, the upstream neighbor times out."
