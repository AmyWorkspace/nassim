    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn RP is elected from C-RPs based on the following rules:\nThe C-RP wins if it serves the group address that has the longest mask.If group addresses that all C-RPs serve have the same mask length, the C-RP with the highest priority wins (a larger priority value indicates a lower priority).If the C-RPs have the same priority, the hash function is started. The C-RP with the greatest calculated value wins.If none of the above criteria can determine a winner, the C-RP with the largest address wins.To have a C-RP be elected as the RP, run the c-rp priority command to set a lower priority value for the C-RP than those of the other C-RPs.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast ipv6 routing-enable command in the public network instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the c-rp priority command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
