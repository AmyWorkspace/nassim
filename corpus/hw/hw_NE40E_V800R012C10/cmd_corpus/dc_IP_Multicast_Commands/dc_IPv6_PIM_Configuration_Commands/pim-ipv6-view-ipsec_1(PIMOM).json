    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a multicast network, forged IPv6 PIM Hello messages may be used to attack devices, causing devices unable to forward multicast traffic. To protect a device against attacks launched using forged IPv6 PIM Hello messages, run the hello ipsec sa command to configure the device to authenticate sent and received IPv6 PIM Hello messages based on a specified SA.\nSome non-Huawei devices can encrypt and authenticate only IPv6 PIM Hello messages. Therefore, the hello ipsec sa command configuration allows a Huawei device to perform IPsec authentication only for IPv6 PIM Hello messages.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast ipv6 routing-enable command.Basic IPsec functions have been configured.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the hello ipsec sa command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one. If the hello ipsec sa and ipsec sa commands are both configured, the command configured later overrides the command configured earlier.\nThe function of this command is the same as the function of the pim ipv6 hello ipsec sa command in the interface view. The configuration in the interface view takes precedence over the configuration in the IPv6 PIM view. The configuration in the IPv6 PIM view is used only when the configuration in the interface view is not available."
