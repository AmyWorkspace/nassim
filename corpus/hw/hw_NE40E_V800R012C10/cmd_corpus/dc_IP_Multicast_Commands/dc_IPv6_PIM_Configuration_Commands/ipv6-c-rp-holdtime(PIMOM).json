    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the c-rp holdtime command is run for a C-RP, the C-RP encapsulates interval in an Advertisement message and sends it to the BSR. The BSR obtains this interval from the message and starts the timer. If the BSR does not receive the Advertisement message from the C-RP after the timeout period expires, the BSR regards the C-RP invalid or unreachable.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast ipv6 routing-enable command in the public network instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the c-rp holdtime command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
