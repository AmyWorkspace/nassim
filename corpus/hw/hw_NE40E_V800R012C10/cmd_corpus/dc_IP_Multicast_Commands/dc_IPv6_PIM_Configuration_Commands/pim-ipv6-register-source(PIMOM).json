    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the source's DR uses more than one or a filtered out IPv6 address to send Register messages to the rendezvous point (RP), errors occur in the registration process and extra traffic occupies bandwidth on the network. To address this issue, run the register-source command to specify an IPv6 unicast address (a loopback interface's address is recommended) using which the source's DR sends Register messages.\nPrerequisites\nPIM-SM has been enabled on the interface of the IPv6 address to be specified by the ipv6-address parameter.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the register-source command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThe command configuration is effective only when the interface of the specified IPv6 address is in the Up state."
