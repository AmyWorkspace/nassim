    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the primary link recovers in an NG MVPN 1+1 scenario, the system waits for a period of time before switching traffic back to the primary link. To set a switchback wait time, run the multicast wtr command. If a network has a large number of multicast entries (for example, 1000 or more), setting the switchback wait time to a value greater than 600s is recommended.\nPrerequisites\nMulticast VPN FRR has been enabled using the c-multicast frr command in the VPN instance IPv4 address family MVPN view."
