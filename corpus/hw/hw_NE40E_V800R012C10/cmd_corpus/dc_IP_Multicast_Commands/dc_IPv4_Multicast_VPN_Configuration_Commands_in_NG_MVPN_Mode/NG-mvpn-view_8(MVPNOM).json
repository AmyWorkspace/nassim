    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel dual-root 1+1 protection scenarios, multicast data may be switched from the primary inclusive-provider multicast service interface (I-PMSI) tunnel to the backup I-PMSI tunnel if the selective-provider multicast service interface (S-PMSI) tunnel is not ready during data switching. To solve this problem, start a tunnel status check delay timer on leaf PEs:\nBefore the timer expires, leaf PEs delete tunnel protection groups to skip the status check of the primary I-PMSI or S-PMSI tunnel.After the timer expires, leaf PEs start to check the primary I-PMSI or S-PMSI tunnel status again.\nThe tunnel-detect-delay command allows you to configure the value of the tunnel status check delay timer.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the tunnel-detect-delay command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
