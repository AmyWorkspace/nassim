    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a network is unstable and does not have high forwarding performance requirements in NG MVPN scenarios, setting the forwarding mode to aggregation is recommended, which can effectively increase the convergence speed and minimize multicast traffic loss when tunnels flap. To configure the aggregation forwarding mode, run the ng-mvpn forwarding-mode aggregation command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the aggregation forwarding mode is configured, existing multicast entries will be deleted and new multicast entries will be generated, which reduces the board forwarding performance by 50%.\nPrecautions\nIf the aggregation forwarding mode is set on the ingress PE (using the ng-mvpn forwarding-mode aggregation command) in an NG MVPN scenario, intra-tunnel trunk load balancing is not supported, but inter-tunnel trunk load balancing is supported."
