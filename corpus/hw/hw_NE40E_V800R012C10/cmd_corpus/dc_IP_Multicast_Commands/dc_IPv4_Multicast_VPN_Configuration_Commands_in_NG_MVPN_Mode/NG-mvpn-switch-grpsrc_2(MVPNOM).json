    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn NG MVPN uses the I-PMSI tunnel to send multicast data to receivers. The I-PMSI tunnel connects to all PEs on the MVPN and sends multicast data to these PEs regardless of whether these PEs have receivers. If some PEs do not have receivers, this implementation will cause redundant traffic, wasting bandwidth resources and increasing PEs' burdens.\nS-PMSI tunnels solve this problem by sending multicast data only to PEs interested in the data.\nTo configure the address pool range and criteria for switching between I-PMSI and S-PMSI tunnels, run the group command.\nThe restrictions on the wildcard parameter are as follows:\nWildcard (*, *):\nWildcard (*, *) and I-PMSI cannot be configured together.Wildcard (*, *) and wildcard (*, G) cannot be configured together.\n\nPrecautions\nUp to 1024 such commands can be configured for each VPN, and up to 16384 such commands can be configured on an entire device, and the maximum limit value in a group command configuration is 8192.Up to 8192 S-PMSI tunnels can be configured for each VPN instance.If the address pool range specified in a group command overlaps with a previously configured address pool range, the command cannot be configured.If you want to change the tunnel type configured for an address pool range, you must delete the existing group command configuration and then run the group command with the desired tunnel type."
