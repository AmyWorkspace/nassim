    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf PIM-SM MDT setup is not across the public network, you can configure a PE or CE as a VPN instance's RP. If a CE is configured as an RP, the CE needs to establish an MDSP peer relationship with its connected PE. To enable this PE to transmit (S, G) entry information in BGP Source Active A-D routes to the CE configured as the RP, run the export msdp command.\nPrecautions\nIf a PE is configured as a VPN instance's RP, you do not need to run the export msdp command."
