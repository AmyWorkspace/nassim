    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen multicast data is switched back from an S-PMSI tunnel to an I-PMSI tunnel, the device starts the S-PMSI tunnel withdraw delay timer to prevent service interruptions in case of an I-PMSI tunnel failure during the switchback. If the default value of the timer does not meet actual requirements, run the tunnel-withdraw-delay command to set a longer delay.\nIf multicast data needs to be switched to the S-PMSI tunnel again before the timer expires, the data can be directly switched to the S-PMSI tunnel. If such a switchover is not required, the S-PMSI tunnel is withdrawn when the timer expires.\nPrecautions\nIf a long delay is set using the tunnel-withdraw-delay command, excessive tunnel resources may be consumed before the delay expires, which will then delay new services that need to be transmitted over an S-PMSI tunnel."
