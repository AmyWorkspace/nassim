    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the NG MVPN sharing tree scenario, when the RPT switches to the SPT, the root PE of RPT prunes the received BGP source-active routes. To delay the pruning, run the rpt-prune-delay command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the rpt-prune-delay command is run several times, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThe pruning delay time configured using the rpt-prune-delay command takes effect on next RPT-SPT switching.\nThe command can be only configured on the root PE of an RPT."
