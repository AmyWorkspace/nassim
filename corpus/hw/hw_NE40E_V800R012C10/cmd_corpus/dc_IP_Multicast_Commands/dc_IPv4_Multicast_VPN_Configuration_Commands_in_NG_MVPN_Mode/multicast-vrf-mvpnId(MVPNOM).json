    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an MVPN ID for a VPN instance in the IPv4 address family view, that is, an IP address for the originator PE in an MPVN instance, run the multicast mvpn command. After the command is run, the originator PE uses the specified MVPN ID, not the global MVPN ID, to apply for tunnel resources.\nThe specified MVPN ID works with static routes to generate P2MP mLDP LSPs, implementing NG MVPN 1+1 node protection.\nPrecautions\nIf the multicast mvpn command is not run in the VPN instance IPv4 address family view, the MVPN ID specified in the system view is used. If MVPN IDs are specified in both the system view and VPN instance IPv4 address family view, only the MVPN ID specified in the VPN instance IPv4 address family view takes effect."
