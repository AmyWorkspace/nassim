    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn NG MVPN uses the I-PMSI tunnel to send multicast data to receivers. The I-PMSI tunnel connects to all PEs on the MVPN and sends multicast data to these PEs regardless of whether these PEs have receivers. If some PEs do not have receivers, this implementation will cause redundant traffic, wasting bandwidth resources and increasing PEs' burdens.\nS-PMSI tunnels solve this problem by sending multicast data only to PEs interested in the data.\nTo configure the address pool range and criteria for switching between I-PMSI and S-PMSI tunnels, run the group command.\nPrecautions\nIn (S, G) mode, each VPN instance and device can be configured with a maximum of 1024 and 16384 such commands, respectively. The maximum limit value in each configuration is 8192. Each VPN instance can be configured with a maximum of 8192 S-PMSI tunnels.If the address pool range specified in a group command overlaps with a previously configured address pool range, the command cannot be configured. If you want to change the tunnel type configured for an address pool range, you must delete the existing group command configuration and then run the group command with the desired tunnel type.In actual switching from the I-PMSI tunnel to an S-PMSI tunnel, due to necessary traffic rate calculation and protocol processing, there is a lag of 1 to 30 seconds between the time the multicast data forwarding rate changes and the time a VPN instance starts the switch-delay timer.Before configuring switching criteria for an (S, G) S-PMSI tunnel, configure an I-PMSI tunnel or (*, *) S-PMSI tunnel in a VPN instance."
