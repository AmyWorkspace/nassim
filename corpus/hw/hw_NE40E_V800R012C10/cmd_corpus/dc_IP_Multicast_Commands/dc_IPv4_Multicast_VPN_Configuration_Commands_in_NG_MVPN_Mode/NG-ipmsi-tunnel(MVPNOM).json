    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPMSI tunnels are the logical tunnels used by the public network to transmit VPN multicast data, and P-tunnels are the actual tunnels used by the public network to transmit VPN multicast data. A sender provider edge (PE) uses PMSI tunnels to send specific VPN multicast data to receiver PEs. The receiver PEs determine whether to accept the VPN multicast traffic based on PMSI tunnel information.\nI-PMSI tunnels can be established using point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE or multipoint extensions for LDP (mLDP). Before specifying the protocol to establish an I-PMSI tunnel, run the ipmsi-tunnel command to enter the MVPN I-PMSI view.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the mldp command to specify mLDP to establish an I-PMSI tunnel, or run the mpls te command to specify P2MP TE to establish an I-PMSI tunnel.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo ipmsi-tunnel command deletes all configurations in the MVPN I-PMSI view. Exercise caution when running the command."
