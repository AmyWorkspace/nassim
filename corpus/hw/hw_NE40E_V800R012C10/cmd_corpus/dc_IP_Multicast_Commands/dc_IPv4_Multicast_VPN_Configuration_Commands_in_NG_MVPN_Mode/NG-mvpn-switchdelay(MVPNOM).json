    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe sender PE starts a switch-delay timer before switching multicast data from the I-PMSI tunnel to an S-PMSI tunnel. To configure the switch-delay timer value, run the switch-delay command. The sender PE continues to detect the multicast data forwarding rate before the switch-delay timer expires. If the forwarding rate is consistently above the specified switching threshold throughout the timer lifecycle, the sender PE switches multicast data from the I-PMSI tunnel to an S-PMSI tunnel. If the forwarding rate is consistently below the specified switching threshold throughout the timer lifecycle, the sender PE still uses the I-PMSI tunnel to send multicast data.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the switch-delay command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIn actual switching from the I-PMSI tunnel to an S-PMSI tunnel, due to necessary traffic rate calculation and protocol processing, there is a lag of 1 to 30 seconds between the time the multicast data forwarding rate changes and the time a VPN instance starts the switch-delay timer. As a result, the actual switching delay is 1 to 30 seconds longer than the specified switching delay."
