    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an MVPN ID, run the multicast mvpn command. The MVPN ID is the IP address of the originator provider edge (PE) in an MVPN. An MVPN ID can be used as:\nOriginator router's IP address field value in auto-discovery (A-D) routes\nAdministrator field value in the VRF Route Import Extended Community attribute in BGP VPNv4 routes\nIf the multicast mvpn command is not run, PEs do not send A-D routes, and BGP VPNv4 routes do not carry the VRF Route Import Extended Community attribute.\nPrecautions\nConfiguration guidelines for MVPN IDs are as follows:\nThe MVPN ID of the user-end device of an RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel must be equal to an MPLS LSR ID.\nThe MVPN ID of an mLDP P2MP tunnel can be a valid unicast address, excluding 0.0.0.x and loopback addresses 127.x.x.x. Using an MPLS LSR ID as an MVPN ID is recommended.\nThe MVPN ID of a PE must be unique in an MVPN.\nIf MVPN has been enabled using the mvpn command, the undo multicast mvpn command cannot be executed. Before using the undo multicast mvpn command, run the undo mvpn command to disable MVPN of all VPN instances."
