    "FuncDef": "The timer other-querier-present command sets a global keepalive period of other IGMP queriers.\nThe undo timer other-querier-present command restores the default value.\nThe formula used to calculate the keepalive period of other IGMP queriers is: Keepalive period of other IGMP queriers = Robustness variable x Interval for sending IGMP general query messages + 1/2 x Maximum response time of IGMP Query messages. By default, if the default values of the robustness variable, the interval for sending IGMP general query messages, and the maximum response time of IGMP Query messages are used, the keepalive period of other IGMP queriers is 125s.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe function of this command is the same as the function of the igmp timer other-querier-present command used in the interface view. The configuration in the IGMP view is effective for all interfaces, whereas the configuration in the interface view is effective only for the specified interface. The configuration in the interface view takes precedence over the configuration in the IGMP view. The configuration in the IGMP view is used only when the configuration in the interface view is not available."
