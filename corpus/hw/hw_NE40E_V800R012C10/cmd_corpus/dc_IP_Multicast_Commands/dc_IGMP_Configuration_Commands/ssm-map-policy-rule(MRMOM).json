    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen users connected to different interfaces want to watch programs multicast by different multicast sources, run the group command to configure different SSM mappings for IPv4 policies of different interfaces. After that, IGMP packets received by different interfaces can be mapped to different multicast sources and users' requirements can be answered.\nPrerequisites\nSSM mapping and a corresponding policy have been enabled on the interface using the igmp ssm-mapping enable policy command."
