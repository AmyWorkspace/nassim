    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf IGMP snooping proxy is configured on a downstream Layer 2 device, the device replaces the source MAC address and source IP address of the IGMP Report message from a user. After the IGMP Report message from the downstream Layer 2 device reaches the BRAS device, the BRAS device checks the source MAC address and source IP address of the IGMP Query message and discards the message. To resolve the problem, run the igmp report loose check command in the BAS interface view to configure the device not to check the source MAC address and source IP address of a received IGMP Report message.\nPrerequisites\nLayer 2 access has been configured using the access-type layer2-subscriber command or Layer 2 leased line access has been configured using the access-type layer2-leased-line command.\nPrecautions\nThis command applies only to Layer 2 DHCP users, Layer 2 static users, and Layer 2 private line users."
