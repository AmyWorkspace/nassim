    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn IGMPv3, the lastmember-queryinterval command can also be used to set the interval at which an IGMP querier sends group/source-specific messages after receiving a Report message about the change of the relationship between the multicast group and its source list.\nThe function of this command is the same as the function of the igmp lastmember-queryinterval command in the interface view. The configuration in the IGMP view is effective for all interfaces, whereas the configuration in the interface view is effective only for the specified interface. The configuration in the interface view takes precedence over the configuration in the IGMP view. The configuration in the IGMP view is used only when the configuration in the interface view is not available."
