    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a host wants to receive multicast data for a multicast group, the host must join the multicast group. Either of the following modes can be used to enable a host to join a multicast group:\nDynamic mode: Run the igmp enable command to enable IGMP on the interface connected to the network segment on which the host resides. Then, the network sends data to the host after the host joins the group and stops sending data after the host leaves the group.Static mode: Run the igmp static-group command to enable IGMP on the interface connected to the network segment on which the host resides. Then, the host becomes a static data receiver of this group, and the network keeps sending data to the host.\nTo learn the status of or locate a fault in a dynamically joined multicast group, run the display igmp group command to view information about the multicast group. The information helps you analyze and locate the fault.\n\nPrecautions\nBefore using the display igmp group command, note the following:\nIf neither vpn-instance nor all-instance is specified, the command displays information about multicast groups in the public network instance.If group-address is specified, the command displays information about the specified IGMP group.If interface is specified, the command displays information about IGMP groups that the specified interface joins.If verbose is specified, the command displays detailed information about IGMP groups."
