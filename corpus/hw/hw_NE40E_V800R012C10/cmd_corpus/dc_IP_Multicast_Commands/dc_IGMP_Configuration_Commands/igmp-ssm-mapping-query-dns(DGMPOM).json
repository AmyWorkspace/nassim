    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe static SSM mapping function requires the configuration of multicast source-group mappings on the multicast device that runs IGMPv3, so that the device can provide the SSM service for users using a lower IGMP version. However, this mode brings huge configuration workloads and cannot be flexibly changed.\nTo solve this problem, you can run the ssm-mapping query dns command to enable the DNS-based SSM mapping function so that the multicast device can provide the SSM service for users through SSM mappings provided by a DNS server.\nPrerequisites\nThe igmp command has been used."
