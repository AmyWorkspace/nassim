    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe default SSM group address range is from 232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255. If a host supports only IGMPv1/v2 Report messages, the host cannot join groups in the SSM group address range. If you want an IGMPv1/v2 host to join groups in the SSM group address range, run the ssm-mapping command configure static SSM mappings.\nGroup addresses not in the SSM group address range apply to the ASM model.\nThe configured SSM source/group address mapping entries take effect only after the igmp ssm-mapping enable command is run on the interface.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe ssm-mapping command can be repeatedly run to configure multiple static SSM mappings. New configurations take effect without overriding the previous one.\nRunning the undo ssm-mapping static all command deletes all static SSM mappings. Therefore, exercise caution when using this command."
