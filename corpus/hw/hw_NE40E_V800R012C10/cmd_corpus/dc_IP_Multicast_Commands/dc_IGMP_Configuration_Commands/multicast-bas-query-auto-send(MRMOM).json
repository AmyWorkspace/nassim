    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a downstream device does not have static router interfaces configured and cannot send user Join/Leave messages, the upstream BRAS device fails to learn user join/leave information. To resolve this issue, run the igmp query auto-send command on a BAS interface of the BRAS device, so that the BRAS device can proactively send Query messages to generate a dynamic router interface and learn user join/leave information, without depending on Join/Leave messages from the downstream device.\nPrecautions\nThis command applies only to GE interfaces, GE sub-interfaces, trunk interfaces, trunk sub-interfaces, and VE sub-interfaces on which the bas command has been run.The igmp query auto-send and user-vlan any-other commands cannot be both run on the same sub-interface.In VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
