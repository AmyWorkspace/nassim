    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a multicast network, forged IGMP messages may be used to attack devices, causing devices unable to forward multicast traffic. To protect a device against attacks launched using forged IGMP messages, run the igmp ipsec sa command to configure an interface to authenticate sent and received IGMP messages based on a specified SA.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command.Basic IPsec functions have been configured.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the igmp ipsec sa command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one. If the igmp ipsec sa and igmp query ipsec sa commands are both configured, the command configured later overrides the command configured earlier.\nThe function of this command is the same as the function of the ipsec sa command in the IGMP view. The configuration in the IGMP view is effective for all interfaces, whereas the configuration in the interface view is effective only for the specified interface. The configuration in the interface view takes precedence over the configuration in the IGMP view. The configuration in the IGMP view is used only when the configuration in the interface view is not available."
