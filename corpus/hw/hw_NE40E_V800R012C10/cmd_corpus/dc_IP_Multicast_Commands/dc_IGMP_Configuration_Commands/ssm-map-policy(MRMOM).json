    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen users connected to different interfaces want to watch programs multicast by different multicast sources, run the ssm-mapping policy command to configure different SSM mapping policies on different interfaces. After that, IGMP packets received by different interfaces can be mapped to different multicast sources and users' requirements can be answered.\nPrerequisites\nSSM mapping and a corresponding policy have been enabled on the interface using the igmp ssm-mapping enable command.\nWhen an IPv4 SSM mapping policy is deleted, all the configuration information of the policy will be deleted."
