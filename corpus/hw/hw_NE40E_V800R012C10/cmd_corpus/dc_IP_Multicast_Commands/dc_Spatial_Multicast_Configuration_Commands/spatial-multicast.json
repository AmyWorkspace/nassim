    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA conventional method for improving the performance of multicast traffic forwarding is to enable inter-board traffic replication on upstream interface boards. This method has high replication performance and bandwidth requirements for an upstream interface board when there are many downstream interface boards. If the upstream interface board cannot meet the requirements, the multicast forwarding performance is affected.\nTo resolve the preceding issue, run the spatial-multicast command to enable spatial multicast. After this function is enabled, the SFUs, instead of the upstream interface board, replicate flows for downstream interface boards, reducing the workload and bandwidth consumption of the upstream interface board.\nConfiguration Impact\nSpatial multicast may cause packet loss during traffic forwarding.\nPrecautions\nThe undo spatial-multicast command execution takes some time. The system does not allow you to enable spatial multicast again before The undo spatial-multicast command is executed completely.\nSpatial multicast cannot work with The virtual cluster function.\nThis command is supported only on The Admin VS."
