If a VPN instance is specified by vpn-instance-name, an MD is specified accordingly. Therefore, the command can be used to display the information about the Switch-Group of a specified MD.\nIf brief is specified, the brief information about all Switch-Groups is displayed in an ascending order of the Switch-Group address.If active is specified, only the information about the Switch-Group that joins the Switch-MDT is displayed in an ascending order of the VPN (S, G) entry.If group is specified, only the information about the Switch-Group related to the public network multicast group is displayed.If sender is specified, only the information about the Switch-Group related to the public network multicast source is displayed.If vpn-source-address is specified, only the information about the Switch-Group related to the VPN multicast source is displayed.If vpn-group-address is specified, only the information about the Switch-Group related to the VPN multicast group is displayed."
