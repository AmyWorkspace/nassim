    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe multicast-vpn ttl propagate command is used on an ingress PE. When MVPN is deployed, MVPN data packets need to be transmitted over a public network, and the public network is transparent, the ingress PE copies the TTLs in the MVPN data packets into public network multicast packets. The egress PE does not copy the TTL values when removing the public network header from the packets.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the TTL in an MVPN packet is too small, the packet is discarded on the public network when the TTL is reduced to 0."
