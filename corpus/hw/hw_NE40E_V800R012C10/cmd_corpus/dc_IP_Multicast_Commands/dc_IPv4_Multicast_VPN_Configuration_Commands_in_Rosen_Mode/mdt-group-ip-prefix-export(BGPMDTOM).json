    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer ip-prefix command can be used to configure a route filtering policy that is based on an IP prefix list to filter routes received or routes to be advertised, implementing route control.\nPrerequisites\nIf the peer ip-prefix command specifies an IP prefix list that does not exist for a peer group, use the ip ip-prefix or ip ipv6-prefix command to create an IP prefix list.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf an IP prefix list is specified for a peer group, all the members of the peer group inherit the configuration.\nAfter an IP prefix list is specified for a peer group, the peer or peers in the peer group filter the routes to be advertised to or received from other peers based on the IP prefix list. Only the routes that pass the filtering of the IP prefix list can be advertised or received.\nPrecautions\nThe peer ip-prefix command is mutually exclusive with the peer route-filter commands."
