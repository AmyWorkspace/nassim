    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a PIM-SM shared network segment, a DR is dynamically elected among candidate Router interfaces. DR election is based on priorities and IP addresses of interfaces on Routers. In a DR election process, Routers exchange Hello messages carrying DR election priorities.\nIf all Routers support Hello messages that carry DR election priorities, the interface with the highest DR election priority wins. If all interfaces have the same DR election priority, the interface with the largest IP address wins.If one or more Routers do not support Hello messages that carry DR priorities, the interface with the largest IP address wins.\nTo change the DR election priority of an interface, run the pim hello-option dr-priority command.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the pim hello-option dr-priority command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
