    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command applies to the PIM-SM domain where a rendezvous point (RP) is dynamically elected using the BSR mechanism. You can run this command on any Router in the domain to view BSR information.\nIf a candidate-bootstrap router (C-BSR) is configured on a Router, the command displays information about the elected BSR and locally configured C-BSR.If a candidate-bootstrap router (C-BSR) is not configured on a Router, the command displays information only about the elected BSR\n\nPrecautions\nIf neither vpn-instance nor all-instance is specified, the command displays information about the BSR in the public network instance."
