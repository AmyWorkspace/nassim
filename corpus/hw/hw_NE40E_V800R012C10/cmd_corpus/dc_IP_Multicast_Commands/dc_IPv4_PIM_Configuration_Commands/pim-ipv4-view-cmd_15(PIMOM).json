    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nHello messages sent by Routers carry lan-delay and override-interval. override-interval refers to the period during which a downstream Router overrides the prune action. When the values of override-interval on all Routers on the same link are different, the maximum value of these values is used.\nIf a Router receives a Prune message from the upstream interface, it indicates that other downstream Routers still exist in the LAN. If the Router still needs to receive multicast data, it must send a Join message to the upstream interface in the override-interval period.\nThe value of PPT is obtained by the value of lan-delay plus the value of override-interval. When receiving a Prune message from a downstream interface, the Router does not perform the prune action until the PPT times out. If the Router receives a Join message from the downstream interface in PPT, the interface cancels the Prune action.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the hello-option override-interval command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
