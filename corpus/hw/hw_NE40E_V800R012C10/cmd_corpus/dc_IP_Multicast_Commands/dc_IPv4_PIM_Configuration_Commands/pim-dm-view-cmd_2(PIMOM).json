    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a PIM-DM network, a Router deducts 1 from the TTL of a received State-Refresh message, and then sends the message to the downstream device. When the TTL is decreased to 0, the message is not forwarded. On a small-scale network, State-Refresh messages are transmitted circularly. You can modify the TTL according to the network scale by running the state-refresh-ttl command.\nPrecautions\nThe command applies only to routers directly connected to the source."
