To forward the multicast traffic to the right target on the leaf node of the tunnel, run the traffic select p2mp-te command to direct the multicast traffic out of a specified tunnel.\nPrecautions\nThe traffic select p2mp-te command can be only used to direct multicast traffic out of P2MP TE tunnel.The traffic select p2mp-te command cannot be deployed in a private network."
