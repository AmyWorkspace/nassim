    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run this command to set the neighbor timeout period carried in PIM Hello packets to be sent by a router. If the receive end does not receive any Hello packet from the local device within the timeout period, the receive end considers that the local neighbor is aged. If you want a router to quickly sense the changes of PIM neighbors, set a smaller value for the interval parameter, but the interval value is larger than the interval at which PIM neighbors send Hello messages.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the pim hello-option holdtime command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
