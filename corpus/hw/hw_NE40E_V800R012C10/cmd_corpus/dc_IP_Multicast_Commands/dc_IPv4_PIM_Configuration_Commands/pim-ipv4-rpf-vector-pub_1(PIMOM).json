    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a Huawei device uses the vendor-specific format to encapsulate Hello and Join/Prune messages that carry the vector attribute but its interworking non-Huawei device uses the standard format to encapsulate such messages, the two devices fail to communicate. To prevent this issue, run the rpf-vector compatible standard command to configure the Huawei device to use the standard format to encapsulate Hello and Join/Prune messages that carry the vector attribute\nPrerequisites\nThe function to enable Hello and Join/Prune messages to carry the vector attribute has been enabled."
