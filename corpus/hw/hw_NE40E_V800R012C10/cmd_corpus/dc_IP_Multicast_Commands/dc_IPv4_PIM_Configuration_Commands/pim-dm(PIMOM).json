    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nA multicast network requires multicast protocols, and PIM is the most widely used intra-domain multicast protocol. PIM-DM is one of the implementations of PIM. PIM-DM resolves the problem of P2MP transmission on a small-scale network with many users.\nOn a PIM-DM network, the pim dm command must be run to enable PIM-DM. Only a Router with PIM-DM enabled can set up PIM neighbor relationships with neighboring devices and process protocol packets received from them.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nMulticast routing has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command.\n\nPrecautions\n\nInterfaces belonging to the same instance on a Router must have the same PIM mode. When a router is deployed in a PIM-DM domain, it is advised to enable PIM-DM on all non-boundary interfaces.\nMulticast must be disabled if you want to switch between the PIM-DM and PIM-SM modes. After the switch is completed, re-enable multicast.\nOnly tunnel interfaces with an encapsulation mode of GRE support this command.\nPIM-DM cannot be deployed with:\n\nPublic network of the Rosen MVPN\nInterfaces bound to VPNs\nInstances where PIM-SM has been configured\nBIDIR-PIM\nPIM IPsec\nLoad balancing\nDR switch delay\nPIM Silent\nNeighbor filtering\nMulticast source filtering\nNetworks with both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services\nSSM-Policy\nThe multicast replication mode for forwarding BUM packets on NVE interface.\n\nIf you run the undo pim dm command on an interface, PIM neighbor and protocol status information on the interface will be removed. This operation will adversely affect multicast services currently running on the interface."
