    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the source's DR receives multicast data, it sends Register messages to the RP, and add registered egress interface. If too many redundant Register messages are sent to RP, the performance is affected. Run the register-with-probe command to disable Register messages sending function on the source's DR, the DR sends Probe messages instead of Register messages, so that the performance is not affected."
