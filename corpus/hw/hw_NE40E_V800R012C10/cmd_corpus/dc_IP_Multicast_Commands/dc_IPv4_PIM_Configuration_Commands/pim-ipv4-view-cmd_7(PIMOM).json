    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo implement data flow control and limit information that downstream receivers can obtain, run the source-policy command to configure a policy using which the Router filters received multicast data packets based on source addresses or based on source and group addresses. The Router forwards a received multicast data packet only if it is permitted by an ACL rule defined in the filter policy, thus improving system security.\nThe source-policy command configuration also applies to multicast data packets encapsulated in Register messages.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the source-policy command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nIf a basic ACL is configured, the Router forwards only multicast data packets whose source addresses are permitted by rules of the ACL.If an advance ACL is configured, the Router forwards only multicast data packets whose source and group addresses are both permitted by rules of the ACL.If the specified ACL does not exist, the Router discards all multicast data packets."
