    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf dual feed and selective receiving is needed to improve fault convergence performance in multicast service scenarios, multicast source cloning-based PIM FRR can be deployed to protect services. To enable the function to clone the traffic of a multicast source, run the rpf-frr clone source command on the multicast source-side device (root PE).\nPrerequisites\nPIM FRR has been enabled using the rpf-frr command.\nPrecautions\nThe s, s1, and s2 cannot be the same.\nA source address supports a maximum of 2 cloned source addresses."
