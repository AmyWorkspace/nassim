    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, each PIM-SM domain has only one BSR to serve all routers in the entire PIM-SM domain. To implement better device management, run the c-bsr admin-scope command to enable the BSR administrative domain function, so that a PIM-SM domain can be divided into one global domain and multiple BSR administrative domains. This function can therefore reduce the workload of a single BSR and provide dedicated services for users in a specific domain using private group addresses.\nEach BSR administrative domain maintains a BSR, serving the multicast groups on the network segment 239.0.0.0/8. Multicast packets for groups on this network segment cannot go across a BSR administrative domain border. Multicast groups that do not belong to any BSR administrative domain belong to the global domain. The global domain maintains a BSR, serving all other multicast groups not on the network segment 239.0.0.0/8.\nSimilar to VPN in unicast, a BSR administrative domain can be regarded as a VPN, and the multicast address segment 239.0.0.0/8 can be regarded as the unicast address segment 10.0.0.0/8. Other multicast group addresses can be all used on the public network; therefore, address collision must be prevented. However, a same multicast group address can be assigned to different BSR administrative domains.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the undo pim command or the undo multicast routing-enable command is run in the system view, the BSR administrative domain function is automatically disabled.\nPrecautions\nTo implement the BSR administrative domain function, you must run the c-bsr admin-scope command on all routers in a PIM-SM domain."
