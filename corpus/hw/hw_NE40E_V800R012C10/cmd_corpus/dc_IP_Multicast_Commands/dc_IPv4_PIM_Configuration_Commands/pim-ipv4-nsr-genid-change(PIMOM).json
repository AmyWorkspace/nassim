    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a PIM NSR scenario, after a master/slave main control board switchover is performed on a device, associated devices do not detect the switchover and the MDT is not changed. As a result, new multicast services may not be processed. If the multicast traffic volume is small (the number of multicast entries is less than 1K) and high master/slave main control board switchover performance is required, run the hello nsr genid-change enable command on a device to change the value of Generation ID in a Hello message to be sent after the switchover. After the command is run, associated devices detect the status change of the device, reducing the duration during which new services cannot be processed during the switchover."
