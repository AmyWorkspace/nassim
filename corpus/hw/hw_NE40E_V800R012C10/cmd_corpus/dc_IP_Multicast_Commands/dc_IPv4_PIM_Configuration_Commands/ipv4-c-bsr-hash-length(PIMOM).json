    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a PIM-SM network where a rendezvous point (RP) is dynamically elected using the BSR mechanism, each candidate-rendezvous point (C-RP) sends to the BSR an Advertisement message carrying the C-RP address, range of multicast groups that the C-RP serves, and C-RP priority. Then, the BSR collects all those information and the BSR hash mask length as an RP-set, encapsulates the RP-set into a bootstrap message, and advertises the message to all Routers on the network. All Routers use the RP-set and follow the same RP election rules to elect an RP for a specific group.\nThe RP election rules are as follows:\nThe C-RP with the highest priority wins (a larger priority value indicates a lower priority).If the C-RPs have the same priority, the hash function is started. The C-RP with the largest calculated value is elected as the RP.If all C-RPs have the same priority and calculated hash value, the C-RP with the largest address wins the election.\nTo configure a global hash mask length for C-BSRs, run the c-bsr hash-length command.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the c-bsr hash-length command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
