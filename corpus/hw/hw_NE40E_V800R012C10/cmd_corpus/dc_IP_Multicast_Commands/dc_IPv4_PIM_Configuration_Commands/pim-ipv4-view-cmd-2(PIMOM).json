    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run this command to set the neighbor timeout period carried in PIM Hello packets to be sent by a router. If the receive end does not receive any Hello packet from the local device within the timeout period, the receive end considers that the local neighbor is aged. If routers need to quickly detect PIM neighbor changes, set this parameter to a smaller value, but the value must be greater than the configured interval for sending Hello messages.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the hello-option holdtime command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
