    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe display pim claimed-route command can be used to display the information about unicast routes used by PIM. The command output includes information about reverse path forwarding (RPF) neighbors, detailed interface information, route types, and route selection policies.\nPrecautions\nDifferences between the display pim claimed-route command and the display multicast rpf-info command are as follows:\nThe display multicast rpf-info command displays information about RPF neighbors, RPF interfaces, and whether there is a route to a specified source address.The display pim claimed-route command displays information about unicast routes used by multicast routing and entries of the routes.\nIf neither vpn-instance nor all-instance is specified, the command displays information about unicast routes used by PIM in the public network instance."
