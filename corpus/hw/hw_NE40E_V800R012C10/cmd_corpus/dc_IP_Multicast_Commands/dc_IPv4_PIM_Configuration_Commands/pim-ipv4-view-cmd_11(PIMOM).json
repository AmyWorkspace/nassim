    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe multicast routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nBefore using the timer spt-switch command, you must use the spt-switch-threshold command to set the rate threshold that can trigger data switching from an RPT to an SPT. Otherwise, running the timer spt-switch command is meaningless.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the timer spt-switch command is run several times, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIn an MVPN S-PMSI scenario, if the number of multicast entries in the VPN instance is more than 16K and less than 32K, run the timer spt-switch command to set the interval to 120 seconds."
