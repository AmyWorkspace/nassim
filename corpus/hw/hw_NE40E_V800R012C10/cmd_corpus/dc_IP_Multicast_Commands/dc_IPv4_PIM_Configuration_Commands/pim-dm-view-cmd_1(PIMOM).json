    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a PIM-DM network, to avoid that a pruned interface restores forwarding because the prune timer expires, the first-hop Router closest to the source periodically sends State-Refresh messages. The State-Refresh messages are flooded on the entire network to refresh the prune timers on all Routers. To configure the interval at which a Router sends State-Refresh messages, run the state-refresh-interval command.\nPrecautions\nTo prevent pruned interfaces from forwarding packets after the Prune state times out, the interval at which State-Refresh messages are sent must be shorter than the period for keeping the Prune state. Run the holdtime join-prune command to configure the period during which a Router keeps the Prune state."
