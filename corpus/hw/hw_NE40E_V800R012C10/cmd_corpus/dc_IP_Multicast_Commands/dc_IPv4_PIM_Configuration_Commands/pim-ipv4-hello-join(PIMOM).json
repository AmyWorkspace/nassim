    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf dual feed and selective receiving is needed to improve fault convergence performance in multicast service scenarios, multicast source cloning-based PIM FRR can be deployed to protect services. Multicast source cloning-based PIM FRR requires PIM Join messages to carry vector information, and PIM Join messages can carry vector information only if interfaces are enabled to send PIM Hello messages that carry the Join attribute. In this case, you can run the hello-option join-attribute enable command to enable all PIM interfaces to send PIM Hello messages that carry the Join attribute."
