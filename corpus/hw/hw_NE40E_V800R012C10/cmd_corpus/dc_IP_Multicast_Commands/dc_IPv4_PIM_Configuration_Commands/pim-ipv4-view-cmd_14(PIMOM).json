    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA Router on a PIM-SM network needs to send Hello messages periodically to maintain PIM neighbor relationships. To set the interval at which PIM interfaces send Hello messages, run the timer hello command. To have a Router rapidly sense PIM neighbor changes, set a Hello packet sending interval smaller than the configured neighbor timeout period.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the timer hello command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nThe timer hello command can be run in the PIM view of a VPN instance to change the interval for sending Hello messages on all interfaces of the VPN instance."
