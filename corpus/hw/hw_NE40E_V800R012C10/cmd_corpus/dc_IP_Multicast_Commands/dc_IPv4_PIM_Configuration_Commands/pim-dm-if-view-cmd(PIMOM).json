    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nThe PIM-DM status is refreshed based on Status-Refresh messages periodically sent on the network. Upon receipt of a Status-Refresh message, a Router in the Prune state resets the Prune status timer. This implementation prevents the downstream interfaces from forwarding data when the timer expires.\nWhen Status-Refresh is disabled, interfaces start to forward multicast data when the Prune timer expires. The downstream Router that rejects the data then sends Prune messages. However, this process repeats itself periodically, occupying a lot of network resources. It is advised to enable Status-Refresh, because this allows you to save network resources. If all users receive multicast data, State-Refresh can be disabled.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nMulticast has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command.\n\nPrecautions\n\nThe pim state-refresh-capable command does not apply to interfaces bound to VPNs.\nThe common tunnel interface does not support the refreshing of the PIM-DM status. Only the GRE Tunnel interface supports the PIM-DM state refresh function."
