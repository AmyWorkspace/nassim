    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nHello messages sent by routers carry lan-delay and override-interval. lan-delay indicates the delay in transmitting messages in the LAN. When the values of lan-delay on all routers on the same link are different, the maximum value of these values is used.\nIf a router receives a Prune message from the upstream interface, it indicates that other downstream routers still exist in the LAN. If the router still needs to receive multicast data, it must send a Join message to the upstream interface in the override-interval period.\nWhen receiving a Prune message from a downstream interface, the router does not perform the prune action immediately until the Prune-Pending Timer (PPT) times out. The PPT equals the value of the lan-delay plus the override-interval. If the router receives a Join message from the downstream interface in PPT, the router cancels the prune action.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing-enable command is run in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the pim hello-option lan-delay command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
