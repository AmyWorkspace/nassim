    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA router on a PIM-SM network needs to send Hello messages periodically to maintain PIM neighbor relationships. To set the interval at which an interface sends Hello messages, run the pim timer hello command.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the pim timer hello command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThe interval at which an interface sends Hello messages must be shorter than the timeout period of PIM neighbors."
