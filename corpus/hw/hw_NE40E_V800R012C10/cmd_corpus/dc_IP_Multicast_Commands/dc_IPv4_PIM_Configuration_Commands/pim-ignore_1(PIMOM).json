    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a VRRP backup group for multicast services, if the interfaces on both the master and a backup device are Up, RBS hot backup is not required, and a Layer 2 device learns both of the interfaces as router interfaces and sends protocol packets to the master and backup devices. However, in Layer 3 multicast, PIM outbound interfaces are generated by the PIM DR, and each network segment can have only one PIM DR. To allow non-DRs to generate outbound interfaces in such a scenario, run the pim ignore dr-state command to enable an interface to ignore the PIM DR state.\nPrerequisites\nPIM has been enabled using the pim command."
