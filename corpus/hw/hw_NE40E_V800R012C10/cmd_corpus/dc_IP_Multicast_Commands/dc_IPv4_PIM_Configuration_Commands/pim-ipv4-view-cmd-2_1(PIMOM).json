    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter receiving a Join/Prune message from a downstream interface, an upstream router determines the time period for keeping the join or prune state of a downstream interface based on the holdtime field carried in the Join/Prune message. To set a value for the holdtime field, run the holdtime join-prune command. Generally, the holdtime is 3.5 times the interval (specified using the timer join-prune command) at which Join/Prune messages are sent.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the holdtime join-prune command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
