    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter receiving a Register-Stop message, the source's designated router (DR) stops sending Register messages and enters the register suppression state. During register suppression, the source's DR sends Probe messages to notify the RP that the multicast source is still in the Active state. After register suppression times out, the source's DR starts to send Register messages. To set the interval at which Probe messages are sent to the RP, run the probe-interval command.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the probe-interval command is run several times, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
