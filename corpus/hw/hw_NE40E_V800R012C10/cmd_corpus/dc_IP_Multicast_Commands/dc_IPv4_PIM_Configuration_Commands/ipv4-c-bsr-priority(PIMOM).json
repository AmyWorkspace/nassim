    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf multiple C-BSRs are deployed in a PIM-SM domain, a BSR is elected based on the following rules:\nThe C-BSR with the highest priority wins.If the C-BSRs have the same priority, the C-BSR with the largest IP address wins.\nTo have a C-BSR be elected as the BSR, run the c-bsr priority command to set a larger priority value for the C-BSR than those of the other C-BSRs.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the c-bsr priority command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
