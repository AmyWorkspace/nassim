    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn IGP ECMP-based or non-ECMP-based PIM FRR scenarios, IGP route changes will trigger frequent PIM backup inbound interface switchovers, causing frequent master/backup forwarding entry switchovers on the forwarding plane. As a result, the rapid convergence function of PIM FRR is adversely affected. To resolve this issue, run the backup-rpf-switchover-delay flow-based command to delay forwarding entry generation on new interfaces connected to backup upstream devices.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the backup-rpf-switchover-delay flow-based command is run for more than one, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
