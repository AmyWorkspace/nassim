    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a PIM-DM Network, it is possible for a Router to receive State-Refresh messages from more than one Router. Some of these messages are duplicate. Upon the receipt of the first State-Refresh message, a Router with the state-refresh-rate-limit command configured immediately resets the Prune timer and starts the State-Refresh timer. The lifetime of the State-Refresh timer is equal to the time that the Router has to wait before receiving the next State-Refresh message.\nBefore the State-Refresh timer expires, the Router discards the State-Refresh messages it receives.After the State-Refresh timer expires, the Router is allowed to receive the next State-Refresh message."
