    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the interval at which a PIM interface sends Join/Prune messages upstream, run the pim timer join-prune command. The interval at which a PIM interface sends Join/Prune messages upstream must be shorter than the holdtime of Join/Prune messages.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the pim timer join-prune command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
