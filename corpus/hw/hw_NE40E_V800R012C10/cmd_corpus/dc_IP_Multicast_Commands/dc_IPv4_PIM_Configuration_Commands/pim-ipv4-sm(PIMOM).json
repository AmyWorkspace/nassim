    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEnabling PIM-SM on an interface is the prerequisite for the interface to set up PIM neighbor relationships with other Routers and to process PIM messages. To enable PIM-SM on an interface, run the pim sm command.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nPrecautions\nThis command does not apply to MTunnel interfaces.The pim sm command is mutually exclusive with the pim dm command.Running the undo pim sm command deletes the PIM-SM configuration from an interface, which interrupts PIM services. Therefore, exercise caution when using this command.This command applies only to the view of a tunnel interface with an encapsulation mode of GRE or TE."
