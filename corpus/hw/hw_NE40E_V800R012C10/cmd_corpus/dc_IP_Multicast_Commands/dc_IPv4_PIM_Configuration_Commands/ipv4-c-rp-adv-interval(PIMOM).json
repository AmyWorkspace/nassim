    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAll C-RPs in a PIM-SM domain send Advertisement messages to the same bootstrap router (BSR). An Advertisement message carries the C-RP address, range of multicast groups that the C-RP serves, and priority of the C-RP. In this manner, the BSR can collect complete RP-set information. To set an interval at which a C-RP sends an Advertisement message, run the c-rp advertisement-interval command.\nPrerequisites\nThe multicast routing function has been enabled using the multicast routing-enable command in the public network instance view or VPN instance view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the c-rp advertisement-interval command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
