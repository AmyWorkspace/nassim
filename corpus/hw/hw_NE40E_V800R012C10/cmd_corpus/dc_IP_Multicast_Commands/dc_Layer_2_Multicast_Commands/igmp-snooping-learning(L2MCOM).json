    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter you run the igmp-snooping learning vlan command to enable an interface dynamically to learn forwarding entries, the interface can both be added to a multicast group statically and learn forwarding entries dynamically based on received IGMP Report messages. After the interface is disabled from dynamically learning forwarding entries, you can only add the interface to a multicast group statically.If the igmp-snooping learning vlan command is run more than once, all configurations take effect."
