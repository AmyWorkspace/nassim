    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRouter-Alert is a mechanism used to identify protocol messages. Messages carrying the Router-Alert option are delivered to the routing protocol layer for processing.\nBy default, devices do not check whether messages carry Router-Alert options for the sake of compatibility, and send all MLD messages to the upper layer for processing. To improve device performance, reduce costs, and ensure protocol security, run the mld-snooping require-router-alert command to configure a device to discard MLD messages that do not carry Router-Alert options. After the command is run, the device checks whether a received MLD message carries the Router-Alert option and discards the message if it does not carry the Router-Alert option.\nPrerequisites\nMLD snooping has been enabled using the mld-snooping enable command.\nPrecautions\nThe\nmld-snooping require-router-alert command fails to be run in a VLAN view in any of the following conditions:\nThe VLAN is bound to a VSI.\nThe\nmld-snooping require-router-alert command configuration in a VSI view fails in any of the following conditions:\nThe VSI is bound to a BD."
