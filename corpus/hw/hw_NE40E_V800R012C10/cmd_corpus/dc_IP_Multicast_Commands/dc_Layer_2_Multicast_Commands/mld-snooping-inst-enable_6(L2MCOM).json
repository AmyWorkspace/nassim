    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe mld-snooping robust-count command provides the following functions:\nAdjusts the number of group-specific Query messages to be sent by a querier, preventing messages loss on a network.\nWhen receiving an MLD Done message of a multicast group, the device sends group-specific Query messages for times to check whether there are any other members in this group. Run the mld-snooping lastmember-queryinterval command to set the interval at which group-specific Query messages are sent.\nChanges the aging time of member interfaces.\nAfter receiving a Report messages from a downstream host, the device sets the aging time of the member interface using the following formula: Member interface aging time = Number of group-specific Query messages to be sent x Interval at which general Query messages are sent + Maximum time for the querier to wait for responses from downstream hosts. By default, the device sets the aging time to 130s. Run the mld-snooping query-interval command to set the interval at which general Query messages are sent, and run the mld-snooping max-response-time command to set the maximum time for the querier to wait for responses from downstream hosts.\nAfter receiving a Done message, the device sets the aging time of the member interface using the following formula: Member interface aging time = Interval at which group-specific Query messages are sent x Number of group-specific Query messages to be sent. By default, the device sets the aging time to 2s. Run the mld-snooping robust-count command to set the number of group-specific Query messages to be sent, and run the mld-snooping lastmember-queryinterval command to set the interval at which group-specific Query messages are sent.\nIf the querier receives a Report message for the multicast group from another host within the robust-count x lastmember-queryinterval period, it continues to maintain the member interface information for the group. If the querier does not receive a Report message for the multicast group within this period, the querier considers that there is no member of the group on the network segment, and does not maintain the member interface information for the group.\n\nPrerequisites\nMLD snooping has been enabled using the mld-snooping enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the mld-snooping robust-count command is run more than once in the same view, the latest configuration overwrites the previous one.\nPrecautions\nTo use the mld-snooping robust-count configuration as a factor of adjusting the member interface aging time, set the same number of group-specific Query messages to be sent as that specified on its upstream device. Otherwise, multicast data transmission will be interrupted between the Layer 2 and Layer 3 devices.\nThe\nmld-snooping robust-count command fails to be run in a VLAN view in any of the following conditions:\nThe VLAN is bound to a VSI.\nThe\nmld-snooping robust-count command fails to be run in a VSI view in the following condition:\nThe VSI is bound to a BD."
