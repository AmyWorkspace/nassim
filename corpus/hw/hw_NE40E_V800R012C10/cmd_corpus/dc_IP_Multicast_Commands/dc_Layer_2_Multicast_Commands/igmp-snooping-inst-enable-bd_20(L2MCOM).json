    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve multicast service deployment security, configure a policy to filter out IGMP Report or Leave messages sent by specific hosts.\nIf a basic ACL is specified in the igmp-snooping ip-policy command, IGMP Report or Leave messages with specified source IP addresses are accepted or rejected. If an advanced ACL is specified in this command, IGMP Report or Leave messages with specified source and destination IP addresses are accepted or rejected.\nPrerequisites\nIGMP snooping has been enabled globally."
