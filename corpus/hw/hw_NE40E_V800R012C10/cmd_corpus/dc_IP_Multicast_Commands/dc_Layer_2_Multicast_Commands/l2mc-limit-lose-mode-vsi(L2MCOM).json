    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a bandwidth limit is configured for each member interface of an Eth-Trunk interface using the l2-multicast limit per-trunk-member bandwidth command in the Eth-Trunk interface view, the total bandwidth limit increases each time a new interface is added to the Eth-Trunk interface. If a member interface fails, multicast traffic on this member interface will be balanced by other Up member interfaces. Such a traffic transfer may cause the required bandwidth to exceed the upper limit on some member interfaces. If such a problem occurs on an Up member interface, original multicast traffic on this member interface may be interrupted. To prevent this problem, run the l2-multicast limit dynamic-trunk-bandwidth lose-mode command to enable the device to delete some Layer 2 multicast information of Down Eth-Trunk member interfaces when the required bandwidth on Up Eth-Trunk member interfaces exceeds the upper limit.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the l2-multicast limit dynamic-trunk-bandwidth lose-mode command is run, the device deletes some Layer 2 multicast information of Down Eth-Trunk member interfaces when the required bandwidth on Up Eth-Trunk member interfaces exceeds the upper limit.\nIf the l2-multicast limit dynamic-trunk-bandwidth lose-mode command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThe l2-multicast limit dynamic-trunk-bandwidth lose-mode command configuration takes effect only if the l2-multicast limit per-trunk-member bandwidth command is configured."
