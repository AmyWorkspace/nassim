    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an upstream Layer 3 multicast device is a non-Huawei device and static groups are configured on the device, the device does not allow dynamic group join or leave. In this scenario, run the mld-snooping static-group suppress-dynamic-join command on the Layer 2 device to disable interfaces in a VLAN/VSI from forwarding Report and Done messages to the upstream router.\nPrerequisites\nMLD snooping has been enabled globally and in the VSI view.\nPrecautions\nThe\nmld-snooping static-group suppress-dynamic-join command fails to be run in a VSI view in the following condition:\nThe VSI is bound to a BD."
