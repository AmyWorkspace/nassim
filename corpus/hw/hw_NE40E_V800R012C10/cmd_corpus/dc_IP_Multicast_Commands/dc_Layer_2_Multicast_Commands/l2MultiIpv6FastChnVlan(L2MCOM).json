    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter receiving the first MLD Report for a multicast group, the device needs to apply for resources for this group and then generates a forwarding entry. This decreases the speed at which hosts join the multicast group. To speed up host join, run the l2-multicast ipv6 fast-channel command to enable prompt join. With this function enabled, the device applies for resources for multicast groups in advance. When the device receives an MLD Report message for a multicast group, it can immediately forward multicast data for the multicast group, shortening the delay for the device to respond to the Report message.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the device has reserved resources for a multicast group but does not receive an MLD Report message for this multicast group for a long period of time, resources will be wasted and device performance will be degraded."
