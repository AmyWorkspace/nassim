    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a multicast source no longer sends multicast data traffic, the source needs to be deleted. This requires constant probes on whether the source sends multicast data flows. To address this problem, the l2-multicast source-lifetime command can be used to set the aging time for entries triggered by multicast traffic based on system performance."
