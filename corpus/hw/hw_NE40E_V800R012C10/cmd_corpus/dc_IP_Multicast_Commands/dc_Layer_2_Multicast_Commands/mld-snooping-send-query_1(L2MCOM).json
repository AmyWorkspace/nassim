    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the topology of a Layer 2 ring network changes, interfaces in a relevant VLAN/VSI will receive a link change event. After the mld-snooping send-query source-address command is run on a device on the ring network, the device will send MLD general Query messages with the default source address FE80:: to all non-router interfaces in the VLAN/VSI, so that the other devices can quickly update router interface information.\nIf FE80:: is being used by other devices, run the mld-snooping send-query source-address command to set a new source IP address for MLD General Query messages."
