    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the upstream Layer 3 multicast device is a non-Huawei device and a static group is configured on its interface connected to a Layer 2 device, hosts cannot dynamically join or leave multicast groups. The igmp-snooping static-group suppress-dynamic-join command must be used to disable the Layer 2 device from sending Report or Leave messages to the Layer 3 device.\nPrerequisites\nIGMP snooping has been configured globally and in a VLAN/BD."
