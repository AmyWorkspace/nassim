    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo check statistics about global multicast groups in all Layer 2 multicast VSIs, run the display l2-multicast all-vsi global entry-number command.\nPrecautions\nThe command has a delay in displaying data because of sampling. The maximum delay is 10 seconds for statistics in the last 5 minutes, 5 minutes for statistics in the last 15 minutes, and 1 hour for statistics in the last 24 hours. After a master/slave board switchover, the data changes on the master and slave boards are different. As a result, the displayed content is different."
