    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a network provides services for multiple content providers, you can group a service provider's all multicast groups into one or more channels for management convenience. Then, you can configure tailored service rules for different content providers, including limiting the bandwidth to a specific value for multicast groups in a specific or all channels on a sub-interface.\nDuring IPTV service deployment, if users demand a large number of channels, required bandwidth resources may exceed the total bandwidth resources of the aggregation network, overloading aggregation devices and deteriorating user experience. To resolve these issues, run the l2-multicast limit channel bandwidth command to limit the bandwidth to a specific value for a dot1q termination sub-interface.\nPrerequisites\nA sub-interface has been configured as a dot1q termination sub-interface, and the sub-interface has been bound to an LDP-based VSI."
