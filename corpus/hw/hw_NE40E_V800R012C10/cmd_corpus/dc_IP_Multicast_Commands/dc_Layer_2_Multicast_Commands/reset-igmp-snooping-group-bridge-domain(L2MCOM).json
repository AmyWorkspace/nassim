    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the command is used to clear the dynamic forwarding entries in a certain BD, the multicast traffic received by hosts in the BD is interrupted until the hosts send IGMP Report messages again. After receiving the IGMP Report messages, the Router regenerates the forwarding entries and the hosts start to receive the multicast traffic again.\nIf the BD is bound to a VSI, the system does not prompt error information when the reset igmp-snooping group bridge-domain all command is run."
