    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allow only data for defined groups in a global or VSI channel to pass through, run the unspecified-channel deny command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter receiving a message for a multicast group that is beyond the range allowed by a channel, a device configured with the unspecified-channel deny command does not create any forwarding entry for this group.\nPrecautions\nExisting forwarding entries on a device will not be deleted after the unspecified-channel deny command is run on the device. After these entries age out, no entry will be created for groups beyond the range allowed by the channel."
