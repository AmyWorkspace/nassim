    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf hosts connected to an interface need to regularly receive data for a multicast group or a source-specific multicast group, the l2-multicast static-group command can be used to configure the interface as a static member interface.\nStatic member interfaces can be configured on different positions on a network to enable users to receive data for specific multicast groups or source-specific multicast groups regularly.\nPrerequisites\nIGMP snooping has been configured globally and in a BD.\nConfiguration Impact\nA static member interface does not respond to IGMP Query messages. After the undo l2-multicast static-group command is run on a static member interface, the interface does not initiate an IGMP Leave message.\nIf the l2-multicast static-group command is run more than once, all configurations take effect.\nPrecautions\nIf the number of (S, G) entries relevant to a group has reached the maximum value (128), no static entry will be created after the l2-multicast static-group command is run. This means that no entry relevant to a static multicast group will be generated even after the reset igmp-snooping group all command is run in the system view to refresh entries."
