    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIGMP snooping runs on a Layer 2 device that is deployed between a Layer 3 device and user hosts. It maintains multicast forwarding entries by listening to multicast protocol packets transmitted between the upstream device and hosts, thereby controlling multicast data packet forwarding. Enabling IGMP snooping is the prerequisite for implementing Layer 2 multicast. The igmp-snooping enable command can be used to enable IGMP snooping.\nThe differences between the command configuration in the system view and that in the VLAN/VSI/BD view are listed as follows:\nAfter the igmp-snooping enable or undo igmp-snooping enable command is run in the system view, IGMP snooping will be enabled or disabled globally.After the igmp-snooping enable or undo igmp-snooping enable command is run in the VLAN/VSI/BD view, IGMP snooping will be enabled or disabled in a specified VLAN/VSI/BD. IGMP snooping can be enabled in a VLAN/VSI/BD only after IGMP snooping is enabled globally. By default, IGMP snooping is still disabled in a VLAN/VSI/BD though IGMP snooping is enabled in the system view.\n\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo igmp snooping enable command deletes all Layer 2 multicast commands on a device. The running Layer 2 multicast services are then terminated. Exercise caution when performing this operation."
