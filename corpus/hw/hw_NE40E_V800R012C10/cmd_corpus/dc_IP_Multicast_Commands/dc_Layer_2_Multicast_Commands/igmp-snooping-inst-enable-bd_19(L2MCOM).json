    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThere are two multicast group models: any-source multicast (ASM) and source-specific multicast (SSM). The igmp-snooping command can be used to configure a device to forward data only for multicast groups of the ASM or SSM model in a BD.\nPrerequisites\nThe igmp-snooping enable command has been run to enable IGMP snooping globally and in a BD.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf asm-only is specified in the igmp-snooping command, only (*, G) messages are processed, and other packets are discarded."
