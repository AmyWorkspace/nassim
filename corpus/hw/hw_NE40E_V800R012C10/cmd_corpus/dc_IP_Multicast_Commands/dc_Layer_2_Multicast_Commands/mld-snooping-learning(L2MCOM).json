    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable an interface to dynamically learn forwarding entries in MLD Report messages received, run the mld-snooping learning command. After this command is run for an interface, the interface can be added to a multicast group manually. However, after the undo mld-snooping learning command is run for an interface, the interface cannot dynamically learn forwarding entries, but can still be added to a multicast group manually.\nIf the undo mld-snooping learning command is run more than once, all configurations take effect."
