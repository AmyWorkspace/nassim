    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the querier function is enabled on multiple devices in a BD, the igmp-snooping querier-election command can be used to elect the device with the lowest IP address as the querier. Then the device replaces the connected upstream device to send Query messages to user hosts. You can run the igmp-snooping send-query source-address command to configure a source IP address to be carried by an IGMP Query message. By default, the source IP address carried by an IGMP Query message is 192.168.0.1.\nPrerequisites\nThe igmp-snooping querier enable command has been run to enable the querier function in the BD."
