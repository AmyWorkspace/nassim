    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a Layer 2 multicast device does need to forward PIM messages to its connected non-multicast devices, run the l2-multicast pim router-port command, so that the Layer 2 multicast device forwards PIM messages only to router interfaces. This configuration frees the connected non-multicast devices from processing PIM messages, reducing message forwarding and processing workloads and bandwidth consumption.\nPrerequisites\nIGMP snooping has been enabled using the igmp-snooping enable command in the system view and then in the VLAN or VSI view."
