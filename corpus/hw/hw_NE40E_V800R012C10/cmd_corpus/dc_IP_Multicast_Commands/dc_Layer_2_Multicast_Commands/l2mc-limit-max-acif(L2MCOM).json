    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIf multicast packets are used to attack the network, devices on the network will be busy processing attack packets and cannot respond to normal network requests. To ensure the multicast service quality, you can configure a multicast group number limit to control generated multicast forwarding entries.\nTable 1 lists the principles for command parameter selection.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nIf the l2-multicast limit max-entry command is run more than once, all configurations take effect.\n\nPrecautions\n\nWhen using ACL rules for filtering, note the following points:\n\nBasic ACL: (*, G) entry-based filtering rules are used. The source address specified in an ACL is G (multicast group address) in a (*, G) entry.\nAdvanced ACL:\nIn the Any-Source Multicast (ASM) model, (*, G) entry-based filtering rules are used. The source address specified in an ACL is G (multicast group address) in a (*, G) entry.\nIn the Source Specific Multicast Mapping (SSM) model, (S, G) entry-based filtering rules are used. The source address specified in an ACL is S (multicast source address) in an (S, G) entry and the destination address specified in the ACL is G (multicast group address) in the (S, G) entry."
