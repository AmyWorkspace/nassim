    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the querier function is enabled on a Layer 2 device, this device will replace its upstream device to send IGMP Query messages, and will be able to create and maintain multicast forwarding entries at the data link layer, implementing multicast data forwarding.\nThe following conditions must be met before the igmp-snooping querier enable command is run:\nThe querier function is configured on a device only after a static multicast group is configured on the connected upstream device. Otherwise, Report messages sent by user hosts cannot be sent to the upstream device. As a result, these user hosts cannot receive required multicast data.If the paths from a multicast source to user hosts are in the same Layer 2 network, the querier function can be enabled on a Layer 2 device. This does not affect the normal receiving of multicast data packets."
