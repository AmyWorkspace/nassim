    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a device enabled with IGMP snooping, the interfaces receive any IGMP general query messages with the source IP addresses other than 0.0.0.0 or Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Hello packets are considered as dynamic router ports. The device records all router ports in a router port list. Receiving multicast data through router ports causes multicast data available to users to be uncontrollable. To control the multicast data available to users, you can disable dynamic router port learning.\nPrerequisites\nIGMP snooping has been enabled both globally and in a VLAN.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter dynamic router port learning is disabled, no interface will listen to IGMP Query messages, and static router ports must be configured.\nPrecautions\nIf the multicast VLAN function has been enabled on a device, disabling dynamic router port learning is not allowed in any user VLAN configured on the device.\nIf a sub-interface in a VLAN has been bound to a VSI, IGMP snooping must be enabled in the VSI.\nThe igmp-snooping router-learning command fails to be run in a VLAN in either of the following situations:\nA Dot1q termination sub-interface has been added to the VLAN.The VLAN has a VE interface."
