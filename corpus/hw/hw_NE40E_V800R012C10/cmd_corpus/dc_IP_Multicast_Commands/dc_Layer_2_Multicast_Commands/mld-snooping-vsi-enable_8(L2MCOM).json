    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNetwork congestion may delay the transmission of a Query message from an MLD Querier. If a dynamic router interface does not receive any MLD Query message with source IP addresses other than 0::0 or PIM hello message within the aging time, it becomes a non-router interface. The device will then not send Report or Done messages to the interface. This may lead to multicast data transmission interruption. Therefore, if a network is unstable, run the mld-snooping router-aging-time command to set larger aging time for dynamic router interfaces. The device resets the aging time of a dynamic router interface when the interface receives an MLD Query or PIM Hello message from the interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the remaining aging time of a dynamic router interface is less than router-aging-time, the device sets the aging time of the dynamic router port to router-aging-time, irrespective of whether the device receives a PIM Hello messages or MLD Query message from the interface.\nPrecautions\nThe\nmld-snooping router-aging-time command fails to be run in a VSI view in the following condition:\nThe VSI is bound to a BD."
