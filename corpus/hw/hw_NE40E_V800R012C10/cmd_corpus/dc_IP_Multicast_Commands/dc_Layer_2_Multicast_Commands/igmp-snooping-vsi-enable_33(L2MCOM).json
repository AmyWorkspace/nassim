    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe igmp-snooping max-response-time command has the following functions:\nSets the maximum response time to control the deadline for hosts to send IGMP Report messages.\nIf the querier function is enabled, set a short maximum response time to enable hosts to rapidly respond to IGMP Query messages, and set a long maximum response time to prevent traffic congestion caused by too many Report or Leave messages sent by hosts on a network.\nCheck that the interval at which IGMP general query messages are sent is greater than the maximum response time for a downstream host to respond to the querier; otherwise, multicast group members may be deleted mistakenly.\nChanges the aging time of member ports.\nAfter receiving a Report message from a downstream device, a device sets the aging time of the corresponding member port based on the following formula: Aging time of a member port = Number of times group-specific query messages are sent x Interval at which general query messages are sent + Maximum time for a downstream host to respond to a querier. The default aging time is 130s. The maximum time for a downstream host to respond to a querier is set using the igmp-snooping max-response-time command. The number of times group-specific group query messages are sent is set using the igmp-snooping robust-count command. The interval at which general query messages are sent is set using the igmp-snooping query-interval command.\n\nPrerequisites\nIGMP snooping has been configured using the igmp-snooping enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the igmp-snooping max-response-time command is run in the same view several times, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nWhen the igmp-snooping max-response-time command is used to set the aging time of member ports, the settings of parameters in this command must be consistent on a Layer 2 device and its upstream Layer 3 device; otherwise, multicast data transmission between Layer 2 and Layer 3 networks will be interrupted."
