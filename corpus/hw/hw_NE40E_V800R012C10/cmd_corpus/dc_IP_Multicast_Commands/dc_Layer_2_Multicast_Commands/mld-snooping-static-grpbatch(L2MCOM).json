    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf hosts need to regularly receive the data of a multicast group (including source-specific group) on an interface, run the l2-multicast ipv6 static-group command to configure the interface as a static member interface of the multicast group.\nStatic member interfaces can be configured on different positions on a network to enable users to receive data for multicast groups regularly. Run one or more of the following commands listed in Table 1.\nPrerequisites\nMLD snooping has been enabled globally and in the VLAN/VSI view.\nConfiguration Impact\nA static member interface does not respond to MLD Query messages. After the undo l2-multicast ipv6 static-group command is run on a static member interface, the interface does not initiate MLD Done messages any more.\nIf the l2-multicast ipv6 static-group command is run more than once, all configurations take effect.\nPrecautions\nIf the number of (S, G) entries of a group has reached the maximum value (128), no static entry will be created after the l2-multicast ipv6 static-group command is run. No entry containing this group address will be generated even after the reset mld-snooping group all command is run in the system view to refresh entries."
