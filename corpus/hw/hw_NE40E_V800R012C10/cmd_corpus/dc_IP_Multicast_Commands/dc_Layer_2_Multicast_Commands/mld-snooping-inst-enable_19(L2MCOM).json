    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBased on whether multicast messages carry source addresses, multicast messages are categorized as ASM and SSM messages. To configure the type of multicast message that the device can process in a VLAN, run the mld-snooping command.\nPrerequisites\nMLD snooping has been enabled both globally and in the VLAN view using the mld-snooping enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf asm-only is specified, only (*, G) messages are processed, and other messages are discarded.\nIf ssm-only is specified, only (S, G) messages are processed, and other packets are discarded.\nPrecautions\nThe mld-snooping command applies only to MLDv2."
