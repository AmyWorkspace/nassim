    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNetwork congestion may delay the transmission of a Query message from an IGMP Querier to a device. If a router port does not receive any IGMP Query message with source IP addresses other than 0.0.0.0 or PIM Hello packet within the aging time, it becomes a non-router port. If a dynamic router port ages before the Query message reaches a device, the device no longer sends Report or Leave messages upstream from this interface. This may lead to interruption of multicast data transmission. Therefore, if a network is instable, a larger aging time value is recommended for a dynamic router port. The device resets the aging time of a dynamic router port when the port receives an IGMP Query or PIM Hello message.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe aging time of the router port is set to the value configured using the igmp-snooping router-aging-time command, if the current remaining aging time of the router port is smaller than the configured value.\nPrecautions\nThe igmp-snooping router-aging-time command fails to be run in the VLAN view when a Dot1q termination sub-interface has been added to the VLAN."
