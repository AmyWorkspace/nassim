    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a device enabled with IGMP snooping, the interfaces receive any IGMP general query messages with the source IP addresses other than 0.0.0.0 or Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Hello packets are considered as dynamic router ports. The device records all router ports in a router port list. Receiving multicast data through router ports causes multicast data available to users to be uncontrollable. To control the multicast data available to users, you can disable dynamic router port learning.\nPrerequisites\nIGMP snooping has been enabled both globally and in a VLAN/VSI/BD.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter dynamic router port learning is disabled, no interface will listen to IGMP Query messages, and static router ports must be configured."
