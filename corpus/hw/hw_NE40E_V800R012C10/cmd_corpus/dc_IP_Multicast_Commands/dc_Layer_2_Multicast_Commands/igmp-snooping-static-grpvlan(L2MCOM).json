    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf hosts connected to an interface need to regularly receive data for a multicast group or a source-specific multicast group, the l2-multicast static-group group-address vlan command can be used to configure the interface as a static member interface.\nStatic member interfaces can be configured on different positions on a network to enable users to receive data for specific multicast groups or source-specific multicast groups regularly. The commands listed in the following table can be run in any order. Run one or more commands as required to configure static member interfaces. For details, see Table Description of the l2-multicast static-group group-address vlan command in different scenarios.\nPrerequisites\nIGMP snooping has been configured globally and in a VLAN.\nConfiguration Impact\nA static member interface does not respond to IGMP Query messages. After the undo l2-multicast static-group group-address vlan command is run on a static member interface, the interface does not initiate an IGMP Leave message.\nIf the l2-multicast static-group group-address vlan command is run more than once, all configurations take effect.\nPrecautions\nIf the number of (S, G) entries relevant to a group has reached the maximum value (128), no static entry will be created after the l2-multicast static-group group-address vlan command is run. This means that no entry relevant to a static multicast group will be generated even after the reset igmp-snooping group all command is run in the system view to refresh entries."
