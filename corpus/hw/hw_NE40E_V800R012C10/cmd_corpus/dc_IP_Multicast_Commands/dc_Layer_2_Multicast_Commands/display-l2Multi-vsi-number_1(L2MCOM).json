    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo check statistics about listened users in a specified multicast group on a specified board in a VSI, run the display l2-multicast vsi listened-user-number slot command. If you run this command to view a IGMPv2 group or an IGMPv3 group in Exclude mode, you must specify a group address and source address. wildcard is specified for the source address.\nPrecautions\nThe command has a delay in displaying data because of sampling. The maximum delay is 10 seconds for statistics in the last 5 minutes, 5 minutes for statistics in the last 15 minutes, and 1 hour for statistics in the last 24 hours. After a master/slave board switchover, the data changes on the master and slave boards are different. As a result, the displayed content is different.The command counts only the number of users who are in the valid join state. The statistics include users who sent IGMPv2 Join messages and IGMPv3 Exclude Join messages, users who sent IGMPv3 Include (S, G) Join messages, and users for whom the collision domain source information is generated in an IGMPv3 group in Include mode instead of the block source user information in an IGMPv3 group in Exclude mode or the user information in an IGMPv3 group in Include mode."
