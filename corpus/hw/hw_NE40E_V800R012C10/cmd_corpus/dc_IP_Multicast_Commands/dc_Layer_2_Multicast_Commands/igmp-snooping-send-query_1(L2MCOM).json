    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the topology of a Layer 2 ring network changes, interfaces in a relevant VLAN or VSI will receive a link change event. After the igmp-snooping send-query source-address command is run on a device on the ring network, the device will send IGMP Query messages to all non-router ports in the VLAN/VSI so that the other devices can quickly update router port information.\nIf 192.168.0.1 has been used by other devices, the igmp-snooping send-query source-address command can be used to set a new source IP address contained in IGMP Query messages sent by the IGMP snooping module."
