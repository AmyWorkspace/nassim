    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen multiple tunnel boards are bound to an LNS group, to implement tunnel load balancing based on the number of sessions on tunnel boards bound to an LNS group, run the tunnel load-balance by-session command.\nConfiguration Impact\nTunnels are preferentially established on the tunnel board that has the fewest L2TP users in the LNS group."
