    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo check connectivity of the tunnel between the LAC and LNS, the LAC and LNS send Hello packets to each other periodically and return responses when receiving the Hello packets.\nIf the LAC or LNS does not receive response to the Hello packet from the peer within a specified period, the LAC or LNS sends a Hello packet again. If the LAC or LNS does not receive the response from the peer for specified times, the LAC or LNS considers the L2TP tunnel disconnected and deletes all the sessions on the tunnel.\nYou can use the tunnel timer hello command to change the interval for sending Hello packets. LNS side and LAC side can be configured with different intervals.\nPrecautions\nwhen a specified value is smaller than the default value 60, it may cause high CPU usage and overburden the system."
