    "ExtraInfo": "To reduce the CPU usage of the network-side outbound interface board connected to an LAC, run the l2tp lns fast-reply slot command so that when a large number of L2TP users log in to an LNS, the LNS does not send user packets to the CPU for processing but directly forwards them based on hardware."
