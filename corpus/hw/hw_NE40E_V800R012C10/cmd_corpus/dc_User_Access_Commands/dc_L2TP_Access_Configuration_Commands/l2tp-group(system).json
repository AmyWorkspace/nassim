    "ExtraInfo": "The device supports 1000 L2TP groups. Apart from default-lns and default-lac, you can create 998 L2TP groups.\nThe L2TP group is important for L2TP configuration. After creating L2TP groups on the device, you can configure L2TP functions flexibly and deploy networking of one LAC to one LNS or one LAC to multiple LNSs. If an L2TP group is used to set up a tunnel, you should specify a source interface of the tunnel first.\nL2TP groups are numbered independently on the LAC and LNS. Configuration of the L2TP groups on the LAC must match the configuration of the associated L2TP groups on the LNS."
