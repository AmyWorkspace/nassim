    "FuncDef": "The bgp over lns enable command enables BGP to iterate UNR routes in L2TP user access scenarios so that the routes between devices attached to a CPE and a BRAS are reachable.\nThe undo bgp over lns enable command disables BGP from iterating UNR routes in L2TP user access scenarios.\nBy default, a CPE uses an assigned IP address to establish a BGP connection with a BRAS and traffic cannot be forwarded through the BGP route between the CPE and BRAS.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nClients R1 and R2 are attached to a CPE which is connected to an LNS through an LAC. The CPE uses L2TP dail-up to obtain an IP address from the LNS functioning as a BRAS. After the LNS learns the BGP route from the CPE, to allow the CPE and the attached devices (R1 and R2) to communicate with the LNS, run the bgp over lns enable command to enable BGP to perform UNR route recursion.\nPrerequisites\nThe IP address assigned by the BRAS to the CPE has been learned on the BRAS as the next-hop IP address of the BGP route.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to IPv4 scenarios.\nThis command is not applicable to multi-device backup scenarios."
