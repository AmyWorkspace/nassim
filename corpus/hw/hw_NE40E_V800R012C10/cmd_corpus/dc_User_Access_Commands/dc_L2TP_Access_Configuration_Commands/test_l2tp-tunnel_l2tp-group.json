    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the test l2tp-tunnel l2tp-group command is run, the local end sends packets to the destination end that is specified by the parameter ip-address , and then waits for the response from the destination end. If receiving the Reply packet within the timeout period, the local end considers that the L2TP tunnel runs normally; otherwise, the local end considers that the L2TP tunnel is faulty.\nIf the hold-time parameter is not configured, the system only tests the connection of an L2TP tunnel in the scenario where tunnel authentication is disabled on both ends.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe value of hold-time should be smaller than the idle-cut time of the L2TP tunnel on the LNS. If the LNS is configured with RADIUS remote server authentication, hold-time time should be greater than the authentication response time, and greater than 5 seconds generally."
