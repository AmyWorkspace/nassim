    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEach LNS group uses the IP address of the bound interface as the source address to communicate with the LAC. The device can determine the LNS group that processes the tunnel connection request from an LAC.\nOn the device, you can configure multiple tunnel boards and specify a tunnel board for an LNS. Multiple tunnel boards can be bound to an LNS group. These tunnel boards bear the load in turn based on tunnels.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo lns-group command fails if the LNS group has tunnels."
