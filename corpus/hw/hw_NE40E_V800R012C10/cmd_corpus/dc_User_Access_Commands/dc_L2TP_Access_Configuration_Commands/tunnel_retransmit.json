    "ExtraInfo": "After the device sends the L2TP packet to the peer through an L2TP tunnel, if no response is received within a certain time (configured through the tunnel timeout command), it resends the packet.\nIf no response is received after the number of L2TP retransmissions exceeds the value of times set in this command, the device considers that the L2TP tunnel has been broken abnormally, and clears this tunnel."
