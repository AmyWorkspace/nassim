    "ExtraInfo": "When the device functions as an LAC to interconnect with a non-Huawei device, by default, the LAC sends SCCRQ packets for tunnel establishment immediately after PPP negotiation is successful. To allow the LAC to send SCCRQ packets after a delay, run the tunnel packet sccrq send delay command."
