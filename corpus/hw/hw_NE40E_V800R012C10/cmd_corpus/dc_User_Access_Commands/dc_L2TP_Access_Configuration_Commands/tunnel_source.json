    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen initiating a tunnel connection request to the LNS, the LAC sends the source address of the local tunnel to the LNS, so that the LAC and the LNS can communicate.\nPrerequisites\nThe specified source interface must be an existing one. If the specified source interface is not configured with an IP address, the address of a directly connected interface in the local routing table is used as the source address.\nPrecautions\nThe command is valid only when a device functions as an LAC. To improve the reliability of communication between an LAC and LNS, it is recommended to configure the tunnel source command on the LAC side."
