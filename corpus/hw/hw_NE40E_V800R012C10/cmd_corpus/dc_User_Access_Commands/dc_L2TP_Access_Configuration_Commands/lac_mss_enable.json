    "ExtraInfo": "MSS refers to the maximum size of the data segment that can be transmitted each time by TCP. To implement the best transmission efficiency, TCP negotiates the MSS values of both ends before establishing the connection.\nUsually, TCP calculates an MSS value by reference to the corresponding MTU value, because MSS equals the MTU minus 40 (20 bytes of the IP header and 20 bytes of the TCP header). Therefore, if the MTU is 1500 bytes, the MSS value is 1460 bytes. Note that both ends take the smaller MSS value provided by them as the MSS value of the connection."
