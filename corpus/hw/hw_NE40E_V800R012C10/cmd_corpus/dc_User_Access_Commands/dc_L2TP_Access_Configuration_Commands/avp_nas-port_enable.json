    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable an LAC to send the NAS-Port attribute to an LNS, run the avp nas-port enable command on the LAC or the LAC-side of an LTS so that the NAS-Port attribute is carried in the AVP100 field of an ICRQ message to be sent to the LNS. To enable an LNS to parse the NAS-Port attribute carried in the AVP100 field of an ICRQ message, run the avp nas-port enable command on the LNS or the LNS-side of an LTS."
