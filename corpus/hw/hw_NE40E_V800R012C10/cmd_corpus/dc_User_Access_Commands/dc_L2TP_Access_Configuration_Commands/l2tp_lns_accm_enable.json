    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an L2TP user goes online and a device functions as an LNS, the going-online packet carries the ACCM attribute. If the value of the ACCM attribute is not zero, the user cannot go online due to an authentication failure. To allow the LCP layer on the LNS side to accept the ACCM attribute with a non-zero value, run the l2tp lns accm enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter this command is run, the user can be successfully authenticated on the LNS if the user access packet carries the ACCM attribute with a non-zero value.\nPrecautions\nAfter the l2tp lns accm enable command is run, the LCP layer on the LNS side can accept the ACCM attribute with a non-zero value, but the function of the ACCM attribute does not take effect. The l2tp lns accm enable command takes effect only on the LNS side."
