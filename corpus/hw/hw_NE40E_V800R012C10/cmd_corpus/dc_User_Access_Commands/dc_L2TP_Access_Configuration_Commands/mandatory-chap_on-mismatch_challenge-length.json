    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the device functions as an LNS and receives ICCN packets with the Challenge attribute longer than 16 bytes from an LAC, the LNS sends the packets to the RADIUS server for authentication. If the RADIUS server can only identify the Challenge attribute with 16 bytes, the authentication fails. In this case, run the mandatory-chap on-mismatch challenge-length command to configure the LNS to forcibly perform LCP reneogitation with users. Then the LNS generates the 16-byte Challenge attribute.\nPrecautions\nThis command must be run on an LNS."
