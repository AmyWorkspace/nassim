    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen multiple tunnel boards are bound to an LNS group, to implement tunnel load balancing among the tunnel boards, run the tunnel load-balance by-tunnel command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the tunnel load-balance by-tunnel command is run, tunnels are preferentially established on the tunnel board that has the fewest tunnels."
