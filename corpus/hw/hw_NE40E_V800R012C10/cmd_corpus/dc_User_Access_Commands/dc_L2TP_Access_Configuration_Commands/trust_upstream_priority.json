    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn L2TP scenarios, an LAC processes PPP packets sent from an LNS with high priority. However, downstream switches cannot process high-priority packets. To enable BA classification for PPP packets so that the packet priorities can be adjusted, run the trust upstream priority command.\nPrecautions\nThis command takes effect only on the LAC."
