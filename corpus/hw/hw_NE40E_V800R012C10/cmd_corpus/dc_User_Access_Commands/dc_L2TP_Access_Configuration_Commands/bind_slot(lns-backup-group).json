    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the scenario where 1:1 inter-board backup is configured on the L2TP LNS, run the bind slot command to bind the master and slave tunnel boards to an LNS backup group. When the master tunnel board fails, the slave tunnel board becomes the new master, improving the reliability of the network.\nPrerequisites\nAn LNS backup group has been configured using the l2tp lns backup-group command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nDuring user information backup between the master and slave tunnel boards, unbinding tunnel boards from the LNS backup group is prohibited. During switchback, unbinding the master tunnel board from the LNS backup group is prohibited, but the slave tunnel board can be unbound from the LNS backup group.\nIf both the bind slot slave command and the command for modifying a Trunk member interface are submitted at the same time, the number of users on the board may exceed the threshold, causing users to go offline or user traffic failed to be forwarded. You are advised to submit these two commands separately."
