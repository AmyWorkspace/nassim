    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable an LNS to transmit L2TP packets to an LAC by software, run the l2tp lns protocol-packet soft-transmit enable command. Software-based forwarding uses per-packet load balancing to prevent packets from arriving out of order.\nAfter an LNS is disabled from transmitting L2TP packets to an LAC by software, L2TP protocol packets are forwarded by hardware between the LNS's tunnel board and the LNS's forwarding VM connecting to an LAC.\nPrerequisites\nThe device has been configured as a LNS. The command does not take effect for non-LNS devices."
