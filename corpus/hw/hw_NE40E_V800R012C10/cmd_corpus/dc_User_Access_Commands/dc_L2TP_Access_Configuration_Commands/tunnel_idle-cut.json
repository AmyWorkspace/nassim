    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the idle-cut time of the L2TP tunnel is set to 0, it indicates that the local end will never clear the tunnel. However, if the tunnel is cleared by the peer end, the tunnel cannot be re-established any more.\nPrecautions\nIn the scenario where 1:1 inter-board backup is configured on the L2TP LNS, if a tunnel board is unbound from a backup group, the deletion of the tunnels on the tunnel board will be delayed. During the period when the deletion is delay, the tunnel idle-cut function does not take effect."
