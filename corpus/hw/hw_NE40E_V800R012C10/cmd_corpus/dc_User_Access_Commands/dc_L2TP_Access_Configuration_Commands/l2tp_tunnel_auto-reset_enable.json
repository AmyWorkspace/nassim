    "ExtraInfo": "If an LAC or LNS fails to receive a session control message (ICRP or ICCN) from the remote end of an L2TP tunnel after 127 ICRQ or ICRP messages are sent within 10 minutes, but the Hello detection messages of the tunnel can be normally sent and received, run the l2tp tunnel auto-reset enable command to enable the LAC or LNS to automatically remove an L2TP tunnel. After the tunnel is re-established, this problem can be resolved in some scenarios."
