    "ExtraInfo": "After the tunnel-alarm command is configured, if the L2TP tunnel status is changed, the device displays information about the L2TP tunnel status change, the tunnel ID, name of the tunnel remote end, and the IP address of the tunnel remote end. You are recommended to disable the tunnel alarm function when a large number of L2TP tunnels are being created, because too many trunk alarms affect the device performance."
