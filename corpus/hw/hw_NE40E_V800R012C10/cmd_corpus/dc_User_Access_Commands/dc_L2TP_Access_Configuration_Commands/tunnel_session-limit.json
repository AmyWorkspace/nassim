    "ExtraInfo": "The maximum number of sessions that users can access is determined by the relevant license. By specifying the maximum number of sessions for each tunnel, carriers can perform network deployment.\nIf the sessions for a tunnel reach the limit configured using the tunnel session-limit command in the L2TP group view, users cannot go online, and tunnels cannot be established. To allow users to continue going online through tunnels, you can run the tunnel load-sharing command in the L2TP group view to enable load balancing among tunnels."
