    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an LNS to use the authentication mode delivered by the LAC preferentially in an LCP renegotiation process, run the renegotiation-lcp authentication-mode lac first command.\nPrecautions\nThe renegotiation-lcp authentication-mode lac first command is effective only if the mandatory-lcp command is configured on an LNS. By default, an LNS does not perform LCP renegotiation.\nIf the LNS is configured to preferentially select the authentication mode delivered by the LAC, an insecure authentication mode may be selected, which poses security risks. You are advised to configure the LNS to use the secure authentication mode configured in the local virtual template view."
