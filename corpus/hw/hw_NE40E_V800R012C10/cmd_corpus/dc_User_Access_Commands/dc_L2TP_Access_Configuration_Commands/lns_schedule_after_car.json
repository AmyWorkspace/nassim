    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a scenario where L2TP users enter a tunnel through an LNS, to enable the LNS to re-mark the priorities of service packets entering the tunnel after performing CAR so that packets can be classified and IP traffic can enter and leave the network at a specific rate, run the lns schedule after car command. This configuration facilitates better network operation and provides guaranteed QoS.\nPrecautions\nThe configuration takes effect only for tunnels established after the command is run."
