    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an L2TP access scenario, the LNS immediately responds with an SCCRP message for tunnel establishment upon receipt of an SCCRQ message from the LAC by default. To delay tunnel establishment, run the tunnel packet sccrp send delay command to enable the LNS to delay sending an SCCRP message based on the delay time in an LNS-delivered FES entry.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the tunnel packet sccrp send delay command is run, the LNS delay sending SCCRP messages for tunnel establishment in accordance with the configured delay time."
