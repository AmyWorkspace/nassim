    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA User group controls the user access authority based on ACL rules. To control the user access authority, run this command to bind an existing group to the domain.\nPrerequisites\nThe user group to be bound to the domain has been created.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe user group can be configured on the Router or be distributed by the RADIUS server. There is no need to configure this command when the user group is distributed by the RADIUS server.\nIf you want to redirect to anther user group, you can configure a redirect domain and then bind the user group to the configured domain. In this way, the authenticated users and unauthenticated users can access the network from different domains.\nFor the same user-group, the user-group (AAA domain view) command is exclusive with the user-group bind nat instance(AAA domain view) command."
