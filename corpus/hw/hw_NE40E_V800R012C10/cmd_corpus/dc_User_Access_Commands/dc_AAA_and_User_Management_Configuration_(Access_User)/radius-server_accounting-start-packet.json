    "ExtraInfo": "If the device sends accounting-start packets to a RADIUS accounting server in the Down state, the device is required to cache accounting-start packets before the RADIUS accounting server goes Up.\nAfter the radius-server accounting-start-packet resend command is run, the device caches accounting-start packets to a queue if the device fails to transmit accounting-start packets to the RADIUS accounting server. the device attempts to retransmit the cached accounting-start packets to the RADIUS accounting server every 10s. When the number of retransmission failures reaches the configured number of times that accounting-start packets are retransmitted to the RADIUS accounting server, the device discards the packets.\nIn some cases, when the device sends accounting stop packets, a RADIUS server is in the Down state. If you want the device to cache accounting stop packets that fail to be sent and retransmit them, run the radius-server accounting-stop-packet resend command.\nAfter the radius-server accounting-stop-packet resend command is run, the device caches each accounting stop packet that fails to be sent to the RADIUS accounting server, and retransmits it at an interval of 10s. When the number of retransmission failures reaches the specified number of retransmission times, the device discards the cached accounting stop packet."
