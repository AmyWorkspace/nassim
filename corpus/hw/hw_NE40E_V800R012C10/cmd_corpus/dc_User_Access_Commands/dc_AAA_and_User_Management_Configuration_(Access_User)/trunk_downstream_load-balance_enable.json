    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable load balancing for downstream traffic on user-side Eth-Trunk interfaces in a domain for user access, run the trunk downstream load-balance enable command.The downstream traffic refer to network-to-user traffic.\nPrecautions\nAfter this command is run, load balancing also takes effect for network-to-user traffic on an inter-board Eth-Trunk interface.\nIf the igmp enable command has been run in the interface view, the trunk downstream load-balance enable command can be issued, but does not take effect.\nAfter the trunk downstream load-balance enable command is run in the domain view, it takes effect for downstream traffic on a trunk interface only if the trunk interface has the load-balance { src-dst-mac | src-dst-ip | packet-all } command configuration.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
