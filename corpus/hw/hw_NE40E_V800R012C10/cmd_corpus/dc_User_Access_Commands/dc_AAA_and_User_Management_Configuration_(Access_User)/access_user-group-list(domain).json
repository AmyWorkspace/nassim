    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo distribute the traffic of users who go online through the same domain to different centralized CGN devices based on the user group weight, you need to configure a user group load balancing group, add user groups (each with a weight) to the user group load balancing group, and run the access user-group-list command to bind the user group load balancing group to the domain.\nPrerequisites\nA user group load balancing group has been created using the access user-group-list (system view) command.\nPrecautions\nOnly one user group load balancing group can be bound to a domain.\nThe same user group load balancing group can be bound to different domains.\nA user group that is not bound to a NAT instance and a user group load balancing group are mutually exclusive in the same domain."
