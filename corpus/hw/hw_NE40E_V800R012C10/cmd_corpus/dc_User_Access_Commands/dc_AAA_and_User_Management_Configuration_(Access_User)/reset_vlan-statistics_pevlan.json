    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen you run the display vlan-statistics pevlan command to check user traffic statistics based on a specified inner or outer VLAN ID on a device, a large number of historical statistics may be displayed, which makes data analysis difficult. To resolve this problem, run the reset vlan-statistics pevlan command to clear the existing statistics before running the display vlan-statistics pevlan command to view the newly collected statistics.\nPrecautions\nStatistics cannot be restored after you clear them. Therefore, exercise caution when running the reset vlan statistics command."
