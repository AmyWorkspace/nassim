    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf you cannot change the user group to which an online user belongs because the dynamic authorization server is Down, run the reauthorize enable command to enable command-line reauthorization.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the reauthorize command to change the user group to which an online user belongs.\nIn network planning, ACLs are used to control user access authority, and ACL rules are configured based on user groups. Therefore, to change a user's access authority, you can change the user group. For example, ACL rules are configured to allow user group 1 to access only the internal network and user group 2 to access both internal and external networks. When user A in user group 1 goes online, user A can access the internal network only. To allow user A to access both internal and external networks, reauthorize user A by changing its user group to user group 2.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
