    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo transfer bills in the CF card to a bill server when the automatic bill transfer condition is not met or when automatic bill transfer is not enabled, run the local-bill cfcard backup command to manually transfer the bills in the CF card.\nBefore you run this command, ensure that a bill server has been configured properly. If the file-name parameter is not set in the command, bills are stored in the file that has the name specified in the file-name parameter for the bill server.\nIf the file-name parameter is set in the command, the file name is in the format of main file name-time number.lam. For example, if the main file name is backupfile, bills are transferred at 15:26:28 on November 15, 2016, and 10 files are generated, the file name of the fifth file is backupfile-20161115152628005.lam.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
