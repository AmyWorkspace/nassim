    "ExtraInfo": "When a domain has public and private network users, a BRAS sends public IP address pool status through HW-Public-IP-Addr-State attribute to a RADIUS server. The RADIUS server determines whether a user is a public or private network user based on user information and the public IP address pool status. The RADIUS server then sends the corresponding user group name through Filter-Id attribute , IP address pool name through Framed-Pool attribute or IP address pool group name through HW-Framed-Pool-Group to the BRAS. The BRAS determines whether the user is a public or private network user based on the received user group name and assigns an IP address to the user from the received IP address pool or IP address pool group. To view information about public IP address pool status in the domain, run the display ip-pool usage-status command."
