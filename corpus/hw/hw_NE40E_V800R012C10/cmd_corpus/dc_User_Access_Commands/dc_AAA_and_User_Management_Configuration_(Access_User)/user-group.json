    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nUser groups are used to control user access in different domains for ACL control. To control user access in different domains, run the user-group command to create a user group, configure a QoS policy for the user group, and run the user-group (AAA domain view) to bind the user group to a specific domain.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nA user group can be bound to multiple domains, but one domain can be bound to only one user group.\nYou cannot delete a user group that is not created."
