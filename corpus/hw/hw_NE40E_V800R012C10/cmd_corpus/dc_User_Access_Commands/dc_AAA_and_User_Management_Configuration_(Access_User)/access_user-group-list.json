    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo distribute the traffic of users that go online through the same domain to different centralized CGN devices based on the user group weight, you need to run the access user-group-list command to configure a user group load balancing group, add user groups (each with a weight) to the user group load balancing group, and run the access user-group-list (AAA domain view) command to bind the user group load balancing group to the domain.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of eight user group load balancing groups can be configured in the system.\nTo delete a user group load balancing group that is bound to a domain, you need to unbind it from the domain before you delete it from the system."
