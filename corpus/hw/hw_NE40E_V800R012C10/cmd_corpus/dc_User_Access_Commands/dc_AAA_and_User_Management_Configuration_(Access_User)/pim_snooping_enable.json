    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the pim snooping enable command is run in the interface view, users who log in through this interface will send PIM Report packets. If the undo pim snooping enable command is run in the AAA domain view, the NE40E processes only PIM Report packets sent from users in other domains. This saves resources of the NE40E and multicast source and easing their burdens.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nTo enable the NE40E to process PIM Report packets sent from users in a specific domain, you must enable PIM in the domain and interface through which users log in.\nThe pim snooping enable command takes effect for PPPoEv4, L2TPv4, and L2TPv6 users."
