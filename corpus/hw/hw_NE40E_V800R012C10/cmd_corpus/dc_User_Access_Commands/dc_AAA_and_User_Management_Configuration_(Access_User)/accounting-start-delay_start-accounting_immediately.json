    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a delay is configured for the sending of dual-stack users' accounting-start packets, a device sends an accounting-start packet after both stack addresses are assigned. If you want the device to send an accounting-start packet immediately after a user goes online through the IPv4 stack, run the accounting-start-delay ipv4 start-accounting immediately command. The accounting-start packet carries the IPv4 address assigned to the user. However, if the user goes online through the IPv6 stack first, the device waits for the user to go online through the IPv4 stack or the specified accounting-start delay to expire, and then sends an accounting-start packet.\nPrerequisites\nThe accounting-start-delay command has been run to delay the sending of accounting-start packets."
