    "ExtraInfo": "To stop using a domain, you can set the status of this domain to blocked. In this case, all the users in this domain are prevented from accessing the Internet, but the users who have gone online can remain online.\nA blocked domain still responds with PADO packets after receiving PADI packets from terminals.\nIn user access load balancing scenarios, PADI packets from a terminal can reach multiple BAS interfaces. If any of these BAS interfaces responds with PADO packets, the terminal user will use this BAS interface to go online. However, if the BAS interfaces that responds with PADO packets is blocked, the terminal user cannot go online. In this case, run the access-delay command in the BAS interface view to set an access delay after which the terminal user can re-select a BAS interface to go online."
