    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nGenerally, the RADIUS server generates a user entry only after the accounting succeeds. However, some RADIUS server users who have passed the authentication generate user entries in the database before the accounting, when they apply for IP addresses, for example. If the accounting fails due to some reasons, the IP addresses cannot be released, and users cannot go online. To address this problem, configure the radius-server accounting-stop-packet send force command to force the NE40E to send accounting stop packets to the RADIUS server to release the IP addresses.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the radius-server accounting-stop-packet send force command is run, the NE40E sends an accounting stop packet to the RADIUS server if the accounting for an authenticated user fails.\nThe command takes effect only when the accounting for the authenticated user fails and there is a user entry in the database.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
