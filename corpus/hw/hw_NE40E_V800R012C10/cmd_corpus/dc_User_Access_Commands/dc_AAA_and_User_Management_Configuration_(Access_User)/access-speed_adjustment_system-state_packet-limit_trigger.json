    "ExtraInfo": "If the system status of a router is poor, for example, the CPU or memory usage is high, run the access-speed adjustment system-state packet-limit trigger enable command to enable the device to reduce the rate at which ARP/IP/IPv6/ND packets that trigger user login are sent to the CPU. When the system status restores, the device increases the user access rate accordingly."
