    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a hot backup scenario where a domain name is delivered by the RADIUS server or carried in a packet from a user terminal, the backup device must map the domain name into different domain names for different RBSs to ensure resource independency in the RBSs.\nIf the extend keyword is not configured, domain names to be mapped must be delivered by the RADIUS server.If the extend keyword is configured, domain names to be mapped can be or not be delivered by the RADIUS server. RADIUS-delivered domain names are preferentially matched.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nA domain mapping list supports a maximum of 128 domain mappings.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
