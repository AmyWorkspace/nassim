    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn user access scenarios, SAID nodes can detect and diagnose user login failures.\nOne fault detection trigger condition for SAID nodes is the login failure increment, which is 10000 by default, within 10 minutes.\nTo adjust this trigger condition, run the aaa-said check-rule rule1 command to set a login failure increment within 10 minutes.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
