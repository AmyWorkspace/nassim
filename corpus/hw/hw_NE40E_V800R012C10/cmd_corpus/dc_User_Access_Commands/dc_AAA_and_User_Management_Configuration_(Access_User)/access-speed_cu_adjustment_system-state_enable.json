    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn CU separation scenarios, if the control channel is overloaded, for example, the user access rate is slow or users fail to go online due to high CUSP queue depth usage, run the access-speed cu adjustment system-state enable command to enable the NE40E to decrease the user access rate.\nPrerequisites\nThe CUSP has been configured on the CP. For details, see Configuring a CUSP controller (CP).\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the access-speed cu adjustment system-state enable command is run, the device automatically adjusts the user access rate based on the CUSP queue depth usage on the CP or UP. If the CUSP queue depth usage goes high, the device decreases the user access rate. If the CUSP queue depth usage restores, the device increases the user access rate."
