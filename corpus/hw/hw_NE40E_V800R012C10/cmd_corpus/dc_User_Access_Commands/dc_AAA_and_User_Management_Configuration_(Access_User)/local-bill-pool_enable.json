    "ExtraInfo": "If a RADIUS server is configured to implement the accounting for access users or value-added services, the\nRouter allows the generation of local bills under the following scenarios:\nAn accounting stop request is triggered by a user or value-added service, but the RADIUS server does not respond. In this case, the Router generates a local bill to record the accounting information and considers that the user is offline.The accounting start-fail online command is run to allow a user to go online even if accounting fails to start for the user. When users go offline, local bills can be created to record accounting information.\nLocal bills can be transferred to a bill server for account reconciliation on the RADIUS server. To allow the generation of local bills, run the local-bill-pool enable command to create a local bill pool."
