    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAs specified in the standard RADIUS protocol, the Class attribute carried in an access-accept packet sent from the RADIUS server to the client must be returned to the accounting server without any change in an accounting-request packet. Based on the standard protocol, the device makes extensions by adding the function of transferring the committed access rate (CAR) values. That is, in the implementation of the Class attribute, the CAR value in the Class field is carried.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
