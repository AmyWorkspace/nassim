    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the device to send the CMCC-NAS-Type attribute through Access-Request packets and accounting packets in a scenario where the device is connected to the RADIUS server, run the radius-attribute include cmcc-nas-type command. The attribute helps distinguish non-CU separation devices from CU separation devices. For non-CU separation devices, the value of the CMCC-NAS-Type attribute is 1. For CU separation devices, the value of the CMCC-NAS-Type attribute is 2."
