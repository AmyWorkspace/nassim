    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo clear statistics about classifier-behavior pairs dynamically delivered by the RADIUS server, run the reset aaa remote-download acl statistics command. If a classifier is specified, statistics about classifier-behavior pairs with the specified classifier are cleared. If a slot ID is specified, statistics about classifier-behavior pairs on the specified board are cleared. If both a classifier and a slot ID are specified, statistics about classifier-behavior pairs with the specified classifier on the specified board are cleared.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nStatistics about classifier-behavior pairs dynamically delivered by the RADIUS server cannot be restored after they are cleared. Exercise caution when running this command."
