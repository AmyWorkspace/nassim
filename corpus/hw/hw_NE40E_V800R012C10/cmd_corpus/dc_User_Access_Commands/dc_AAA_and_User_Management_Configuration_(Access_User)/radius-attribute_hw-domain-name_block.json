    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen RADIUS authentication is configured for users, the users preferentially access through the domain delivered by the RADIUS server. By default, when the domain delivered by the RADIUS server is blocked, users can go online through this domain but cannot perform other operations. To prevent this situation, run the radius-attribute hw-domain-name block offline command in the RADIUS server group view so that new access users cannot go online through the domain delivered by the RADIUS server if the domain is blocked.\nConfiguration Impact\nThis command takes effect only for subsequent access users."
