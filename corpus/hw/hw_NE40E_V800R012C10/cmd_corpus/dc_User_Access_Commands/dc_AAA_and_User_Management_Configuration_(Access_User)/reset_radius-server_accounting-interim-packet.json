    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo clear real-time accounting packets from a cache queue, run the reset radius-server accounting-interim-packet command. If you specify all, all real-time accounting packets are cleared from a cache queue. If you specify ip, real-time accounting packets destined for the RADIUS server with the specified IP address are cleared.\nConfiguration Impact\nAccounting packets (including accounting start, real-time accounting, and accounting stop packets) that are newly generated during cached packet clearing are directly discarded without being cached.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
