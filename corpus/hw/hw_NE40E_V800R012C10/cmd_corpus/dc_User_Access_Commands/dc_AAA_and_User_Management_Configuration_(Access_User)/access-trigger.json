    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the user information backup table cannot be queried within two hours after the device restarts due to an exception, but original online users can still get online by using IP/ARP packets. You can run the access-trigger command to change the period during which users can get online in loose mode.If getting online in loose mode is not enabled, after the device restarts due to an exception, users can get online again only after lease renewal fails (after the lease expires) or users' terminals restart.\nPrerequisites\nGetting online triggered by IP/ARP packets has been enabled on a BAS interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter this command is executed, the filtering function of the user information backup table does not take effect, and IP/ARP packets sent by users will trigger getting online requests. As a result, the device needs to process a large number of getting online request packets, which uses a lot of resources and affects common users' access.\nAfter the device restarts, a large number of getting online request packets will increase the pressure on the DHCP server and RADIUS server.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
