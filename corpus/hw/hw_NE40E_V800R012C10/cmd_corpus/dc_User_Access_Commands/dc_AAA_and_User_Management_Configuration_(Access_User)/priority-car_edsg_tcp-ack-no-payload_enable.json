    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn normal rate test scenarios, null-payload TCP ACK packets for EDSG services are discarded, causing the rate to fall below the committed rate. To enable the device to preferentially forward null-payload TCPv4 ACK packets for EDSG services of LNS users, run the priority-car edsg tcp-ack-no-payload enable command. To enable the device to preferentially forward null-payload TCPv4 and TCPv6 ACK packets for EDSG services of LNS users, run the priority-car edsg tcp-ack-no-payload enable include lns ipv6 command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
