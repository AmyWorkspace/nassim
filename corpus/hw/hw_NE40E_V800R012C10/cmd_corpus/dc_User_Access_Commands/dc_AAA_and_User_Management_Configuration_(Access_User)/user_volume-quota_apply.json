    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhile providing prepaid services, carriers can perform accounting based on the upstream traffic, downstream traffic, or both the upstream and downstream traffic. To apply a user traffic volume quota to upstream or downstream traffic, run the user volume-quota apply command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the user volume-quota apply command is run, the user traffic volume quota decreases with the specified upstream or downstream traffic volume.\nIf the user volume-quota apply command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
