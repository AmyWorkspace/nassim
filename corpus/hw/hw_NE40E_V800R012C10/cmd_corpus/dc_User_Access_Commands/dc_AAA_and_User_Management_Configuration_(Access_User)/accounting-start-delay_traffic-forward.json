    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the scenario where a delay is configured for the sending of dual-stack users' accounting-start packets, after a dual-stack user goes online through a stack, the user has to wait to go online through the other stack before the user can access the network. The user may repeatedly go online and offline if the user fails to go online through the other stack in time. To prevent this issue, run the accounting-start-delay traffic-forward before-start-accounting command to allow a dual-stack user to access the network at a stack through which the user has gone online even if accounting has not been started for the user in the accounting-start delay scenario.\nPrerequisites\nThe accounting-start-delay command has been run to delay the sending of accounting-start packets."
