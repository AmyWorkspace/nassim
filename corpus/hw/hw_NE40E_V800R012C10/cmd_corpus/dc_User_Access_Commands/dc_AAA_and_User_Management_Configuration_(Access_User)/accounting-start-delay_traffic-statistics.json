    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the scenario where a delay is configured for the sending of dual-stack users' accounting-start packets, if dual-stack users are allowed to access the network after they go online through one stack even if accounting has not been started, traffic may be generated before accounting starts. To collect and report statistics about user traffic that is generated before accounting starts, run the accounting-start-delay traffic-statistics before-start-accounting command.\nPrerequisites\nThe accounting-start-delay command has been run to delay the sending of accounting-start packets.\nThe accounting-start-delay traffic-forward before-start-accounting command has been run to allow dual-stack users to access the network after they go online through one stack even if accounting has not been started."
