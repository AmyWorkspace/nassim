    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the authentication mode in an AAA domain is configured as RADIUS authentication + non-authentication, DHCP users can still go online when the RADIUS does not respond. However, when the RADIUS server is not responding, these users are not charged. To configure the device to deliver a lease for DHCP users, run the radius-no-response lease-time command. When the RADIUS server responds and a user attempts to update its lease, the device sends an NAK packet to the user. In this situation, the user is re-authenticated and charged.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe longer the lease configured using the radius-no-response lease-time command, the longer it takes for online DHCP users to be free of charge after the RADIUS server does not respond. DHCP users may log in and log out consecutively in a short period of time If the configured lease is too short.\nPrecautions\nThe radius-no-response lease-time command takes effect only for users who go online after the command is configured.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThis command can not be used in RUI scenarios and disaster recovery scenarios."
