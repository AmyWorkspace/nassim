    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a device trusts the Option 82 field in user packets and the Agent-Circuit-Id or Agent-Remote-Id attribute carried in user packets is longer than 63 bytes, the RADIUS packets do not carry the Agent-Circuit-Id or Agent-Remote-Id attribute.\nTo configure the maximum length of the Agent-Circuit-Id or Agent-Remote-Id attribute in RADIUS packets when a device trusts the Option 82 field in user packets as 198 bytes, run the radius-server access-line-id command.\nRADIUS packets include IPv4 user authentication packets, IPv4 user accounting packets, and service accounting packets.\nPrerequisites\nThe client-option82 command has been run on a BAS interface.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
