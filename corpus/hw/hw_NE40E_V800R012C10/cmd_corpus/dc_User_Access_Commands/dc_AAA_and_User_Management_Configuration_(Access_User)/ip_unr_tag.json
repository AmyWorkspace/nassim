    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allow the device to categorize and advertise host routes of IPv4 users and network segment routes generated based on the RADIUS-delivered Framed-Route attribute to different networks, run the ip unr tag command to set a route tag for the host routes and network segment routes. In this way, the device can import route tags based on routing policies and advertise different host routes of IPv4 users to different networks.\nPrecautions\nIf the ip unr tag command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one. If the ip unr tag, unr tag (IPv4), and ip unr framed-route-tag commands are run, the ip unr tag command takes effect."
