    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn RADIUS accounting scenarios, if accounting packet caching is enabled and the link between the RADIUS server and device fails or is busy, the device caches accounting packets that fail to be sent. Caching accounting packets consumes the main control board's memory. To prevent impact on device performance, run the radius-server accounting cache memory-threshold command to configure a memory usage threshold for the main control board.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the memory usage of the main control board reaches the configured threshold but the number of cached packets does not reach the value specified using the radius-server accounting cache max-packet-number command after the radius-server accounting cache memory-threshold command is run, the router releases the earliest user's all packets from the cache queue and caches newly generated accounting packets.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nWhen the memory usage of the main control board is high, caching packets causes the main control board to restart due to memory exhaustion. Therefore, you must properly configure a memory usage threshold."
