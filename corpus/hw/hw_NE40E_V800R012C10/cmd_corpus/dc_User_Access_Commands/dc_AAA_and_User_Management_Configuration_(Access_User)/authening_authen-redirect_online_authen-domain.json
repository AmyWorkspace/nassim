    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the user quota is used up. In this case, the device redirects users to the domain allowing the users to go online through this domain.\nIn actual applications, you can configure a pool of private network IP addresses, user ACL-based access rights, and security domains in a redirection domain. In this manner, you can configure and isolate allocation of Internet and private network IP addresses, access rights in a differentiated manner. This saves Internet IP addresses and prevents users from occupying a great number of Internet IP addresses through illegal attacks.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
