    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe SAID is used to identify typical faults and automatically diagnose and rectify the faults. The SAID function is enabled by default in typical BRAS scenarios. To disable the SAID function, run the aaa-said disable command. After the SAID function is enabled, the device periodically detects whether the number of online users or traffic rates are abnormal. When a large number of login failures or a sudden decrease in traffic is diagnosed and the time condition for self-healing is met, the system generates a log and determines whether to trigger self-healing (reset the subcard).\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
