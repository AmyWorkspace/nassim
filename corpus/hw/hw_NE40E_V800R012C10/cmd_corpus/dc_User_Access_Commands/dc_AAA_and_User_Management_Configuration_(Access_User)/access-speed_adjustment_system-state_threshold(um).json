    "FuncDef": "The access-speed adjustment system-state threshold access-queue length command sets a size threshold for the UM message queue, so that the device can control the UM message queue usage. When the usage of the UM message queue reaches a specified threshold, the system decreases or increases the CPCAR value to control the number of user packets that can be sent to the CPU.\nThe undo access-speed adjustment system-state threshold access-queue length command restores the default setting.\nBy default, the size threshold for the UM message queue is 24 KB.",

    "ExtraInfo": "When a large number of users go online and the system CPU is busy, run the access-speed adjustment system-state threshold access-queue command to set a proper size threshold for the UM message queue (the size threshold serves as the denominator for queue usage calculation), so that the device can adjust the UM message queue usage to control the number of user packets that can be sent to the CPU, as well as the user access rate."
