    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the maximum number of classifier-behavior pairs allowed by a device have been used, the device does not process classifier-behavior pairs further delivered by the RADIUS server. To prevent this problem, run the remote-download acl warning-threshold command to configure the alarm threshold for the usage of classifier-behavior pairs so that the device can reclaim the classifier-behavior pairs not in use.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter this command is run, an alarm is generated if the usage of classifier-behavior pairs reaches the specified alarm threshold, and a clear alarm is generated if the usage of classifier-behavior pairs falls below 90% of the alarm threshold.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
