    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo bind a PW-VE interface to a location group, run the bind location-group command so that services on the PW-VE interface are processed on the board where the interface bound to the location group resides.\nPrecautions\nA PW-VE main interface can be bound to only one location group, and no PW-VE sub-interface can be bound to a location group. If the bind location-group command is run more than once in the PW-VE interface view, the latest configuration takes effect only when no user is online on the PW-VE interface."
