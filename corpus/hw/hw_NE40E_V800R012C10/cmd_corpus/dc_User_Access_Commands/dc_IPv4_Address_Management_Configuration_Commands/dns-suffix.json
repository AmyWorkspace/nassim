    "ExtraInfo": "Every DHCP client has its own domain name. To allow communication between DHCP clients through domain names and avoid IP address conflicts during domain name resolution, run the dns-suffix command to configure a DNS domain name suffix. The DHCP server sends the DNS domain name to DHCP clients through Option 15 during IP address assignment. DHCP clients then add a suffix to the DNS domain name for resolution."
