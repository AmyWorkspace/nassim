    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a user fails to apply for an address in an address pool for 50 consecutive times, this address pool is considered faulty and will be automatically isolated. The device then preferentially selects an IP address from another available address pool. The device continues to select the current address pool only when no other address pool is available.\nBy default, the master/slave control board switchover is triggered when the number of IPv4 address pool isolation times reaches 20. The master/slave control board switchover can be triggered only once within 24 hours. If the address pool on the master control board is isolated and the address pool on the slave control board is not isolated, run the ip-pool auto-block slave-switch enable command to enable the function to associate IPv4 address pool isolation with master/slave control board switchover to trigger a master/slave control board switchover.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
