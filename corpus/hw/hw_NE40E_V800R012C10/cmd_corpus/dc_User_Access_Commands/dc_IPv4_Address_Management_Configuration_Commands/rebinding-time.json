    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe rebinding time of an IP address must be shorter than the lease of the address pool and longer than the lease of the IP address.\nIf the value of rebinding time is set to 0 after the rebinding-time command is configured, the value of rebinding time restores the default value. If the rebinding-time command is not configured, setting the value of rebinding time to 0 is meaningless.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
