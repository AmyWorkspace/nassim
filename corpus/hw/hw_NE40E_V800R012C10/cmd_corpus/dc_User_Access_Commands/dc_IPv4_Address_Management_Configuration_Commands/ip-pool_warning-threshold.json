    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an alarm threshold for the address usage of the IPv4 address pools bound to a VPN instance, run the ip-pool warning-threshold command so that the NE40E generates an alarm when the IPv4 address usage reaches the threshold. This prompts the administrator to plan addresses to prevent user login failures due to address exhaustion.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
