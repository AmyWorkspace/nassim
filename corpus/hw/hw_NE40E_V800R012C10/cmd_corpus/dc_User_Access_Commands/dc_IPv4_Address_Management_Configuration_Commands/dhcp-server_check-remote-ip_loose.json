    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a scenario where DHCP users go online from a remote address pool, the BRAS checks whether the IP addresses assigned by the DHCP server are on the network segment to which the gateway address of the remote address pool belongs by default. If the assigned IP addresses and the gateway address of the remote address pool are not on the same network segment, the users cannot go online. To allow users to go online, run the dhcp-server check-remote-ip loose command to disable the BRAS from checking whether the IP addresses assigned by the DHCP server are on the network segment to which the gateway address of the remote address pool belongs.\nPrecautions\nThe dhcp-server check-remote-ip loose command takes effect for remote address pools and remote RUI address pools only."
