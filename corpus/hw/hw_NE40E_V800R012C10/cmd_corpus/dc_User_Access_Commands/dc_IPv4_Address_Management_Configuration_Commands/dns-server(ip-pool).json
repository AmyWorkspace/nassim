    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore a host accesses the Internet, the DNS server needs to be used to resolve a domain name to an IP address. To allow a DHCP client to properly access the Internet, run the dns-server command to configure the IP address of a DHCP server so that the DHCP server can send DNS server addresses to DHCP clients through Option 6.\nIf DNS server addresses have been configured in an address pool, running the dns-server command adds new DNS server addresses but does not delete the configured ones. To delete the configured ones, run the undo dns-server command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
