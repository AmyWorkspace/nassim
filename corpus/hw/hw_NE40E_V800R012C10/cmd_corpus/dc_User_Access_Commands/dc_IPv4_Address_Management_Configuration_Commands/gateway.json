    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore allocating IP addresses in an address pool, you need to configure a gateway IP address in the address pool. In the address pool on the BAS, the configured gateway IP address is also used for advertising User Network Routes. The gateway IP address in the address pool on the BAS cannot be the IP address of any interface on the device. When the address pool is bound to a domain, you must unbind the address pool from the domain before modifying the gateway IP address.\nThe address of the gateway cannot be within any of the address segment in any IP address pool.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
