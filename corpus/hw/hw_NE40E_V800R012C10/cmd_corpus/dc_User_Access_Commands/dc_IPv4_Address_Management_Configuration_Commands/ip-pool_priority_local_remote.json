    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a device to prefer a local or remote IP address pool in a domain, run the ip-pool priority command. To delete the preference, run the undo ip-pool priority command.\nWhen Layer 2 or Layer 3 users access a device, they must be assigned IP addresses from an IP address pool in a domain. You can run the ip-pool priority command to configure the device to preferentially select a desired IP address pool.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nIf a device is configured to prefer a remote address pool in a domain for address assignment, IP addresses can only be assigned from a remote address pool for vCPE users."
