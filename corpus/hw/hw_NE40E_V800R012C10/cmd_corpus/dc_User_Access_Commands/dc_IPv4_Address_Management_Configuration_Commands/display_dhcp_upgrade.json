    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the BRAS to be upgraded have DHCP users, run the dhcp upgrade command to modify leases of these users to a shorter period, so that DHCP users can get online by sending renewal packets after the BRAS is restarted after the upgrade.\nThe dhcp upgrade command cannot be saved to the configuration file. You need to run the display dhcp upgrade command to view the dhcp upgrade command configuration. Then you can calculate the restart time of the BRAS based on the number of users with old leases and maximum remaining time for users with old leases to send renewal packets.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
