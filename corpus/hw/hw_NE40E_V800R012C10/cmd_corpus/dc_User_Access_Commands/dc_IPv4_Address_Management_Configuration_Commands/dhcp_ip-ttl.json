    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can set a TTL value as required using the dhcp ip-ttl command. The DHCP server or DHCP Relay will send DHCP response packets based on the TTL value. When the device functions as a DHCP server or DHCP Relay, if the response packets are broadcast packets, the TTL default value is set to 1. If the response packets are unicast packets, the response packets are processed based on the TTL value encapsulated in the response packets, and therefore there is no fixed default value.\nIf you run the dhcp ip-ttl ttl-value command to configure a TTL value, the configured TTL value takes effect.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
