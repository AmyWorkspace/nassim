    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the DHCPv4 server backup scenario, the device functioning as a DHCP relay sends Rebind packets only to the master DNCPv4 server by default. If the master DHCPv4 server is Down, the backup DHCPv4 servers cannot automatically take over. To resolve this problem, run the dhcp rebind forward-mode all command on the device to send DHCP Rebind packets to the master and backup DHCPv4 servers simultaneously. Even if one of the servers is Down, the others can still receive Rebinds packets.\nThe DHCPv4 server group must contain multiple servers.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you run the dhcp rebind forward-mode all command, the device forwards DHCP Rebind packets to all DHCPv4 servers in a DHCPv4 server group.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
