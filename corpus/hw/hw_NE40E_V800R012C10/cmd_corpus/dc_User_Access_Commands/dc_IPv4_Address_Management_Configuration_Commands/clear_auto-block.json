    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an address pool is abnormal, address allocation fails. If an address pool is selected but address allocation fails for 10 consecutive times, the system automatically locks the address pool. To manually unlock an address pool that has been automatically locked by the system, run the clear auto-block command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter this command is run, the automatic locking status of the DHCP address pool, the number of automatic locking times, and the number of consecutive address allocation failures are all cleared.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThis command clears the automatic locking status of an DHCP address pool, but does not remove the automatic locking function of this DHCP address pool. By default, the automatic locking function is enabled for DHCP address pools."
