    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the device needs to allocate IP addresses to users using the RADIUS server, configure the frame-ip lease manage command to enable the lease management function of IP addresses delivered by the RADIUS server.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the frame-ip lease manage command is configured, the lease management function of IP addresses delivered by the RADIUS server is enabled. If the RADIUS delivers IP addresses with a lease, the delivered lease takes effect. If the RADIUS server only delivers IP addresses, the lease configured using the lease command in the IP address pool takes effect.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThis command can only be configured in the local IP address pool and applies only to IP addresses of Layer 2 common DHCP users delivered by the RADIUS server."
