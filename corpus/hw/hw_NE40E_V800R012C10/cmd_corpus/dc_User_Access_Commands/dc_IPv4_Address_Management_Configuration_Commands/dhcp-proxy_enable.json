    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo guarantee the security of the DHCP server, you need to run the dhcp-proxy enable command when the DHCP packet sent from the device to a user does not contain the DHCP server IP address.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter DHCP proxy is enabled on the BAS interface, when a DHCP packet is received on the BAS interface and the BAS remote address pool is used, the server IP address in the option54 of the DHCP packet sent from the device to the user is the device IP address.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nCurrently, DHCP proxy is used only for the BAS remote address pool of the BAS. The configuration modification does not take effect on online users.\nDHCP proxy can also be used for Layer 2 users or Layer 2 leased line users."
