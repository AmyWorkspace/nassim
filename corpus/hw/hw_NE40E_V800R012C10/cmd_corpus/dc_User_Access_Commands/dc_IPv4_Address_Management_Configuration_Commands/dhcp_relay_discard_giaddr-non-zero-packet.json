    "ExtraInfo": "In BAS relay scenarios in which a BAS interface is configured that functions as a DHCP relay agent for user access, the device by default allows Layer 3 remote DHCP clients that send DHCP packets with a non-zero GiAddr address to go online. To prevent Layer 3 remote DHCP clients that send DHCP packets with a non-zero GiAddr address from going online, run the dhcp relay discard giaddr-non-zero-packet command so that the device discards this type of DHCP packet."
