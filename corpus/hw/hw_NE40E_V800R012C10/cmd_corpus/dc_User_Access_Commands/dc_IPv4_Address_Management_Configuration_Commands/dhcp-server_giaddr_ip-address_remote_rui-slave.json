    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn BRAS dual-device hot backup scenarios where a remote address pool is used for address allocation, if the DHCP server can only respond with a packet carrying the GiAddr address and not the source IP address, the double gateway solution must be used. To specify an IP address in the address pool to function as the GiAddr address, run the dhcp-server giaddr ip-address command. The IP address specified cannot be the same as the gateway address of the address pool.\nThe DHCP server cannot allocate the GiAddr address to any terminal.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe GiAddr address specified by ip-addr cannot conflict with any user IP address."
