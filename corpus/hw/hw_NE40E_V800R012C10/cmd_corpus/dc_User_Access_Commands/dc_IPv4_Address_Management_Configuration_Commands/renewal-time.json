    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe renewal time of an IP address must be shorter than the lease of the IP address pool and the rebinding time of the IP address.\nIf the value of renewal time is set to 0 after the renewal-time command is configured, the value of renewal time restores the default value. If the renewal-time command is not configured, setting the value of renewal time to 0 is meaningless.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
