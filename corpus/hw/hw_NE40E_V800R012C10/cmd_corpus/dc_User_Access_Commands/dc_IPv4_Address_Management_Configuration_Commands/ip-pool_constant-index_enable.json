The indexes for these pools automatically change after the device where these pools reside restarts.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a device where IP pools reside restarts, the NMS loses all IP pool statistics and can no longer monitor these IP pools. This problem can be solved by configuring constant indexes for IP pools.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ip-pool constant-index enable command is run, indexes for the IPv4 address pool ( except server type), IPv6 prefix pool, and IPv6 address pool remain unchanged after the device restarts. The constant-index  command is automatically generated in corresponding IPv4 address pool, IPv6 prefix pool, and IPv6 address pool views for users to check the constant index value. But the constant-index command cannot be used to change the automatically generated constant index for an IP pool.\nAfter the ip-pool constant-index disable command is run, the constant-index  command is automatically deleted from the IPv4 address pool, IPv6 prefix pool, and IPv6 address pool views.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
