    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter receiving a DHCP decline packet from a user, the device cuts off the connection with the user and processes the IP address of the user. The device command can be used to configure the action taken by the device on the user IP address after the device receives a DHCP decline packet.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen a user IP address has been set to the Conflict state, the device will generate an address conflict command line in the address pool view. After the Conflict state of the IP address is cancelled by running the reset conflict-ip-address command, the address can be assigned to another user.\nWhen the user IP address has been set to the Idle state, the device does not generate an address conflict command line in the address pool view. The IP address can be assigned to another user.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
