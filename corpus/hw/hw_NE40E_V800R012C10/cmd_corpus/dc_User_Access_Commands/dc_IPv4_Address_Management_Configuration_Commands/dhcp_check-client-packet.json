    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, when the device receives a Release packet from a DHCP client, the device only checks the MAC address and the status of the client carried in the packet but does not check information such as VLANs and interfaces. The client whose MAC address is the same as that in the Release packet goes offline. However, if multiple users have the same MAC address but belong to different VLANs or interfaces, this may cause these users to simultaneously go offline. To prevent this from happening, run the dhcp check-client-packet strict command to strictly check packets from a DHCP client.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the dhcp check-client-packet strict command is run, the device strictly checks information such as the MAC address, VLAN IDs, interface information carried in the Release packet from a DHCP client. The online user whose information strictly matches that in the packet goes offline.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
