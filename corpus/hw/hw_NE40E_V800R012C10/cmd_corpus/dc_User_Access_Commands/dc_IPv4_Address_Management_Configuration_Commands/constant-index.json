    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the ip-pool constant-index enable command is configured on a device where IPv4 address pools, IPv6 prefix pools, and IPv6 address pools reside, indexes for these pools remain unchanged after the device is restarted. The constant-index command is automatically generated in corresponding IPv4 address pool, IPv6 prefix pool, and IPv6 address pool views. But the constant-index command cannot be used to change the automatically generated constant index for an IP pool.\nPrerequisites\nThe ip-pool constant-index enable command has been run in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe constant-index command does not have the undo form. The constant-index command is automatically deleted from IPv4 address pool, IPv6 prefix pool, and IPv6 address pool views when the undo ip-pool constant-index enable command is run.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
