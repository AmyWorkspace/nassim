    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a gateway is configured for IPv4 local and remote address pools, network segment routes are generated for forwarding user traffic to the local device. If the network segment routes of the address become unavailable or are incorrectly deleted, user traffic cannot be forwarded to the local device, causing user login failures. This problem can be resolved by auto-refresh of address pool routes.\nHowever, if incorrect routes are repeatedly generated for IP addresses in the address pool, run the ip-pool route auto-refresh disable command to disable auto-refresh of address pool routes.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
