    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, IPv4 addresses are allocated in the sequence of the address pools. This may cause imbalance in address allocation. To allow the device to allocate addresses from different address pools in turn, run the ip-pool algorithm round-robin command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ip-pool algorithm round-robin command is run, the device allocates addresses from different address pools in turn.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
