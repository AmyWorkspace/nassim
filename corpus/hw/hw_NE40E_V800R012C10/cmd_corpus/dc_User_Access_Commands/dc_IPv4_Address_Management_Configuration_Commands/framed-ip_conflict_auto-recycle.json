    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, if an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address/prefix is assigned to a DHCP or PPP user in a RADIUS authentication response, the IPv4 address remains in the conflicted state and the IPv6 address/prefix remains in the radius state after the user goes offline. This IP address or prefix can be reused only when being assigned in another RADIUS authentication response. Users whose IP addresses or prefixes are assigned in other methods cannot use this IP address or prefix to go online. After you configure the framed-ip conflict auto-recycle command, the IP address or prefix assigned in a RADIUS authentication response is changed to be in the idle state after the user goes offline. In addition, this IP address or prefix can be used in other methods for assigning IP addresses.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThis command takes effect only for DHCP and PPP users."
