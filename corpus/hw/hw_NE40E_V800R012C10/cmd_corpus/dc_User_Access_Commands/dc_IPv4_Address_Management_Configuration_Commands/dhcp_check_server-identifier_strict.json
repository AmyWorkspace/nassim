After the command is run, a user gateway does not send an ACK message in response to a DHCP Request message if the DHCP server IP address carried in the request is different from the user's gateway IP address.\nThe undo dhcp check server-identifier strict command restores the default configuration.\nBy default, strict check for DHCP server IP addresses in DHCP Request messages is disabled.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a cold backup scenario, if the master and backup devices' gateway addresses are different but belong to the same network segment, the two devices may assign the same IP address to a user. As a result, the user goes online through both devices. To resolve this issue, run the dhcp check server-identifier strict command to enable strict check for DHCP server IP addresses in DHCP Request messages. After the command is run, a user gateway does not send an ACK message in response to a DHCP Request message if the DHCP server IP address carried in the request is different from the user's gateway IP address. The user then goes online only through the other device.\nPrerequisites\nThe dhcp check-server-pkt loose command has been run in the system view.\nThe access packet strict-check dhcp command is not run in the system view.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
