When the device received DHCPv4 Discover, DHCPv4 Offer, and DHCPv4 Request packets , if the user entries exist, the users will be get offline.\nBy default, DHCPv4 packets transparently transmitting is enabled.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a user restarts a Set Top Box (STB) immediately after switching it off, the device cannot sense that the user is offline. Thus, the user entry still exists. When receiving the DHCPv4 Discover packet from the STB during the restart of the STB, the device requests the user to go offline and waits for the user to resend a DHCPv4 Discover packet to obtain the DHCPv4 address.\nCertain STBs, however, send DHCPv4 Discover packets only once during the restart. Thus, the users of these STBs cannot go online.\nIn this case, you can use the dhcp through-packet command to enable the device to transparently transmit DHCPv4 packets.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
