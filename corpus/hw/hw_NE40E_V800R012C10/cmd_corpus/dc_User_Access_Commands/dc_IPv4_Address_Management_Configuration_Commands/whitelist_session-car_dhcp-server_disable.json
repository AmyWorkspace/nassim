    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe DHCPv4 session CAR function is enabled by default. It isolates packet channels between DHCPv4 sessions, preventing packets over different DHCPv4 sessions from preempting bandwidth resources. To disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car dhcp-server disable command. DHCPv4 packets received by this device will then be sent directly through the DHCPv4-specific CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of DHCPv4 packets, packets from different DHCPv4 sessions preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not usually recommended.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
