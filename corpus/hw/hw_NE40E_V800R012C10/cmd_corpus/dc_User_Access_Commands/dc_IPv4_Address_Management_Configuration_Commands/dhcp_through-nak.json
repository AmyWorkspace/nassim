    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn scenarios where IP addresses are assigned from a DHCP remote address pool, if a DHCP client sends a Discover message to the DHCP server through a BRAS and the BRAS receives a NAK message from the DHCP server, the BRAS discards the NAK message by default. To prevent this problem, run the dhcp through-nak command to enable the BRAS to transparently transmit NAK messages to the clients.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
