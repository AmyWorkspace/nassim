    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen receiving a DHCP Request message from a client, the BRAS encapsulates the remote-id and circuit-id sub-attributes into the Option 82 attribute of the message. However, some DHCP servers may not be able to parse the carried remote-id sub-attribute. To resolve the problem, run the dhcp option-82 agent-remote-id strip command to enable the BRAS to delete the remote-id sub-attribute carried in a received DHCP Request message before transparently transmitting the message to the DHCP server. After receiving a response message from the DHCP server, the BRAS inserts the remote-id sub-attribute into the message before forwarding it to the client.\nPrerequisites\nThe client-option82 [ basinfo-insert cn-telecom | version1 ] command has been run in the BAS interface view.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nIf the dhcp option-82 agent-remote-id strip and dhcp option82 rebuild version3 send-to-server commands are both run in the BAS interface view, the dhcp option82 rebuild version3 send-to-server command takes effect."
