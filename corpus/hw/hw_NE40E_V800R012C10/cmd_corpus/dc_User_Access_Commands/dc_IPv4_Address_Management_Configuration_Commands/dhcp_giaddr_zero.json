    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo make clients unaware that IPv4 addresses are assigned by a relay agent, run the dhcp giaddr zero user-type layer2 command to enable a device to set the giaddr field to zero in a DHCPv4 message to be sent to a DHCPv4 client in Layer 2 access scenarios. This protects the gateway address carried in the giaddr field of a DHCPv4 message. A DHCP server inserts the gateway address into the giaddr field of a DHCPv4 message to be sent to a client. However, in Layer 2 access scenarios, setting the giaddr field to 0.0.0.0 is more appropriate.\nLayer 2 access DHCPv4 clients include DHCPv4 users who go online through a BAS interface with access type set to  or  using the access-type command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
