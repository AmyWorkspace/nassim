    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou need to run this command when configuring a static user. If you do not use this parameter, only the start IP address is disabled.\nTo reserve some IP addresses for special uses, you can use the excluded-ip-address command to disable them.\nAfter the excluded-ip-address command is executed to disable an IP address in an address pool, an address pool alarm is generated when the number of IP addresses in the address pool reaches the alarm threshold.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nWhen the excluded-ip-address command is run in a remote address pool, only the IP addresses disabled on the remote server and the GIADDR address can be excluded."
