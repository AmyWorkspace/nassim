    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a logic host name used to generate RUI user accounting IDs and used by RADIUS packet attributes, run the nas logic-sysname command. When generating user accounting IDs, a device uses the first seven characters of a logic host name. When a logic host name must be configured as different character strings that are used to generate RUI user accounting IDs and used by Radius packet attributes, run the acct-session-id nas-logic-sysname to configure the logic host name preferentially used to generate user accounting IDs.\nPrerequisites\nBRAS users backup service has been started in the remote backup profile view.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nRunning the acct-session-id nas-logic-sysname command affects RUI user accounting IDs."
