    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn RUI scenarios, lower-layer switches broadcast DHCPv4 Release messages sent by users requesting to go offline to the master and backup devices. A time sequence problem may cause the system to record different logout reasons on the master and backup devices. To enable the backup device to discard received DHCPv4 Release messages, run the access packet dhcp release rui-slave discard command, so that logout reasons recorded on the master and backup device are the same.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
