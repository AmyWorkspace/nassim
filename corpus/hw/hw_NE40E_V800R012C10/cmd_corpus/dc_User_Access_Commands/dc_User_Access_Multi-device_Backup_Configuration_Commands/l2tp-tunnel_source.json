    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn L2TP hot backup scenarios, when an L2TP traffic protection tunnel is used to bypass traffic, traffic volume increases. As a result, network congestion occurs. To resolve this issue, run the l2tp-tunnel source command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the l2tp-tunnel source command is run, the source interface route bound to the RBS is updated based on the link status on the network side.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
