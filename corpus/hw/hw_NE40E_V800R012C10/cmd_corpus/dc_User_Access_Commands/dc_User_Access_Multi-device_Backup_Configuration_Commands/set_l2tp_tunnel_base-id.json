    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Router assigns an integer value as an L2TP tunnel ID and the ID starts with 1. In the dual-system hot backup load balancing scenario, tunnel information is backed up between the master and slave Routers. During backup, identical tunnel IDs may exist on a single Router. The set l2tp tunnel base-id  command can be used to specify a base value that one Router uses to allocate tunnel IDs (Tunnel ID = Base value + Index starting with 1). The other Router uses the default base value 0. The settings ensure to a certain extent that each tunnel ID is unique on a single Router.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a tunnel ID carried in backup information is the same as a local tunnel ID, the Router deletes the existing local tunnel information and accepts the backup tunnel information.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe set l2tp tunnel base-id  command cannot be used on the Router that has established L2TP tunnels and allocated tunnel IDs."
