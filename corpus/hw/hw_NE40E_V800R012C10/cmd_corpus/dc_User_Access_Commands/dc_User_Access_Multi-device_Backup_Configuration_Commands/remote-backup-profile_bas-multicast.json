    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a multicast UP dual-device hot backup scenario, an RBP must be configured. After an RBP is created, you must bind the RBP to an interface so that the RBP is applied to the interface. To bind an RBP to an interface, run the remote-backup-profile bas-multicast command.\nPrerequisites\nThe UP mode of a device has been enabled using the cu-agent command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
