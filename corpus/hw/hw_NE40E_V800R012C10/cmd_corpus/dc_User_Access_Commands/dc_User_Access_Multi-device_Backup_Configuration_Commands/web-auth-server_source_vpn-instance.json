    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn N:1 RUI scenarios, the mapping between the address pool and BAS-IP address on the web authentication server must be specified for each pair of master and slave devices. An IP address pool, however, is shared only between the master and slave devices. Therefore, each pair of master and slave devices must have a source IP address to communicate with the web authentication server. To specify the source IP address of portal packets sent by the device to the web authentication server as the BAS-IP address used independently by the web authentication server, run the web-auth-server source command. In actual applications, the specified source IP address must already exist on the device, and the route to this IP address must be reachable.\nWhen the source IP address is used to access the web authentication server, a VPN attribute can be specified. If vpn-instance is not specified, the address is a public one.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nBefore running the web-auth-server source command, a loopback interface must have been created, with the IP address the same as specified in the web-auth-server source command, and the route to the loopback interface's IP address must be reachable. The loopback interface's IP address cannot be used in other service applications."
