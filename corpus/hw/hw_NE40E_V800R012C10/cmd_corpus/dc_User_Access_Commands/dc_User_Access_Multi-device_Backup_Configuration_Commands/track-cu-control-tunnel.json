    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a VE access UP dual-device hot backup scenario, if the channel between the vBRAS-UP and vBRAS-CP fails, the VE interface cannot detect the fault and therefore does not switch traffic to the secondary link. You can run this command to enable a VE interface to track channel faults so that the VE interface status can be associated with the channel status. When a channel is faulty, the VE interface goes Down to trigger a switchover.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
