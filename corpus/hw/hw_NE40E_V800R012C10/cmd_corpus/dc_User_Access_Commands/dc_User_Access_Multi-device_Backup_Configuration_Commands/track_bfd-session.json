    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nUsers can configure the remote backup service to track the BFD session status using the track bfd-session command to quickly monitor the peer status.\nAfter the configuration is finished, the remote backup service terminates the TCP connection and attempts to establish the connection if the tracked BFD session is Down. If the connection is established successfully, the data are synchronized. If the connection fails to be established, the remote backup service attempts to establish the connection until the link recovers.\nPrerequisites\nBefore using this command, create the peer BFD session on the network side of master and slave devices.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
