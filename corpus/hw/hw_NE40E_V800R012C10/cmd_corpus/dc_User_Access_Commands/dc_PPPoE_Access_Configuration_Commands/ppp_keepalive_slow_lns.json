    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf board hardware is faulty, run the ppp keepalive slow lns command on boards to send PPP echo packets of LNS users to the CPU for processing.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the ppp keepalive slow lns command is configured, PPP echo packets of LNS users are sent to the CPU for processing. However, this may consume many CPU resources and lead to DoS attack on the CPU. Therefore, configuring this command is not recommended."
