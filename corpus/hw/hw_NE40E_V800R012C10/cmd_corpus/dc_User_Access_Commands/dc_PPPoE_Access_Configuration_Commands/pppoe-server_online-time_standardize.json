    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a PPPoE/PPPoEv6 user goes online, the Ack packet sent to the terminal is lost. When the terminal retransmits an IPCP/IPv6CP Configure-Request packet, the accounting start time is incorrect. To enable accounting time alignment for PPPoE users, run the pppoe-server online-time standardize command. After accounting time alignment is enabled, the IPCP/IPv6CP renegotiation is initiated in 30s. The newly negotiated time is used to correct the Acct-Session-Time and Event-Timestamp attributes as well as the user online duration in RADIUS accounting-stop and RADIUS real-time accounting packets.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
