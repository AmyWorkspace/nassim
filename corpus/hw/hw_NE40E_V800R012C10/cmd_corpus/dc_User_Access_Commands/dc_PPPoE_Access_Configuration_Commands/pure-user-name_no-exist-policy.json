    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA user name can have a pure user name and a domain name. For example, in the user name test@adsl, test is the pure user name, and adsl is the domain name. By default, if the pure user name is empty but the complete user name is not empty, users are not allowed to go online. To allow users whose pure user name is empty but the complete user name is not empty to go online, run the pure-user-name no-exist-policyonline command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nIf the undo radius-server user-name domain-included command has been run in the RADIUS server group so that the user name sent to the RADIUS server does not carry the domain name, the RADIUS request packets do not carry the User-Name(1) attribute, because no user name is available to be sent for users with empty pure user names."
