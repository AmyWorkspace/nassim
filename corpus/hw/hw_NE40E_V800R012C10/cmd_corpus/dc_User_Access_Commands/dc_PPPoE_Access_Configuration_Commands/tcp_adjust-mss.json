    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMSS is the maximum size of a packet that can be sent in a TCP session. After a TCP session is established, the local end and the peer end send their MSS values to each other.\nIf the MSS is set, the maximum length of an IP packet is the total of MSS, length of the IP header (20 bytes), and length of the TCP header (20 bytes). The maximum length of an IP packet is also limited by the MTU; therefore, if calculated maximum length exceeds the MTU, the packet is fragmented. To improve the efficiency of packet transmission, it is recommended to set a large TCP MSS value, but ensure that the packets will not be fragmented.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
