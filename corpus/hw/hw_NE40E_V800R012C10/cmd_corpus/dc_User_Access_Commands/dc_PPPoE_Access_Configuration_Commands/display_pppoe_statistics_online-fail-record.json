    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen processing PADI or PADR packets sent by PPPoE users, the BRAS verifies the number of login PPPoE users on a board against that configured using the access-ip-limit command. If the number of login PPPoE users exceeds the specified upper limit, the system rejects new PPPoE user requests and records the statistics about such access failures. To check login failure statistics due to access IP limit(maximum number of access users), run the display pppoe statistics online-fail-record command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
