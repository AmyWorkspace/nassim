    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the mode of PPP authentication is not set for a PPPoX user in a domain, the user is authenticated in the authentication mode specified by the virtual template interface that is bound to the interface. If the mode of PPP authentication is set for a PPPoX user in a domain, the user is authenticated in the authentication mode that has been set.\nMSCHAP is the challenge handshake authentication protocol developed by Microsoft. This protocol has two versions, namely, V1 and V2.\nThe mode of PPP authentication for a PPPoX user in a domain must be the same as the authentication mode of the virtual template interface.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
