    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a CPE uses PPPoE dialup to obtain an IP address from a BRAS, the CPE can use the IP address to establish a BGP connection with the BRAS, and the BRAS can learn the BGP route from the CPE. However, traffic cannot be forwarded through the BGP route. To allow BGP route forwarding between a CPE and BRAS, run the bgp over pppoe enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter this command is run, access user information is added to information about the BGP routes with the next hops being the IP addresses of PPPoE users, allowing traffic to be forwarded through the BGP route between the CPE and BRAS.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
