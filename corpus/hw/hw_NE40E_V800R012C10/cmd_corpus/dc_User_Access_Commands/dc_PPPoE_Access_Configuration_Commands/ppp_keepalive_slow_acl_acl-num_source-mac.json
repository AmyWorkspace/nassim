    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allow a device to send PPP echo packets with a specified source MAC address to the CPU, configure ACL rules to match packets against the source MAC address and then run the ppp keepalive slow acl command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAs this command configures PPP slow reply for PPP echo packets with a specified source MAC address, the source MAC address must be specified in an ACL rule.\nIf the ppp keepalive slow acl command is run more than once in the same view, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
