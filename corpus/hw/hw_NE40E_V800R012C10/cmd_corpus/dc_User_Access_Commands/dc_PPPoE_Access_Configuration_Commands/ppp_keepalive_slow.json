    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, a BAS interface responds to PPP echo packets using hardware, which reduces the CPU burden and prevents DoS attacks. However, if the hardware fails and PPP fast relay needs to be disabled, run the ppp keepalive slow command to configure PPP slow reply.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ppp keepalive slow command is run on a BAS interface, the BAS interface sends PPP echo packets from PPP users that go online from this interface to the CPU for processing. In the case of a large volume of PPP traffic, high CPU resources will be consumed. In this situation, if the device is being attacked, the CPU processing capability becomes insufficient to process normal services and normal services are denied. Therefore, running this command is not recommended.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
