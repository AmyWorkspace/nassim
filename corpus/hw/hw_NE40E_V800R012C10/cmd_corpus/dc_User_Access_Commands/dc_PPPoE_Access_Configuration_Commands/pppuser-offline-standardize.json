    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nGenerally, the reason for user logout is fixed. To standardize the reason for PPP user logout, run the pppuser-offline-standardize command to convert the reason for PPP user logout caused by a handshake failure to the standard user logout reason. Specifically, the standard reason for user logout is that the user is proactively logged out or data transmission, and the reason is reported to the RADIUS server.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
