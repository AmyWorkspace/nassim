    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the device is required to negotiate MRUs for PPPoE connections as defined in relevant standards, you can run the pppoe ppp-max-payload enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf MRUs for PPPoE connections are not negotiated as defined in relevant standards, during link discovery, the device directly forwards a packet if its length is smaller than or equal to the negotiated MTU, and fragments a packet if its length is greater than the negotiated MTU.\nIf MRUs for PPPoE connections are negotiated as defined in relevant standards, during link discovery, the device negotiates a value between ppp-max-payload and interface MTU. Then the device uses the negotiated value and interface MTU configured in the VT to negotiate another value, which will be used as the MRU for the user. The smaller value between the MTU and MRU determines whether to fragment a packet. The directly forwards a packet if its length is smaller than or equal to the smaller value between the MTU and MRU, and fragments a packet if its length is greater than the smaller value between the MTU and MRU.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
