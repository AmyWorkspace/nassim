    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMOTM is a tag in a PADM packet. MOTM tag contains clock information provided by a clock server for end users. After a PPPoE session becomes active, ACs send PADM packets to end users. Terminals synchronize clock information based on information carried in MOTM tags (IP address of the NTP clock server).\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
