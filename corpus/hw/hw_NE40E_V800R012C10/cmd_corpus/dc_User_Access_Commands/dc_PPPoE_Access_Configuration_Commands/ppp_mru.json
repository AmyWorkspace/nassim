    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ppp mru command sets the MRU so that the size of the packets sent by the peer in PPP negotiation can be controlled.\nMRU indicates the packet receiving capability of an interface. That is, the peer device notifies the local device of the maximum length of PPP packets that can be received by the local device in LCP negotiation. At the end of the negotiation, the MTU is the smaller value of the MRU (the negotiated MRU) at both ends, and the values of the MERs at both ends remain unchanged. Therefore, the MTU value on the interface is not greater than that on the interface. This ensures that both communication parties can receive packets from the peer end.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
