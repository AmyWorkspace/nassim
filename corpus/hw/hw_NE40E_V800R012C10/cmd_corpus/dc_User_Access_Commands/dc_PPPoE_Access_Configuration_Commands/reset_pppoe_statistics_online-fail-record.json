    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen processing PADI or PADR packets sent by PPPoE users, the BRAS verifies the number of login PPPoE users on a board against that configured using the access-ip-limit command. If the number of login PPPoE users exceeds the specified upper limit, the system rejects new PPPoE user requests and records the statistics about such access failures. To clear login failure statistics due to access IP limit (maximum number of access users), run the reset pppoe statistics online-fail-record command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nAfter the reset pppoe statistics online-fail-record command is run, the system starts to collect PPPoE user login failure statistics from zero. PPPoE user login failure statistics cannot be restored after they are cleared. Exercise caution when running the command."
