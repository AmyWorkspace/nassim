    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen PPPoE users are online, if link flapping occurs and packets are replicated, the device may receive a large number of IPCP requests, triggering frequent IPCP renegotiation. This causes high CPU usage and affects device performance.\nTo prevent this problem, run the pppoe-server negotiation times limit command to limit the number of times for interface boards to receive IPCP negotiation packets. Then the device will calculate IPCP Request, NAK, and Reject packets from each user. If the device receives any type of the IPCP Request, NAK, and Reject packets for ten times from a user, the device considers the packets invalid and discards them, and subsequently terminates the IPCP negotiation with the user.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
