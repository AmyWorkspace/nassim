If EAP authentication needs to be triggered by sending a DHCP Discovery packet or an ARP/IP packet, run the dot1x authentication trigger command to enable the device to initiate EAP authentication. The EAP Start packet triggers the pop-up of the client interface, from where the user enters the user name and password to start the authentication.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
