    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDuring web user redirection, the https-redirect command must be run in the traffic behavior view to allow user packets that match the ACL rule with the destination port number of 443 to be sent to an interface board. This command must be used together with the access https-redirect command to implement the HTTPS redirection function.\nPrerequisites\nBefore the https-redirect command is run to redirect online users to the authentication page, ensure that the basic configuration of user login is complete.\nFollow-up Procedure\nWhen using traffic classification to define a redirection web page, run the rule command to configure the advanced ACL rule to match the destination port number (443) associated with the HTTPS address.\nPrecautions\nThe policy-based routing and BRAS redirection are mutually exclusive in one traffic behavior.In VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
