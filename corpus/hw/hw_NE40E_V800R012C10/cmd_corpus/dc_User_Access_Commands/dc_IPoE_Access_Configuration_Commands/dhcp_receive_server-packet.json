    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the NE40E changes bandwidth for online users, the DHCP server sends to the NE40E ACK packets carrying new QoS profile names. However, in most cases, the NE40E directly drops these ACK packets destined for gateways. The dhcp receive server-packet command enables the NE40E to process ACK packets proactively sent by a DHCP server when users are online.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe dhcp receive server-packet command takes effect for users who go online after you have configured this command."
