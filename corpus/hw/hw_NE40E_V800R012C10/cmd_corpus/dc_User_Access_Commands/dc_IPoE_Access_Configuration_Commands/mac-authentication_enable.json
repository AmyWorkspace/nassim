    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMAC address authentication is used to simplify web authentication. If MAC address authentication is enabled, the user for web authentication only needs to input the user name and password at the first time and the RADIUS server records the user's MAC address. When the user attempts to pass the web authentication again, the RADIUS server performs the authentication based on the users' MAC address and the user does not need to input the user name and password again.\nIn the existing network, this command is used together with the authening authen-fail online authen-domain command. If the MAC authentication fails, the user can perform the web authentication by inputing the user name and password in the re-direction domain, and then enter the authentication domain and access the network resources.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
