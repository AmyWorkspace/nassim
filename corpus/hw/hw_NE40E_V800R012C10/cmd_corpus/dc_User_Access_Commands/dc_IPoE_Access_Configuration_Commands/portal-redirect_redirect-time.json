    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRunning certain applications in the live network may lead to the deletion of the portal flag bit, leading to an exception in performing the captive portal function. Therefore, the portal-redirect command can be used to configure a captive portal timeout period to prevent this problem.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe captive portal timeout period configured in the AAA domain view takes precedence over that configured in the AAA view.\nAfter the captive portal timeout period is configured, the portal flag bit is deleted only in the following conditions:\nCaptive portal is successfully performed, and the RADIUS server delivers the attribute HW-Portal-Mode (2) to the device. The HW-Portal-Mode attribute is supported only in RADIUS Access-Accept packets and CoA-Request packets.The timeout period expires.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nIf the portal-redirect command is run in the domain or AAA view, the portal-server redirect-limit command configured in the same view fails to take effect."
