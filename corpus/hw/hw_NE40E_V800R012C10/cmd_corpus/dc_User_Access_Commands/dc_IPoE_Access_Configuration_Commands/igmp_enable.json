    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the igmp enable command is run in the interface view, users who log in through this interface will send IGMP Report packets. If the undo igmp enable command is run in the AAA domain view, the NE40E processes only IGMP Report packets sent from users in other domains. This saves resources of the NE40E and multicast source and easing their burdens.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nTo enable the NE40E to process IGMP Report packets sent from users in a specific domain, you must enable IGMP in the domain and interface through which users log in.\nThe igmp enable command takes effect on IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4/IPv6 dual stack users."
