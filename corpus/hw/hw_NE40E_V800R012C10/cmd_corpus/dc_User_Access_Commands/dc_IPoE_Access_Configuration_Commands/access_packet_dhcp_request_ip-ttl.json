    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the device functions as a user-side DHCP relay agent, it forwards DHCP Discover/Request/Release/Decline packets carrying the default TTL value of 16. However, if the device connects to the DHCP server with more than 16 hops in between, the DHCP Discover/Request/Release/Decline packets fail to be relayed to the DHCP server. As a result, users cannot obtain IP addresses. To allow the device to relay DHCP Discover/Request/Release/Decline packets to the DHCP server that is more than 16 hops away, run the access packet dhcp request ip-ttl command to set the TTL value in DHCP packets.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
