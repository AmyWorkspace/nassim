    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore enabling user access triggered by IP packets on a BAS interface, you must configure the access type of the BAS interface as Layer2 access user. After this function is enabled, online static or DHCPv4 users can also send IP packets to trigger an update of their VLAN and interface information during roaming.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nTo ensure that IP addresses are available when users are triggered to go online, you are advised to run the reserved ip-address lease command in the IPv4 address pool view to enable lease-based IP address reservation."
