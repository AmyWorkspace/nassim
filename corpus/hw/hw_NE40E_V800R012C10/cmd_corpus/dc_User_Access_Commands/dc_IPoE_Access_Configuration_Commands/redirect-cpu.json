    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the success rate for captive portal redirection is low, run the redirect-cpu portal command to configure flow-based captive portal redirection so that only packets that match the captive portal redirection list are redirected. This function improves the captive portal redirection success rate and accuracy.\nPrerequisites\nThe service-policy name portal command has been run in the system view to create a portal service policy, and the service-policy command has been run in the AAA domain view to apply the portal service policy to the domain.\nThe access requests that match UCL rules can be redirected to the portal server only when the packet type is specified as TCP and a destination port number is specified in the UCL rules. Otherwise, the access requests that match UCL rules are permitted.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter flow-based captive portal direction is configured, user access requests are matched against the UCL rules. The access requests that match the UCL rules are redirected to the portal server to implement captive portal for users.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
