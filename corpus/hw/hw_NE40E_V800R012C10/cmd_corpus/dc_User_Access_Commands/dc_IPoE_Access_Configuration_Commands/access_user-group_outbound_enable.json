    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn user-to-user scenarios, to match downstream packets against UCLs based on the source user's user-group ID, run the access user-group outbound enable command to allow downstream packets to carry the source user's user-group ID in upstream packets. By default, downstream packets do not carry the source user's user-group ID. Therefore, downstream packets cannot be matched against UCLs based on the source user's user-group ID.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
