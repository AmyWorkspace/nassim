    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device does not strictly check user packets by default. If the MAC address of the sent packets is not the one on the BAS interface, the user may still get a response. To protect the device from being attacked by malicious attacks, run the access packet strict-check command to strictly check user packets. The packets that do not comply with the standard protocol will be dropped.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you configure a strict check on user packets, the packets that do not comply with the standard protocol are dropped. Additionally, if the end device does not strictly comply with the standard protocol, some users cannot log in. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
