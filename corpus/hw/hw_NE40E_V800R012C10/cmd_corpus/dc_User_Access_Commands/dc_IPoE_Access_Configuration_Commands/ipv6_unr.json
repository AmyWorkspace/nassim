    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nConfiguring tags and using routing policies allows various user routes to be advertised to specific networks.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe ipv6 unr command takes effect globally, and routes are classified based on tags. Tag values are specified in routing policies to advertise routes to specific networks.\nThis command takes effect on routes of new access users, routes of a new IPv6 address pool, and routes of a modified IPv6 address pool. However, this command does not take effect on routes that have been advertised from a RADIUS server.\nRoute tags of different types can be configured at the same time. If a type of route has multiple tags configured, the latest configuration takes effect.\nFollow-up Procedure\nSpecify a behavior to process a route that matches a specified tag value in a routing policy. Use a routing protocol to import the routes based on the specified routing policy.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
