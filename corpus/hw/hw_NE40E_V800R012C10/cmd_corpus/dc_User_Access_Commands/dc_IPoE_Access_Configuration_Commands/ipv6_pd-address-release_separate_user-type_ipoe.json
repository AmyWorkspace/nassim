    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn IPoE access scenarios where CPEs work in numbered routing mode, the BRAS uses ND to assign IPv6 addresses to WAN interfaces on CPEs and uses PD to assign prefixes to CPEs to generate IPv6 addresses for the attached terminals. By default, the assigned PD addresses and the IPv6 addresses assigned using ND are released at the same time. To enable a device to release only the assigned PD addresses and not the IPv6 addresses assigned using ND for communicating with CPEs, run the ipv6 pd-address-release separate user-type ipoe command. After this command is run, the PD addresses can be released separately.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThis function applies to new access users only."
