    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nService packets carry 802.1p values to identify their priorities. The BRAS can identify service priorities based on the 802.1p values of received Layer 2 service packets and transmit the service packets to corresponding VPNs. To allow this, enable a BAS interface to transmit packets to different VPNs based on 802.1p priorities of the packets and also run the 802.1p binding vpn-instance command to bind a VPN instance to an 802.1p priority.\nPrerequisites\nA BAS interface has been enabled to transmit packets to different VPNs based on 802.1p priorities of the packets using the 802.1p-to-vpn command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nIf the user-VLAN sub-interface terminates two VLAN tags, services enter different VPN instances based on the 802.1p in the outer VLAN tag."
