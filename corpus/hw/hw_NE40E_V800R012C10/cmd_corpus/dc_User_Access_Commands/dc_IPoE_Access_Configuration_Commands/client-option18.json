    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the client-option18 command is run, the server trusts the information in the Option 18 field of DHCPv6 messages sent by the client and sends the information in the Option 18 field to the RADIUS server. The function of Option18 is similar to that of the Circuit ID in Option82 of DHCPv4, that is, the ID of the access line for broadband users. The carrier defines how to fill in the Option 18 field.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nAfter the BRAS device is configured with the client-option18 command, if the packets sent by the client do not carry the Option 18 information, the packets sent by the BRAS device to the remote server do not carry the Option 18 information that is generated by default."
