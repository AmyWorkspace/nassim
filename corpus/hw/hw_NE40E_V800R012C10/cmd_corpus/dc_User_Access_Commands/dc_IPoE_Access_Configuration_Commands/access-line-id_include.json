After being parsed on the , the information is carried in the RADIUS attribute and sent to the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server compares the information in the received RADIUS attribute with the physical location information stored in the database to verify if they are consistent.\nThe access-line-id include command is used to set the rule of parsing the access-line-id information.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe functions of the access-line-id include command and the option82-relay-mode include command are the same. Both of them are used to configure the RADIUS attribute to carry the access-line-id information. If they have been both run more than once in the same view, the last configuration overrides the previous one."
