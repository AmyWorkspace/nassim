    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen Layer 2 static users go online, host CAR is performed for ICMPv4 messages by default. If NQA association with framed-routes is configured, traffic will be interrupted when some ICMPv4 messages are dropped due to the host CAR configuration. To prevent traffic interruptions in such a case, run the command to disable the device from performing host CAR for ICMPv4 messages received from Layer 2 static users during the login process.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe static-user icmp-ignore-hostcar command takes effect for new Layer 2 static users only. If the static-user icmp-ignore-hostcar command or its undo form is run when users are online and attributes are delivered in CoA messages, the corresponding configuration also takes effect for the online users."
