    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn HTTPS redirection scenarios, this command must be run to select a cipher suite. Otherwise, the HTTPS redirection function is unavailable.\nThe rule for selecting a cipher suite by priority is as follows: The protocol version is determined based on the packets sent by the user. In the version scope of the corresponding protocol, the cipher suite with earlier configuration is selected at a higher priority.\nIf multiple cipher suites are supported, for example, if the cipher-suite support 002f 0035 c02f 1301 1302 command is run, a cipher suite is selected by priority based on the following rules:If the protocol version is TLS1.3, a cipher suite is selected among the ones supported only in TLS1.3. In this case, the cipher suites that take effect on the device are TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 in order (from high priority to low priority). If TLS1.3 does not match, the cipher suites of degraded TLS versions can be selected based on the supported_versions extension option carried in packets.If the protocol version is TLS1.2, a cipher suite is selected among the ones supported only in TLS1.2. In this case, the cipher suites that take effect on the device are TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA, and TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (from high priority to low priority).\n\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command applies only to the admin VS.The cipher suites 002f and 0035 provide low security levels. Other cipher suites are recommended.TLS1.2 cipher suites:Cipher suites are selected in the following priority sequence based on security stength: c02f > 0035 >002f\nCipher suites are selected in the following priority sequence based on redirection performance: 002f > 0035 > c02f.\nTLS1.3 cipher suite:Cipher suites are selected in the following priority sequence based on security stength: 1302 > 1301\nCipher suites are selected in the following priority sequence based on redirection performance: 1301 > 1302."
