    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf multiple users bound to VPN instances exist on a BAS interface and VPN instance-based user traffic statistics collection is enabled on the BAS interface, you can run the display access statistics interface command to check statistics about user packets and users based on a specified VPN instance on the BAS interface.\nPrerequisites\nVPN instance-based user traffic statistics collection is enabled on the BAS interface using the access user-flow-statistics enable command.\nPrecautions\nThe number of users queried using the display access statistics interface command is the number of users who start accounting."
