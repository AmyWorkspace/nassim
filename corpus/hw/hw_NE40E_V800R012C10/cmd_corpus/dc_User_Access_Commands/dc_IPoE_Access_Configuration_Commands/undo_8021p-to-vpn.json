    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nService packets carry 802.1p values to identify their priorities. The BRAS can identify service priorities based on the 802.1p values of received Layer 2 service packets and transmit the service packets to corresponding VPNs. To allow this, run the 802.1p-to-vpn command to enable a BAS interface to transmit packets to different VPNs based on 802.1p priorities of the packets, and also bind VPN instances to different 802.1p priorities.\nPrerequisites\nLayer 2 subscriber access has been configured for the BAS interface using the access-type layer2-subscriber command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the 802.1p binding vpn-instance command to bind a VPN instance to an 802.1p priority.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
