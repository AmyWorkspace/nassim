    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the user information of an online IPv4 user is changed, the Option 82 information carried in a Discover packet, Request packet, or lease renewal packet sent by the new user will be different from that carried in such packets used for login of the old user. However, the new user is not logged out. To enable a device to log out a user and re-initiate a login authentication procedure in the preceding scenario, run the dhcp option82-mismatch action offline command. After the command is run, the device replies with a NAK message in response to such a Discover packet, Request packet, or lease renewal packet and starts the user logout process. The new user needs to be re-authenticated at a user login attempt. For dual-stack users in the preceding scenario, a device logs out a new dual-stack user only when the Option 82 information in a Discover packet, Request packet, or lease renewal packet of an IPv4 user is changed.\nPrerequisites\nLayer 2 user access has been configured using the access-type layer2-subscriber or access-type layer2-leased-line command in the BAS interface view.\nThe function to trust the access-line-id information has been enabled using the client-option82 command. Otherwise, the dhcp option82-mismatch action offline command configuration does not take effect.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe dhcp option82-mismatch action offline and access-line-id update online commands cannot be both run in the same bas interface view."
