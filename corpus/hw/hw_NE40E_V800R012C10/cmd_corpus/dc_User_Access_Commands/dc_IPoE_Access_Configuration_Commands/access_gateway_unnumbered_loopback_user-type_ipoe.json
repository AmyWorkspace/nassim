    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nGenerally, a RADIUS server delivers IP addresses in the domain address pool to common DHCP Layer 2 users. If the delivered IP addresses are not in the domain address pool, users cannot go online. To enable common DHCP Layer 2 users to go online with IP addresses delivered by the RADIUS server but not in the domain address pool, run the access gateway unnumbered loopback user-type ipoe command to enable gateway unnumbered first.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nGateway unnumbered is enabled on a loopback interface using the access gateway unnumbered command in the loopback interface view."
