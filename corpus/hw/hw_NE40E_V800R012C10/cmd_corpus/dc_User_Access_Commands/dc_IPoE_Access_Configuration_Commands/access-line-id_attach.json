The Option 82 information sent by the BRAS is the Option 82 field content in user packets.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the BRAS sends Option 82 information to the RADIUS server only when user packets carry the Option 82 field and the BRAS trusts the Option 82 field in user packets. The Option 82 information sent by the BRAS is the Option 82 field content in user packets.\nAfter the access-line-id attach command is run, the BRAS sends Option 82 information to the RADIUS server, irrespective of whether user packets carry the Option 82 field or the BRAS trusts the Option 82 field in user packets.\nFor IPoE users, the BRAS sends Option 82 information that it constructs to the RADIUS server.For PPPoE users, the BRAS sends Option 82 information carried in user packets to the RADIUS server if the user packets carry the Option 82 field; the BRAS sends the empty Option 82 field to the RADIUS server if the user packets do not carry the Option 82 field.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
