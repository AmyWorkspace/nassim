    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a Layer 2 user access scenario where a BRAS is required to log out online DHCPv6 users, to allow clients to detect user logouts immediately after users are offline so that the clients can re-dial up for login, run the access dhcpv6-reconfigure command to enable the BRAS to send Reconfigure messages to clients. To configure the number of retransmissions of DHCPv6 Reconfigure messages to clients, run the retransmit times command. If no response is received from a client after the specified number of retransmissions is reached, the device no longer sends a Reconfigure message to the client.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThis configuration takes effect only for users to whom no Reconfigure message is sent."
