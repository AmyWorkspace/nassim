This port number must be the same as the destination port number of the portal packets sent by the web authentication server. The port number must be globally unique, that is, all the web authentication servers use the same port number.\nThe undo web-auth-server listening-port command removes the configuration of the port number used to receive Portal packets.\nBy default, the port number is 2000.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the device exchanges packets with the web server, you need to configure the number of the port on the device for receiving Portal packets from a web authentication server. This port number must be the same as the destination port number of the portal packets sent by the web authentication server. The port number must be globally unique, that is, all the web authentication servers use the same port number.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nIf web authentication is not enabled using the web-auth-server enable command, you need to check whether the port number specified using the web-auth-server listening-port number command is used."
