    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe access-delay odd-even command works together with the access-delay command to configure a response delay policy for access users with odd and even MAC addresses. By default, the system uses the least significant bit to determine the parity of a MAC address. To allow the system to determine the parity of a MAC address based on the bit after an offset value, run the access-delay odd-even command to configure a MAC address offset.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe access-delay odd-even command can be run only when the access type on a BAS interface is set to layer2-subscriber or layer2-leased-line."
