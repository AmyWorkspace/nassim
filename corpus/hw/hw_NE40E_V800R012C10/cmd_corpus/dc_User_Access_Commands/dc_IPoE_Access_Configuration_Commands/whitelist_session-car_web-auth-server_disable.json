    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Portal session CAR function is enabled by default. It isolates packet channels between Portal sessions, preventing packets over different Portal sessions from preempting bandwidth resources. To disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car web-auth-server disable command. Portal packets received by this device will then be sent directly through the Portal-specific CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of Portal packets, packets from different Portal sessions preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not usually recommended.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS. \nAfter the whitelist session-car web-auth-server disable command is run on a device to disable the Portal session CAR function, packets from different Portal sessions preempt bandwidth resources if the device receives a large number of Portal packets. Therefore, disabling this function is not usually recommended."
