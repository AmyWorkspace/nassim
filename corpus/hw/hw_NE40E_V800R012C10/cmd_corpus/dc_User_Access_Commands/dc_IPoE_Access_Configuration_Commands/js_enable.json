    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the HTTPS noise reduction function is enabled, upon receipt of an HTTPS Get packet, the BRAS replies with a 200 OK packet indicating the insertion of the JavaScript script. Upon receipt of the 200 OK packet, the browser executes the JavaScript script and sends the BRAS a HTTPS Get packet carrying a special URL. One second later, the browser redirects to the specified portal server. A non-browser does not execute the JavaScript script upon receipt of the 200 OK packet.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nTo enable the function of inserting a JavaScript script during web redirection, run the web-server mode post command in the domain view.Client browsers must be enabled with the JavaScript function."
