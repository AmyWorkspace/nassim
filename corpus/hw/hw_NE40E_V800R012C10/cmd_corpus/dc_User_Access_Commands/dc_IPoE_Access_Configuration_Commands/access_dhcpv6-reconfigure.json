    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a DHCPv6 user access scenario where a BRAS is required to log out online users, to allow clients to detect user logouts immediately after users are offline so that the clients can re-dial up for login, run the access dhcpv6-reconfigure command to enable the BRAS to send Reconfigure messages to clients.\nPrecautions\nThis function applies only to IPoEv6 users.The access dhcpv6-reconfigure command enables the DHCPv6 Reconfigure function globally. However, in the scenario where the dhcp coa-zero-lease dhcpv6-enhance layer2 command is run in the AAA domain view and a dual-stack user is online from both stacks, the BRAS sends Reconfigure messages to the user only when the user is logged out from the IPv6 stack after the RADIUS server delivers a zero lease in a COA message.If users go online with IPv6 addresses assigned from a remote address pool, the BRAS cannot send Reconfigure messages to clients."
