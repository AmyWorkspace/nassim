    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore enabling ARP packet-triggered user login on a BAS interface, you must configure the access type as layer2-subscriber. To enable the function, run the arp-trigger command. After this function is enabled, online users can also send ARP packets to trigger an update of their VLAN and interface information during roaming.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nTo ensure that IP addresses are available when users are triggered to go online, you are advised to run the reserved ip-address lease command in the IPv4 address pool view to enable lease-based IP address reservation."
