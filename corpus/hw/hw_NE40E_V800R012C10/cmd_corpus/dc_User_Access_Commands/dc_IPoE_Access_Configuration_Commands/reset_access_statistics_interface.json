    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf multiple users bound to VPN instances exist on a BAS interface, you can run the display access statistics interface command to check statistics about user packets and users. If a large number of such historical statistics exist on the device, it is inconvenient for analysis. To clear statistics about user packets based on a specified BAS interface and VPN instance, run the reset access statistics flow interface command. Then you can run the display access statistics interface command to view new statistics.\nPrecautions\nThe cleared statistics cannot be restored. Therefore, exercise caution when you perform this operation.\nThe reset access statistics flow interface command clears statistics about user packets on the master main control board only.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
