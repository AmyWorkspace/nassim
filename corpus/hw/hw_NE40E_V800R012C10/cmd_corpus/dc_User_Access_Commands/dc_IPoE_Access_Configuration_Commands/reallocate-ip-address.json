    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCurrently, many PCs do not need to be authenticated and can be connected to the network. If public IP addresses are allocated to PCs after the PCs start, IP addresses will be wasted. With IP address reallocation, the NE40E allocates a private address to a user who is not authenticated, and then allocates a public address to a user who is authenticated. This solves the problem that public addresses are insufficient, and improves public address usage.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe reallocate-ip-address command is used only for Web users.\nAfter the command is executed in a domain, you can run the display domain command to check the value of the Realloc-IP-attribute field to determine whether IP address reallocation is enabled in the domain.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe address reassignment function requires a web server to comply with Huawei's proprietary protocol for address reassignment and a client to download the plug-in through the web server."
