    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMultiple well-known websites currently use the secure HTTPS protocol. When users access the websites using HTTPS, they need to pass web authentication. To allow users who have not passed web authentication to access the websites using HTTPS, run the access https-redirect command. In this case, devices can redirect the users to the web authentication page, and users can properly access the websites after web authentication succeeds.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the access-https-redirect command is run, the access-https-redirect view can be created. Users can run HTTPS-related commands in the access-https-redirect view.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS. \nWhen user access to an HTTPS website triggers web authentication, a warning message is displayed. The user needs to click Continue to complete web authentication.Redirection cannot be performed on browsers or websites using HSTS.If the destination port number of the HTTPS request packets sent by a user is not a well-known port number, such as port 443, redirection fails to be performed.When the access https-redirect command is run, you also need to run the https-redirect command in the flow behavior view to implement the function to send HTTPS packets.The client must support TLS1.2 or a later version. Otherwise, HTTPS redirection fails to performed."
