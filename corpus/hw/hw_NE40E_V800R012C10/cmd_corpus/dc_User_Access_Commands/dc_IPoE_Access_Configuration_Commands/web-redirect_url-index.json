    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can dynamically redirect users to a URL as required. For example, when a user is detected attacking the network, you can forcibly redirect the user to a URL. To be specific, you can configure indexes of different URLs in BOD so that attackers can be forcibly redirected to corresponding URLs. Currently, the triggering condition is that the policy server delivers BOD whose service ID is all Fs.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
