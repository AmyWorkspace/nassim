    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen IPv6 addresses are assigned from a remote IPv6 address pool, the device is disabled from inserting the self-defined Option 18 attribute into a Relay-forward message to be sent to the DHCPv6 server by default. To enable the device to insert the self-defined Option 18 attribute into a Relay-forward message to be sent to the DHCPv6 server, run the dhcpv6 option-18 rebuild self-define send-to-server command. After this command is run, the device inserts the Option 18 attribute based on the following format:\nFormat of the Option 18 attribute: interface description:outer VLAN ID.inner VLAN ID\nInterface description (interface ID) supports self-defined character strings.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe dhcpv6 option-18 rebuild self-define send-to-server command takes effect in real time. The contents of the Option 18 attribute inserted in the Relay-forward messages sent to the DHCPv6 server are different before and after the configurations are added or deleted.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe dhcpv6 option-18 rebuild self-define send-to-server command is configured in the BAS interface view, whereas the dhcpv6 relay option-insert interface-id mode { cn-telecom | tr-101 } and dhcpv6 relay option-insert mode type1 commands are configured in the interface view. If the commands configured in the two views are both run, the command configured in the BAS interface view takes effect."
