    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen receiving the DHCPv6 Solicit packet from an online user terminal, the device forces the user to go offline and waits until the user sends a DHCPv6 Solicit packet to obtain the address through DHCPv6.\nIf a user terminal that does not support retransmission of DHCPv6 Solicit packets is quickly restarted, the device cannot detect the user logout event. In this case, you need to run the dhcpv6 through-packet command to enable transparent transmission of DHCPv6 packets so that the user can normally log in to the device. After this command is run, the device replies with a user packet after receiving a Solicit packet from an online user, instead of logging out the user.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
