    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe DHCPv6 session CAR function is enabled by default. It isolates packet channels between DHCPv6 sessions, preventing packets over different DHCPv6 sessions from preempting bandwidth resources. To disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car dhcpv6-server disable command. DHCPv6 packets received by this device will then be sent directly through the DHCPv6-specific CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of DHCPv6 packets, packets from different DHCPv6 sessions preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not usually recommended.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
