    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a DHCPv6 client that uses an IPv6 address assigned by the device detects that the address is used by another client on the same network segment, the DHCPv6 client sends a DHCPv6 Decline message to the device. Once the device receives the DHCPv6 Decline message, it automatically sets the IPv6 address to the conflict state and will not assign it to clients. The reset conflict-ip-address command resets the conflict state of the IPv6 address. Then, the device can assign the address to a client.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
