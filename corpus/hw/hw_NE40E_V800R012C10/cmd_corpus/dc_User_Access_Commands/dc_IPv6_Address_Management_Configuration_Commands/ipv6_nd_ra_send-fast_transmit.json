    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn DHCPv6 access scenarios, by default, the device sends RA packets in response to RS packets and also actively sends RA packets at an interval of 20 minutes. If a CPE does not actively send RS packets, users attached to the CPE cannot learn the gateway route after going online. To resolve this problem, run the ipv6 nd ra send-fast transmit command so that the device actively sends RA packets immediately after users go online.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe device actively sends RA packets immediately after DHCPv6 users go online from the BAS interface, irrespectively whether the CPE to which the DHCPv6 users are attached sends RS packets or not.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
