    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf you want the device to allocate addresses or prefixes for users, run this command to bind an IPv6 prefix pool to an IPv6 address pool.\nPrerequisites\nBefore binding a prefix pool to an address pool, you must run the ipv6 prefix command to create the prefix pool.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nA prefix pool can be bound to only one address pool. Similarly, an address pool can be bound to only one prefix pool. The binding between address pools and prefix pools follows.\nUser-side local address pool: The prefix pool for binding can be the local prefix pool.User-side delegation address pool: The prefix pool for binding can be the delegation prefix pool.User-side relay address pool: The prefix pool for binding can be the local prefix pool.User-side remote address pool: The prefix pool for binding can be the remote prefix pool.\nDifferent prefix pools are used for different address allocation modes:\nThe local prefix pool is configured when the WAN interface address is allocated in ND prefix allocation or DHCPv6 IA_NA mode.The delegation prefix pool is configured when the LAN interface prefix is allocated in ND prefix allocation or DHCPv6 PD mode.The remote prefix pool is configured when the address or prefix is allocated by the remote server in DHCPv6 IA_NA/IA_PD mode.\nIf an IPv6 address pool is bound to a domain, the IPv6 prefix pool bound to the IPv6 address pool cannot be modified or deleted."
