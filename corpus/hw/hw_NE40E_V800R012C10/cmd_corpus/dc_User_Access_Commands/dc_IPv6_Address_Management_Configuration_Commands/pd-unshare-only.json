    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the delegation prefix pools for ND prefix allocation need to be differentiated with the delegation prefix pools for DHCPv6 IA_PD prefix allocation on a device, run the slaac-unshare-only command and the pd-unshare-only command in the corresponding delegation prefix pools.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the pd-unshare-only command is run for a delegation prefix pool, this prefix pool can be used only for DHCPv6 IA_PD prefix allocation and is preferred in DHCPv6 IA_PD prefix allocation.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nMultiple address pools can be configured in a domain, and the address pool with the highest priority is preferred. A remote prefix pool configured only for DHCPv6 prefix or address allocation has a priority over that without the preceding configuration."
