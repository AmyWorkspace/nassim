    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn certain situations, for example, when a DHCPv6 client still maintains the IPv6 address allocated last time, the client can obtain the IPv6 address through a rapid two-message exchange if the Solicit message sent from the client contains the Rapid Commit option and the server also supports the option. The dhcpv6 rapid-commit command enables the server to support the Rapid Commit option.\nThis command run in the system view allows all DHCPv6 clients with the Rapid Commit option to obtain IPv6 addresses through a rapid two-message exchange. Without this command run in the system view, the dhcpv6 rapid-commit command configured in the view of the IPv6 address pool allocated by the client determines whether to use a rapid two-message exchange.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
