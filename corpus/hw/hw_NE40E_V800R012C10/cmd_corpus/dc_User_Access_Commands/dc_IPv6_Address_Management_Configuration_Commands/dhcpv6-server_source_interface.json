    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allow the DHCPv6 servers and device to exchange packets with a specified IP address, run the dhcpv6-server source command to configure the device to send packets with a specified source IP address to the DHCPv6 server group.\nPrerequisites\nA link address has been configured using the link-address command in the IPv6 address prefix view.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only on the admin VS.\nIt is recommended that you use the loopback interface's IP address as the source IP address of packets sent to the DHCPv6 server group. This ensures stable routes."
