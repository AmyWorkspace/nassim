    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure upper and lower IPv6 address alarm thresholds for service boards, run the access ipv6-address slot-warning-threshold command. When the percentage of the number of IPv6 addresses of access users on a service board in the IPv6 specification for the board exceeds the upper alarm threshold or goes below the lower alarm threshold, the device generates an alarm for the board.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
