    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the device serves as a DHCPv6 relay, If a client is powered off or has gone offline unexpectedly, the device cannot sense that the client is offline, because the client does not send any Release packet. As a result, the remote ipv6 prefix pool does not release the IP address used by the client. To prevent this problem, enable the lease management function for the remote ipv6 prefix pool.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the lease management function for the remote ipv6 prefix pool is enabled, it takes effect for offline users immediately when they go online. In addition, it takes effect for online users when they successfully renew their leases for the next time. After the lease management function for the remote ipv6 prefix pool is disabled, it takes effect for online users immediately and takes effect for offline users after they go online again.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
