    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the device does not manage the leases of RADIUS-delivered IPv6 addresses that are not in the supported address pools. Management on users' IPv6 address leases depends only on the user client. If the client fails, the device is unaware of user address lease expiry. To enable the device to manage the leases of RADIUS-delivered IPv6 addresses that are not in the supported address pools, run the\naccess frame-ipv6 lease manage pool-exclude command. The device then deletes the entries of users whose leases expire and are not renewed, log them out, and displays the logout reason as lease expiry.To enable the device to manage the leases of RADIUS-delivered IPv6 addresses that are in the supported address pools, run the frame-ipv6 lease manage command in the IPv6 prefix pool view.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
