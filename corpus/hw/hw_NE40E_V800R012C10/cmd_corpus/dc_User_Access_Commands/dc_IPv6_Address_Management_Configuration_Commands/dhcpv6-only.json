    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the remote prefix pools for ND prefix allocation need to be differentiated with the remote prefix pools for DHCPv6 prefix or address allocation on a device, run the slaac-unshare-only command and the dhcpv6-only command in the corresponding remote prefix pools.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the dhcpv6-only command is run for a remote prefix pool, this prefix pool can be used only for DHCPv6 prefix or address allocation and is preferred in DHCPv6 prefix allocation.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
