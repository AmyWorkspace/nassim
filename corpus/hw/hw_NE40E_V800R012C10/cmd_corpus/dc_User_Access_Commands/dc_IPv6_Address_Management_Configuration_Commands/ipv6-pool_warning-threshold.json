    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an alarm threshold for the address usage of the IPv6 address pools bound to a VPN instance, run the ipv6-pool warning-threshold command so that the device generates an alarm when the IPv6 address usage reaches the threshold. This prompts the administrator to plan addresses to prevent user login failures due to address exhaustion.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
