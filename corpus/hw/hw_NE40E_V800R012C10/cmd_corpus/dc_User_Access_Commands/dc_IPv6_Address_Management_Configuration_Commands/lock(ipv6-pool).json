    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe IPv6 address pool whose addresses are being used cannot be deleted. To delete an IPv6 address pool, you need to run the lock command in the view of the IPv6 address pool to lock it and then delete it after all online users are logged out.\nAfter an IPv6 address pool is locked, its associated IPv6 prefix pool is disabled and cannot be used to assign IPv6 prefixes and DNS server addresses. In this case, you can use the undo lock command to unlock the IPv6 address pool.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nUsers whose IP addresses are delivered by the RADIUS server from a locked address pool or whose prefixes are locked are not allowed to go online. If the users have gone online, they can renew the lease in this scenario."
