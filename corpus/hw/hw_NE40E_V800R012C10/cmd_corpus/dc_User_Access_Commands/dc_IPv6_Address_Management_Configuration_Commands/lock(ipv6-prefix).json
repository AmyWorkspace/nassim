    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe IPv6 prefix pool whose prefixes are being used cannot be deleted. To delete an IPv6 prefix pool, you need to run the lock command in the view of the IPv6 prefix pool and then delete it after all online users are logged out.\nIPv6 prefixes in the locked IPv6 prefix pool cannot be assigned to clients. The clients can keep on using the IPv6 addresses or prefixes already assigned to them. Further requests on the already assigned IPv6 addresses or prefixes, such as renewing the lease, however, will be rejected. After the undo lock command is used, IPv6 addresses or prefixes can be assigned and further requests can be replied as normal.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
