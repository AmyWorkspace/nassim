    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ipv6 ppp assign-interfaceid command can be used to configure the device to allocate interface IDs, allowing carriers to manage interface IDs in a centralized manner.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nWhen a RADIUS server allocates interface IDs, users must accept the allocated interface IDs. If they do not accept the interface IDs, IPv6CP negotiation will fail."
