    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device allocates an IPv6 address for the WAN interface and an AFTR name to the CPE. The CPE then sends the AFTR name to its connected DNS server for a resolution. The DNS server resolves the AFTR name into an IPv6 address and sends this IPv6 address to the CPE.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nAn AFTR name can be configured in the AAA domain or IPv6 address pool view or delivered by the RADIUS server. An AFTR name configured in the AAA domain view has a higher priority than that configured in the IPv6 address pool view but has a lower priority than that delivered by the RADIUS server."
