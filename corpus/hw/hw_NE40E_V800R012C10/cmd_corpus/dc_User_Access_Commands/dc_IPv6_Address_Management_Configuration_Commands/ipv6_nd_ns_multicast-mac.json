    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn some scenarios, terminals do not support the IPv6 address in an NS message as a multicast address, and the destination MAC address is a unicast or broadcast MAC address. As a result, the static users bound to the interface for IPv6 proactive protection fail to go online. To configure the destination MAC address in NS messages as a multicast MAC address, run the ipv6 nd ns multicast-mac command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe destination MAC address in the NS messages sent by the static users bound to the interface for IPv6 proactive detection is changed to an IPv6 multicast MAC address.\nPrecautions\nThis command applies only to IPv6 proactive detection on static users."
