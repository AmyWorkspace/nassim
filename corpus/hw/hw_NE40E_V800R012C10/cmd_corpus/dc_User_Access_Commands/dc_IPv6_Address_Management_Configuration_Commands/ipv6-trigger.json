    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a static user or a DHCPv6 user is logged off unexpectedly, run the ipv6-trigger command on a BAS interface to allow the user to go online based on the IPv6 packets sent by the user or allow online users to send IPv6 packets to trigger an update of their VLAN and interface information during roaming.\nPrerequisites\nThe access type of the BAS interface is configured to be Layer2 access.\nPrecautions\nTo ensure that IPv6 addresses are available when users are triggered to go online, you are advised to run the reserved ipv6-address command in the IPv6 prefix pool view to enable lease-based IPv6 address reservation."
