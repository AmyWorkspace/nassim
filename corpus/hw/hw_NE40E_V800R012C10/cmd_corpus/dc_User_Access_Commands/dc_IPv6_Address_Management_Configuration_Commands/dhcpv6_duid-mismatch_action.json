    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a scenario where an IPoE user has different DHCPv6 DUIDs, for example, a PC runs different operating systems, after the user goes online through one DUID and then attempts to go online through the other DUID, the device by default discards the DHCPv6 request packet carrying the other DUID, causing the user to fail to go online. The user can go online through the other DUID only after the user is detected offline through the first DUID.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the device receives a DHCPv6 request packet, it forcibly logs out the user through the first DUID, so that the user can use the other DUID to go online again.\nThis command affects only users whose DHCPv6 request packets have the same physical location information (access interface and VLAN). If the received DHCPv6 request packet carries a different DUID and different physical location information (access interface and VLAN) as that of an online user with the same MAC address, the device directly discards the DHCPv6 request packet.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
