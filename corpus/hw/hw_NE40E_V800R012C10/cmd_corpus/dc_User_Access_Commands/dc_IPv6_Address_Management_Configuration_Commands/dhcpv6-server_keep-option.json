    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn DHCPv6 relay scenarios, the BRAS discards options carried in response packets sent from DHCPv6 servers to clients. To allow clients to receive a specified option, run the dhcpv6-server keep-option command to enable the BRAS to transparently transmit the option in response packets from DHCPv6 servers to clients.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the dhcpv6-server keep-option command is run, the BRAS transparently transmits only the specified option. Other options are discarded.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
