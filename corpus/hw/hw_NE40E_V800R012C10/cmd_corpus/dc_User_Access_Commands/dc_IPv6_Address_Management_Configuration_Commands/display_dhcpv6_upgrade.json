    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the device to be upgraded have DHCPv6 users, run the dhcpv6 upgrade command to modify leases of these users to a shorter period, so that DHCPv6 users can get online by sending renewal packets after the device is restarted after the upgrade.\nThe dhcpv6 upgrade command cannot be saved to the configuration file. You need to run the display dhcpv6 upgrade command to view the dhcpv6 upgrade command configuration. Then you can calculate the restart time of the device based on the number of users with old leases and maximum remaining time for users with old leases to send renewal packets.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
