    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDuring 802.1X authentication, the BRAS sends an EAP-Request/Identity packet to the client. If the client does not respond with an EAP-Response/Identity packet after the timeout period elapses, the BRAS can repeatedly send EAP-Request/Identity packets to the client. To set the number of and timeout period for EAP-Request/Identity packet retransmissions, run the request command. If the client does not respond with an EAP-Response/Identity packet after packet retransmissions reach the specified number, the user is logged out.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
