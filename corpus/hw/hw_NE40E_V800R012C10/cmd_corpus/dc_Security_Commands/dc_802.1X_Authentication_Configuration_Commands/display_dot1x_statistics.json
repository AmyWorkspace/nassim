    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo view statistics about packets exchanged between user terminals and the device, run the display dot1x statistics command. The command output helps verify the 802.1X configuration and locate 802.1X faults.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter this command is run, you can check 802.1X packet statistics to identify abnormal packets. After faults are identified, run the reset dot1x statistics command to clear existing statistics. The system then starts to collect 802.1X packet statistics from zero. After a specified period elapses, run the display dot1x statistics command to check whether abnormal packets persist and determine whether faults are rectified,run the display dot1x statistics command to check whether abnormal packets persist and determine whether faults are rectified.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
