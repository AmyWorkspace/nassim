    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter 802.1X authentication is enabled on an interface, a user device connected to the interface can access the network only after being authenticated. If authentication fails, the user device cannot access the network, which improves network security. To enable 802.1X authentication on an interface, run the dot1x enable command.\nPrecautions\nThe dot1x enable command cannot be run on Eth-Trunk member interfaces. Interfaces enabled with 802.1X authentication cannot be added to Eth-Trunk interfaces.\nThe number of network-side EAP access users and that of BAS access users are independent of each other.\nIf a sub-interface of a main interface is configured as a BAS interface, the dot1x enable command cannot be run on the main interface.\nThe dot1x enable command does not support virtual cluster and multi-VS modes (excluding Admin VS).\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
