    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n802.1X authentication supports two modes: EAP relay mode and EAP termination mode.\nIn EAP relay mode, the device relays EAP packets between the client and the RADIUS server. The device encapsulates EAPoR packets into EAPoL packets before relaying them to the client or encapsulates EAPoL packets into EAPoR packets before relaying them to the RADIUS server.In EAP termination mode, the device terminates EAP packets between the client and the RADIUS server. The device maps EAPoL packets to PAP/CHAP packets before sending them to the RADIUS server or maps PAP/CHAP packets to EAPoL packets before sending them to the client. To enable an authentication method for users using the dot1x template for EAP termination, run the eap-end command.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nPAP is not a secure protocol, and CHAP is recommended."
