    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFor scattered users, MAC-based access control for 802.1X authentication is recommended: Every user accessing an interface must be authenticated. If a user goes offline, other 802.1X authenticated users can still access the network.For group users, interface-based access control for 802.1X authentication is recommended: After a user is authenticated, subsequent users can pass the authentication or access the network without being authenticated. If all users who pass the authentication go offline, the other users who are not authenticated are denied access to the network. To configure an access control type for an 802.1X authentication-enabled interface, run the dot1x port-method command.\n\nPrerequisites\n802.1X authentication has been enabled on the interface using the dot1x enable command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
