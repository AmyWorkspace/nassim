    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, each packet head getting instance on the main control board uses 2 MB. The instance is cleared automatically after having been saved for 10 minutes on the main control board. If the main control board saves information about multiple packet head getting instances within 10 minutes, the memory usage of the main control board may become very high. This will affect main control board performance. If all instances saved to the main control board's memory are all unwanted, run the capture-packet free all command to delete these instances. If one instance is unwanted, run the capture-packet free instance-id instance-id command to delete the instance.\nPrecautions\nThe information cleared by using the preceding commands cannot be restored. Therefore, exercise caution when running any command."
