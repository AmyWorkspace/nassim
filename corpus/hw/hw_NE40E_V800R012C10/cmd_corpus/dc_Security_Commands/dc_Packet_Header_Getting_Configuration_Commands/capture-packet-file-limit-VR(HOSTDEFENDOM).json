    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can set the maximum number of packet header obtaining files (with a suffix name .cap) in the packet header obtaining directory to save system storage space and ensure that new packet header obtaining files can be properly stored.\nPrecautions\nAfter the capture-packet file limit command is run, if the number of packet header obtaining files in the directory exceeds the upper limit, the system does not delete the files immediately. Instead, the system deletes the earliest one or more files when an additional packet header obtaining file is created.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
