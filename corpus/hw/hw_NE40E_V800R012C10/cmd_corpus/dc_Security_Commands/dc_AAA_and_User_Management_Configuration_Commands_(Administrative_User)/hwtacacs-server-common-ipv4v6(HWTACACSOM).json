Even if the AAA servers share the same IP address and VPN instance, the configurations have to be repeated for three times. To simplify operations, configure a common server.\nPrecautions\nThe priority of the common server is higher than that of the AAA servers. When the common server is configured as the primary server, the configurations on the AAA servers do not take effect.\nThe IP addresses of the primary and the secondary servers must be different; otherwise, the server configuration fails."
