    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAll the authorization of access users is implemented through authorization schemes in the domain view. You need to configure authorization schemes in the AAA view. The default authorization scheme of AAA adopts local authorization. The authorization-scheme command creates an authorization scheme.\nIf the authorization scheme to be created by the authorization-scheme command has the same name with an existing authorization scheme, the authorization scheme view is displayed directly.\nThe undo authorization-scheme command can delete only the existing authorization schemes that are not bound to any domains.\nAfter entering a new authorization scheme view, you can modify the authorization scheme, for example, change the authorization mode or enable command-line-based authorization. When the new authorization scheme is completed, you can associate a domain with this authorization scheme."
