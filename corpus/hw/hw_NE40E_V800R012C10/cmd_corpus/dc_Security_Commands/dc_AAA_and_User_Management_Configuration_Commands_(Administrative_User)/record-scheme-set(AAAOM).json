    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo simplify security management for users, use HWTACACS to record the commands that are executed by users to a HWTACACS server. When the HWTACACS recording function is enabled, and a recording scheme is configured on the current server, you can run the recording-mode command to configure an HWTACACS template associated with the recording scheme.\nPrerequisites\nBefore the recording-mode command is run, the HWTACACS server template to be associated with the recording scheme must have been created."
