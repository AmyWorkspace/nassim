To configure another delimiter, run the domain-name-delimiter command.\nIf the user name of a local user contains delimiters, the user name changes synchronously after the delimiter is changed. For example, if a local user named Huawei123@123 exists, after the delimiter is changed from @ to |, the user name synchronously changes to Huawei123|123."
