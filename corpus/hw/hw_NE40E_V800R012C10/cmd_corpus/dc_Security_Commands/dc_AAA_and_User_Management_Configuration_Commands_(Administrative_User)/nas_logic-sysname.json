    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe nas logic-port and nas logic-sysname commands are applied to the remote backup of user information. Through these commands, the NAS-Port, NAS-Port-ID, and Option82 information in the packets that the primary and secondary devices send to the RADIUS and DHCP servers are identical.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe NAS-Port and NAS-Port-ID attributes for the users' RADIUS authentication contain the logical host name and logical port number. If the logical host name cannot be obtained, these attributes contain only the logical port number.\nPrecautions\nThis command is used only to check packet validity when the device sends the NAS-Identifier attribute of the RADIUS server or when the RADIUS server delivers COA or DM packets. This command canot be used to generate the user Accounting-session-ID, Accounting-Multi-session-ID, local Option 82 information, default PPP and DHCP user names, and NAS-Port-ID and Calling-Station-ID attributes sent to the RADIUS server."
