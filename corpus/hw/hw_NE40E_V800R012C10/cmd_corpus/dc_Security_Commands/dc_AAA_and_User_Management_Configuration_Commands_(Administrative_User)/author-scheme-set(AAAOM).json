    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAAA supports four authorization modes: local authorization, non-authorization, if-authenticated authorization, and HWTACACS authorization. In addition, AAA allows combination of these modes. When a combination of authorization modes is adopted, the authorization modes included in the combination are used in sequence.\nWhen a combination of authorization modes includes the non-authorization mode, the non-authorization mode must be used last.\nAn authorization mode needs to be set in the authorization scheme view. When an authorization scheme is created, by default, the local authorization mode is used.\nPrerequisites\nBefore using this command, you must create an authorization scheme and enter the authorization scheme view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf several authorization modes are set for an authorization scheme, they take effect in the sequence of configuration. The next authorization mode is attempted only when the current authorization mode does not respond. If the user fails the authorization in a certain mode, the authorization of the next mode is not performed.If the current authorization mode does not respond, the system goes to the next authorization mode. If the current authorization fails or succeeds, the system does not go to next authorization mode.\nPrecautions\nIf you need to use the HWTACACS authorization mode, you must configure the HWTACACS server template and apply the server template in the view of the domain to which the user belongs.\nIf the if-authenticated mode is used and the authentication scheme is not none, a user is authorized the VTY user permission after being authenticated. Therefore, the if-authenticated mode is not recommended."
