    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe radius-server packet command can be used to increase the DSCP value for RADIUS packets sent by the device to a RADIUS server, preventing RADIUS packet loss during network congestion.\nSetting a DSCP value for the RADIUS packets sent by the device to a RADIUS server does not affect the DSCP value in RADIUS packets sent by the device to an AP/AC.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the radius-server packet command is run in both the system view and RADIUS server group view, the setting in the RADIUS server group view takes precedence over that in the system view."
