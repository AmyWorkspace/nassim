    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prompt a local administrator to change the initial password that is configured by the highest-level administrator, run the user-password change command. The method of configuring an initial password varies in different views.\nA highest-level administrator can run the user  password [ cipher  | irreversible-cipher  ] command in the local AAA server view to set an initial password.\nPrerequisites\nA local user has logged in to the device as an administrator.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe user-password change command applies only to administrators. If an administrator does not change the initial password, the system prompts the administrator to change it upon each login. A local administrator can run the local-user change-password command to change the password.\nPrecautions\nThe user-password change command that is configured in the AAA view or local AAA server view takes effect only for users in the specific view and does not affect another in the other view."
