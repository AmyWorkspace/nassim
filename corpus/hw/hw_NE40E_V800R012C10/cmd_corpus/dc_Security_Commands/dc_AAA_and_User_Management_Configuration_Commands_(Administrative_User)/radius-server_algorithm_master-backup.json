    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe radius-server algorithm command takes effect only for all authentication servers and accounting serves in a specified RADIUS server.\nWhen the active/standby algorithm is used, the second configured RADIUS server becomes the master server if the master RADIUS server is deleted.\nA RADIUS server group supports a maximum of sixteen authentication servers and sixteen accounting servers."
