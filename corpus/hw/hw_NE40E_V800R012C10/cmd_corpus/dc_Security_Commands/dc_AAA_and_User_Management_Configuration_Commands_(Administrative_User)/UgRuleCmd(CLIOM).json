    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo provide granular management and flexible configuration and allow a command or a batch of commands with the same prefix to be executed in a view or prohibit them from being executed in a view, run the rule command command.The priorities of rules are displayed in descending order of rules configured in the user group view (including the rules inherited from other user groups using the include user-group command), rules configured in the task group view (rule command), and tasks configured in the task group (task).\nPrecautions\nIn the same user group, two rules with the same view and keyword cannot be configured. For example, if the sysname command is allowed to be executed in the system view in rule 1, the sysname command cannot be configured in a second rule.\nIf the rules configured in a user group conflict with the rules inherited from other user groups using the include user-group command, the rules configured in the user group take effect preferentially.\nIf the rule command command is run several times, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
