    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRun the realtime-accounting backup enable command if the RADIUS server requires that the interval at which real-time accounting packets are sent be strictly followed.\nConfiguration Impact\n?By default, the real-time accounting interval is reset after a master/slave main control board switchover. If a master/slave main control board switchover occurs during the real-time accounting interval, the real-time accounting interval is reset, and the device will send real-time accounting packets after this interval elapses, which is longer than the configured interval.\nAfter the realtime-accounting backup enable command is run, the master and slave main control boards start real-time accounting at the same time. Even if a master/slave main control board switchover occurs during the real-time accounting interval, the device still sends real-time accounting packets at the configured interval.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
