    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen users logging in through the console interface and users logging in using other login methods must be distinguished, run the service-type terminal force-domain command to specify a forced domain for the console interface. After the configuration becomes effective, users logging in through the console interface automatically enter the forced domain and are not allocated any other domain based on the user names. In this manner, users logging in through the console interface and users logging using other methods are distinguished and allocated different rights.\nPrecautions\nYou can specify only one forced domain for the console interface on a device."
