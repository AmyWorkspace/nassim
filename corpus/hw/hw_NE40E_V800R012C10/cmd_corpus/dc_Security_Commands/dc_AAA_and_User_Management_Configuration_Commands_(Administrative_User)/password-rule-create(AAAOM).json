After the forbidden word command is executed, a newly configured or modified password cannot contain any forbidden password string. Otherwise, the configuration fails. If an existing password contains a forbidden password string, the system will prompt the user to change the password. The user, however, can continue to use the password.\nPrecautions\nA device supports a maximum of 32 password configuration rules. Each rule can specify only one forbidden password string."
