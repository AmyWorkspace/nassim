    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the aaa abnormal-offline-record command is run, the system records unexpected logout events in the memory for administrators to manage the device and locate faults. If only the unexpected logout events during a specific period are required, run the undo aaa abnormal-offline-record command to disable the system from recording unexpected logout events. After the undo aaa abnormal-offline-record command is run, the system does not record unexpected logout events in the memory, which increases the memory space but brings risks that administrators cannot view unexpected logout information.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the system is configured to record unexpected logout events, you can run the display aaa abnormal-offline-record command to view the unexpected logout information."
