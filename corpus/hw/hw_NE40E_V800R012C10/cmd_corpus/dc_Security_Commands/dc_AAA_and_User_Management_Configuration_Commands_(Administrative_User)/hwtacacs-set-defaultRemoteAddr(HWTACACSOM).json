    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, no default remote address is available for an HWTACACS client to communicate with an HWTACACS server. That is, if an HWTACACS client accesses an HWTACACS server in a mode that does not require any IP address, the rem_addr field in the packet sent from the client to the server is empty. To configure a default remote address for a device functioning as an HWTACACS client to communicate with an HWTACACS server, run the hwtacacs-server default remote-address command. If the rem_addr field in the authentication, authorization, or accounting request packet to be sent from the client to the server is empty, the remote address configured using this command is displayed for the rem_addr field in the packet received by the server."
