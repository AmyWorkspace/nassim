    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prevent security risks such as account stealing, run the user-password min-len command to raise password strength requirements.\nPrerequisites\nA local user has logged in to the device as an administrator.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the user-password min-len command is configured, the length of the passwords configured for the subsequent users must exceed the minimum value; otherwise, the users cannot be created or the passwords cannot be modified.\nPrecautions\nThis command applies to the passwords in simple text mode only.\nThe user-password min-len command that is configured in the AAA view or local AAA server view takes effect only for users in the specific view and does not affect another in the other view.\nIf the login password does not satisfy the minimum password length requirements, the system prompts you to change your password. Change your password based on the prompted message."
