    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSession CAR for the RADIUS whitelist is enabled by default to isolate the whitelist packet channel. This allows session-specific rate limiting and avoids packets from different RADIUS sessions from preempting bandwidth resources. If session CAR for the RADIUS whitelist makes the system prone to attacks, run the whitelist session-car radius disable command to disable session CAR for the RADIUS whitelist and ensure normal sending of RADIUS packets.\nPrecautions\nSession CAR for the RADIUS whitelist can be disabled only when this function does not work properly. In normal cases, you are advised to enable session CAR for the RADIUS whitelist."
