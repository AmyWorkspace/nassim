    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can configure all HWTACACS packets sent by the device to use the same source IP address. In this way, the HWTACACS server uses only one IP address to communicate with the Router.\nIn this command, the source IP address for HWTACACS packets must be the same as the destination IP address for response packets from the HWTACACS server, and the source IP address must exist on the HWTACACS server.Changing of source IP address is allowed, though requests are pending and the new source IP address is used for new requests."
