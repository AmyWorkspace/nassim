    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the user offline speed is too high, the CPU is overloaded. To dynamically control the user offline speed, run the offline-speed command to configure the offline speed. By doing so, you can limit CPU usage.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe configured offline speed takes effect for all users, regardless of their types, including PPP and IPoE, their address types, including IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack, or their offline reasons.\nIf the offline-speed command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
