    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn whitelist-based IPsec certificate authentication scenarios, to configure an alarm threshold for the number of configured whitelists, run the pki whitelist capacity warning-threshold command. When the percentage of the number of configured whitelists in the whitelist specification (20000) is greater than or equal to the alarm threshold, an alarm is generated. When the percentage of the number of configured whitelists in the whitelist specification (20000) falls below the alarm threshold, the alarm is cleared."
