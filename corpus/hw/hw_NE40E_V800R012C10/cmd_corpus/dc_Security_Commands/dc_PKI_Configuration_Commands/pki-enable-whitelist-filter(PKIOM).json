    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn whitelist-based IPsec certificate authentication scenarios, when the names of whitelists imported into a device or common names of the certificates received from the peer end are redundant, run the pki whitelist filter enable command to simplify the imported whitelists. For example, after the common name of a base station certificate on the live network is imported into a whitelist, a record carrying different suffixes may be generated, causing one base station in the whitelist to consume multiple whitelist resources. To resolve this problem, run the pki whitelist filter enable command."
