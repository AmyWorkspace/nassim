    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA certificate authority (CA) specifies the validity period of a certificate before issuing the certificate. If a certificate has expired, the certificate cannot be used. You can run the certificate update expire-time command to set the time for updating certificates.\nPrerequisites\nBefore you run the certificate update expire-time command, run the certificate auto-update enable command to enable the automatic certificate update function.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you run the certificate update expire-time command on a device, the device automatically initiates a certificate update request to the connected CMPv2 server when the percentage of the duration of a certificate in the validity period of the certificate reaches a specified value."
