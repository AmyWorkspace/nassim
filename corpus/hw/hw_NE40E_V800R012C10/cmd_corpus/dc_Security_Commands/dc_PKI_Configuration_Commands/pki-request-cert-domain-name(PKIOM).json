    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCurrently, the device only supports the offline application of the certificate. The user needs to generate a certificate request file on the device, and sends the file to the CA through the methods such as disks, and emails to apply for the local certificate.\nTo generate the certificate request file, run the pki request-certificate domain command. The file name is domain-name.req, and SHA2-256 is used as the signature algorithm by default. MD5 uses a 128-bit key, SHA1 uses a 160-bit key, SHA2-256 uses a 256-bit key, SHA2-384 uses a 384-bit key, and SHA2-512 uses a 512-bit key. A longer key has a higher security but a lower calculating rate. Configuring MD5 or SHA1 is not recommended for the sake of security."
