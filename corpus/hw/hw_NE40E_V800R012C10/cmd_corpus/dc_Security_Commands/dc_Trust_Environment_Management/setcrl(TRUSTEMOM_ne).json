    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe lifetime of a digital certificate is limited, and a CA can revoke the digital certificate to shorten the certificate lifetime. A CRL specifies a list of invalid certificates issued by CAs. If a CA revokes a certificate, the declaration about authorized key pairs is revoked before the certificate expires. Once the CRL expires, data listed in the CRL is deleted to shorten the CRL.\nA certificate needs to be revoked due to various reasons, for example, key disclosure. In this case, a third-party tool can be used to mark the issued certificate invalid. Such certificates are listed in a CRL. To load an SSL CRL onto a device, run the remote-attestation ssl crl load command."
