    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe PKI is a framework that consists of a collection of protocols and cryptographic algorithm suites. It offers a variety of services, such as authentication, integrity protection, confidentiality, and access control.\nThe remote attestation function uses the PKI authentication mechanism and attestation identity key (AIK) certificates to check the reliability of devices. To bind remote attestation to a PKI domain, run the remote-attestation pki bind domain command.\nPrerequisites\nA PKI domain has been configured using the pki domain domain-name command"
