    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAttackers may use specific tools to scan hosts on one network segment or hosts on different network segments. Before routers respond with reply packets, the routers search for ARP entries. If the MAC addresses of the destination IP addresses do not exist, the ARP module of the routers will send ARP Miss messages to the upper-layer software, requiring the upper-layer software to send ARP Request messages to obtain the corresponding MAC addresses. A great number of scanning packets generate abundant ARP Miss messages. The router then wastes resources in processing the ARP Miss messages, which affects the processing of other services.\nThe output of the display arp-miss speed-limit source-ip command includes:\nSlot number of the specified interface boardMessage type of timestamp suppressionTimestamp suppression rate\nThis command is supported only by physical systems (PSs).\n\nPrerequisites\nTo ensure the effectiveness when running the command, the timestamp suppression rate should have been set for ARP Miss messages by using the arp-miss speed-limit command."
