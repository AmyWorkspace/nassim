    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIf an unauthorized user sends a large number of ARP messages to a device, the device learns a large number of ARP entries in a short period of time, causing the ARP buffer to overflow. As a result, normal operation of the network is affected. To address such a problem, you can set the maximum number of ARP entries that each interface can learn.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nIf the number of ARP entries that an interface can learn changes, and the number of the learned ARP entries exceeds the changed value, the interface cannot learn additional ARP entries. You can delete the excess ARP entries based on the system prompt.\nIf this command is run more than once, all configurations take effect.\n\nPrecautions\n\nThe Ethernet interface, GE interface, VE interface, or Eth-trunk interface can be used as a Layer 3 interface or a Layer 2 interface. vlan-id cannot be configured for the Layer 3 interface. vlan-id is required for the Layer 2 interface.\nEthernet sub-interface, GE sub-interface, or Eth-Trunk sub-interface can be a common sub-interface or a QinQ sub-interface. For a common QinQ sub-interface, vlan-id is unavailable. For a QinQ sub-interface, vlan-id is required as the outer VLAN ID of the QinQ sub-interface.\nIf a common sub-interface is limited in ARP entry learning and configured as a QinQ sub-interface, the ARP learning limit is deleted.\nIf a QinQ sub-interface is limited in ARP entry learning and the QinQ configuration is deleted from the sub-interface, the ARP learning limit is unavailable."
