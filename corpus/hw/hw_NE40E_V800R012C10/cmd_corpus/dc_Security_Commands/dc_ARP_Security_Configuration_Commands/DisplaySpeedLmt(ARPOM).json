    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo identify whether the processing failure of normal ARP packets is because the rate of timestamp suppression for ARP packets is too small, causing the system unable to refresh ARP entries in time, you can run the display arp speed-limit command to view the set timestamp suppression rate for the ARP packets.\nImplementation Procedure\nIf no slot ID is specified, the rate of timestamp suppression for ARP packets on all interface boards is displayed. If a slot number is specified, the rate of timestamp suppression for ARP packets on a specified interface board is displayed."
