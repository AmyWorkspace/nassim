    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command displays the statistics on the ARP request packets, response packets, packets sent to the CPU, and discarded packets, helping users to know the traffic status on an interface board.\nPrerequisites\nRun the arp-safeguard enable command to enable ARP bidirectional isolation. If ARP bidirectional isolation or arp fast reply is not enabled on the interface, the displayed statistics will be 0. By default, the ARP bidirectional isolation function is disabled and the ARP fast reply function is enabled.\nFollow-up Procedure\nYou can run the reset arp-safeguard statistics command to reset the statistics on ARP request packets, response packets, packets sent to the CPU, and discarded packets on a specified interface."
