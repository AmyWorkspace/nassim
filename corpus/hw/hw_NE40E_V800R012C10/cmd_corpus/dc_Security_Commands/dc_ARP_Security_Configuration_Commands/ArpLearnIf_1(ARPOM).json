    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nTo ensure network security or facilitate network management, you can enable or disable dynamic ARP entry learning on an interface. You can run the arp learning disable command together with the arp-limit or arp learning strict command to better control dynamic ARP entry learning on an interface.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nIf dynamic ARP entry learning is disabled on an interface, traffic forwarding may fail on this interface.\n\nPrecautions\n\nAfter dynamic ARP entry learning is disabled on an interface, the system will not automatically delete the ARP entries that were learnt previously on this interface. You can choose to delete or retain these dynamic ARP entries as required."
