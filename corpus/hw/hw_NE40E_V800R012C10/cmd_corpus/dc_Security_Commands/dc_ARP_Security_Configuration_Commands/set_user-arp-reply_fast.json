    "ExtraInfo": "If a large number of IPoEv4 users whose IP addresses are dynamically assigned go online and send a large number of ARP request packets in a short period, the CPU will be busy processing ARP request packets, causing high CPU usage. To resolve this problem, run the set user-arp-reply fast command to enable the rapid ARP reply function. After the rapid ARP reply function is enabled, the device sends the received ARP packets to hosts without sending to the CPU."
