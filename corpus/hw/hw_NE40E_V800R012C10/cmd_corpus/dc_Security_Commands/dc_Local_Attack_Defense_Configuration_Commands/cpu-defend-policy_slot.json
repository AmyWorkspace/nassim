    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo apply an attack defense policy to an AP's board, you can run the cpu-defend-policy command in the virtual access AP view on the master device. Alternatively, you can run the cpu-defend-policy command in the slot view on the AP.\nTo apply an attack defense policy to an AP in a non-1:1-backup scenario, run the cpu-defend-policy slot command.\nTo apply an attack defense policy to an AP in a 1:1 backup scenario, run the cpu-defend-policy redundant command.\nPrerequisites\nThe attack defense policy specified by policy-number has been configured.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe slot ID specified in the cpu-defend-policy command can be that of a board that has not been properly installed or registered."
