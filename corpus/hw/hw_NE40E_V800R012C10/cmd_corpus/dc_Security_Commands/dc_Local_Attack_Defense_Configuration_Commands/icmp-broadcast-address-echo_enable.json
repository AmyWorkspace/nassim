    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA device drops ICMP echo request packets that carry broadcast addresses (including subnet broadcast and network broadcast addresses) as destination IP addresses by default. When the device is required to normally process broadcast ICMP echo request packets, run the icmp-broadcast-address-echo enable command to enable the device to receive broadcast ICMP echo request packets.\nWhen the device receives a large number of broadcast ICMP echo request packets, you can disable the device from receiving broadcast ICMP echo request packets to reduce the load of the device and prevent Smurf attacks.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
