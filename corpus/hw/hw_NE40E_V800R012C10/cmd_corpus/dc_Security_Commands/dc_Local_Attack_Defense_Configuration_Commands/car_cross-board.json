    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nExcessive inter-board trunk packets and inter-board packets on a dumb terminal can cause downstream traffic congestion and reduce CPU efficiency. To implement rate limiting for inter-board trunk packets and inter-board packets on a dumb terminal, run the car cross-board command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
