    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a device to collect statistics about different protocol packets received on an interface, run the ip host packet statistics protocol enable command.\nTo view statistics about different protocol packets received on an interface, run the display ip host packet statistics receive protocol interface command. To clear statistics about different protocol packets received on an interface, run the reset ip host packet statistics receive protocol interface command. The display ip host packet statistics receive protocol interface and reset ip host packet statistics receive protocol interface commands can be used together to help identify whether an interface correctly receives various protocol packets.\nPrecautions\nWhen a sub-interface is deleted, packet statistics on the corresponding physical interface remain unchanged.\nWhen the board is restarted, packet statistics on the board's interfaces are cleared. If any interface on the board has been added to an Eth-Trunk interface, packet statistics on the Eth-Trunk interface no longer include those on the member interface after the board is restarted."
