    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo help the Router defend against attacks or unauthorized logins initiated by sending protocol packets, management and service plane protection is used to prevent packets of a specified protocol or all protocols from being sent to the CPU. Using management and service plane protection improves device security and reliability and ensures normal network operation.\nTo verify management and service plane protection or troubleshoot faults, run the display cpu-defend ma-defend statistics command to view statistics about packets processed using management and service plane protection.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
