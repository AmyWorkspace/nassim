    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf Layer 2 loop detection is disabled, you can run the undo l2-loop-detect disable command to enable the Layer 2 loop detection. If you want to disable Layer 2 loop detection, run the l2-loop-detect disable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter Layer 2 loop detection is disabled by running the l2-loop-detect disable command, the board's CPU usage may increase when Layer 2 loops occur on interfaces, which may result in service interruptions.\nTo re-enable Layer 2 loop detection, run the undo l2-loop-detect disable command. After Layer 2 loop detection is enabled, the board checks the received packets, consuming the board's CPU resources.\nFollow-up Procedure\nIf you disable Layer 2 loop detection during the board fault locating, enable Layer 2 loop detection after the fault is cleared.\nPrecautions\nIf you need to disable Layer 2 loop detection, contact Huawei technical support engineers.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
