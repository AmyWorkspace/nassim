If the cpu-defend-policy command is not run, the default attack defense policy is applied to the interface board.\nPrerequisites\nThe attack defense policy specified by policy-number must be an existing one; otherwise, it cannot be applied to an interface board.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
