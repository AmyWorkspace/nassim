    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can configure a blacklist to filter out packets that do not need to be sent to the CPU. By default, no blacklist is configured. The blacklist function takes effect only after packets matching specific ACL rules are added to the blacklist through the blacklist acl command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nAfter the blacklist function is disabled, you can still configure a user-defined blacklist, but the configured blacklist does not take effect."
