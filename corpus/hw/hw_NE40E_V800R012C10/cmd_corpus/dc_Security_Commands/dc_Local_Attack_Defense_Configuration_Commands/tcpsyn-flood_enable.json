    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA TCP SYN flooding attack is a form of Denial of Service (DOS) attack. It sends a large quantity of illegal TCP SYN packets to the server. These packets keep the server so busy that it is unable to answer other clients' requests and finally crashes because of being overburdened.\nThe Device performs the CAR on TCP SYN packets that match the set ACLs. This effectively suppresses malicious TCP connection requests. In addition, the aging time for TCP SYN packets is set. Currently, the default aging time of TCY SYN packets is 75 seconds. In fact, the time can be set from 2 to 600 seconds. You are advised to set the aging time to 2 to 5 seconds when the device is under attacks.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
