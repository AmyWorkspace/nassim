    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo view statistics about packets received on interfaces that rank top 10 in the number of received packets, run the display ip host packet statistics receive command. The system collects statistics about packets received on physical interfaces and sub-interfaces of each board and ranks these interfaces based on the number of packets received by them. After the display ip host packet statistics receive command is run, the system ranks the interfaces of all boards (top 10 interfaces out of one board) and displays statistics about the top 10. If less than ten interfaces are involved, all of them are displayed in the command output.\nTo clear statistics about packets received on an interface, run the reset ip host packet statistics receive. The display ip host packet statistics receive and reset ip host packet statistics receive commands can be used together to help identify whether the interface correctly receives various protocol packets."
