    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a device to collect statistics about protocol-specific received packets, run the ip host packet statistics protocol enable command.\nTo clear statistics about different protocol packets received on an interface, run the reset ip host packet statistics receive protocol interface command.\nTo view statistics about different protocol packets received on an interface, run the display ip host packet statistics receive protocol interface command.\nThe reset ip host packet statistics receive protocol interface and display ip host packet statistics receive protocol interface commands can be used together to help identify whether the interface correctly receives various protocol packets."
