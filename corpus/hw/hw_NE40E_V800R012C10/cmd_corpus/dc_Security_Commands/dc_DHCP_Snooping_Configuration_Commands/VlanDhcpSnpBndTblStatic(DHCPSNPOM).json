    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run the dhcp snooping bind-table static command to configure static DHCP snooping binding entries. Dynamic DHCP snooping binding entries do not need to be configured but are automatically generated when DHCP snooping is enabled.\nThe static entry to be deleted must exist in the DHCP snooping binding table.\nPrecautions\nLayer 3 interfaces have to be switched to Layer 2 interfaces before being added to a VLAN. Otherwise, Layer 3 interfaces cannot be added to a VLAN."
