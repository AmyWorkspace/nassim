    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAttackers may apply to a DHCP server for IP addresses by sending a large number of DHCP packets with varied MAC addresses in frame headers. As a result, IP addresses in the address pool are exhausted. To protect devices against such attacks, run the dhcp snooping user-bind max-number command.\nPrerequisites\nDHCP snooping has been enabled globally by running the dhcp snooping enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the number of binding entries reaches the maximum number, no users can obtain IP addresses."
