    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDHCP snooping whitelist is used on the AC and network sides of the UPE to filter DHCP packets to be sent to the CPU. After DHCP snooping is enabled, run the dhcp snooping packet whitelist command to create a whitelist. Only DHCP packets listed in the whitelist are sent to the CPU, and the DHCP packets not listed in the whitelist are simply forwarded. This protects the device against attacks.\nPrecautions\nNote the following:\nA maximum of eight whitelists can be configured for each VS.If a whitelist has been applied, you must run the undo dhcp snooping apply packet whitelist command to cancel the application of the whitelist before deleting it.To make a whitelist take effect, you must run the dhcp snooping enable command to enable DHCP snooping globally after the whitelist is applied.In VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
