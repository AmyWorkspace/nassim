    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, DHCP snooping unicast packets in VPLS scenarios are forwarded using CPU, and the EXP values of MPLS packets sent to the tunnel side are mapped to DSCP values (equal to the EXP values) of IP packets. After the dhcp snooping unicast cpu-forward disable command is used to disable CPU forwarding for DHCP snooping unicast packets, DHCP snooping unicast packets in VPLS scenarios are forwarded using hardware. The EXP values of MPLS packets sent to the tunnel side are mapped to the DSCP values (6 by default) of IP packets based on the DSCP-EXP mappings specified using the host-packet dscp map command.\nPrerequisites\nDHCP snooping has been enabled using the dhcp snooping enable command."
