    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBogus DHCP servers may send incorrect IP addresses to DHCP clients. As a result, DHCP clients cannot obtain services. To resolve this problem, you can enable DHCP snooping and configure interfaces connected with legitimate DHCP servers trusted. The other interfaces are untrusted by default. The device discards the DHCP reply packets received from untrusted interfaces to prevent bogus DHCP server attacks.\nPrerequisites\nDHCP snooping has been enabled globally by running the dhcp snooping enable command.\nPrecautions\nAfter DHCP snooping is enabled, all interfaces are untrusted by default.\nWhen DHCP snooping is disabled, all interfaces are trusted by default.\nIf an interface is changed from untrusted to trusted, the dynamic DHCP snooping binding table is deleted from the interface."
