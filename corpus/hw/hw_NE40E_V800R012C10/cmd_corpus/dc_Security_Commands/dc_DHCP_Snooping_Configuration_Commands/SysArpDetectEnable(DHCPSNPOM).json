    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a client obtains an IP address and gets offline abnormally, the client cannot release its IP address by sending a DHCP release packet. As a result, the IP address cannot be reassigned to other clients. To resolve this problem, you can run the dhcp snooping user-bind arp-detect enable command to enable the association between ARP and DHCP snooping.\nPrerequisites\nDHCP snooping has been enabled globally by running the dhcp snooping enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the association between ARP and DHCP snooping is configured:\nThe system uses ARP to detect a client periodically. If the system cannot detect the client for specified times (using arp detect-times command to set the aging detection times), the system will delete the DHCP snooping binding entry for the client. The system also sends a release packet to the DHCP server to release the client's IP address.If no ARP entry is matched, the system sends ARP probe packets to the user with the IP address corresponding to the ARP entry, causing ARP packets on the network to accumulate."
