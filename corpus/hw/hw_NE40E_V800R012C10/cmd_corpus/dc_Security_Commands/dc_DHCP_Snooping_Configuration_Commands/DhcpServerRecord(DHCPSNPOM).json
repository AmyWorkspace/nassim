    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBogus DHCP servers send invalid DHCP reply packets to clients. As a result, clients receive incorrect information. After the detection of bogus DHCP server is enabled, the device detects the DHCP server address and interface number carried in a received DHCP packet and logs the information so that the network administrator can maintain the network.\nPrerequisites\nDHCP snooping has been enabled globally and for an interface by running the dhcp snooping enable command.\nIf DHCP snooping is enabled globally but not for an interface and trusted interfaces are configured by running the dhcp snooping trusted command, the device can also generate logs."
