Dynamic binding entries can be generated after DHCP snooping is configured.\nThe static entry to be deleted must exist in the DHCP snooping binding table.\nThe DHCP snooping binding table on each interface can be configured with a maximum of 4096 static entries. During the configuration of a static entry, if the number of static entries on an interface reaches 4096, the configuration failure."
