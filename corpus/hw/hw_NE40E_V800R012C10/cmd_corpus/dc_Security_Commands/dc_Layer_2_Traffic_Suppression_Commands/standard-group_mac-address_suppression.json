You can run the standard-group mac-address suppression enable command to enable traffic suppression for special reserved multicast groups to control the multicast traffic.\nThe standard-group mac-address suppression enable command takes effect only after the multicast-suppression command is configured.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
