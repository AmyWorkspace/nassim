    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nWhen interfaces receive broadcast packets, unknown multicast packets, or unknown unicast packets, the interfaces broadcast these packets. However, if these packets are from attackers, they will consume a lot of device resources, causing device performance deterioration and even device breakdown. To resolve this problem, run this command to disable an interface from forwarding broadcast packets, unknown multicast packets, or unknown unicast packets."
