This command applies to GE sub-interfaces and Eth-Trunk sub-interfaces in VPLS scenarios.In VLAN scenarios, this command applies to GE main interfaces and Eth-Trunk main interfaces.In BD scenarios, only traffic suppression statistics on BD member interfaces can be queried. This command applies to GE sub-interfaces and Eth-Trunk sub-interfaces in BD scenarios.\nLayer 2 traffic suppression statistics are reported in real time and are not affected when the interval at which interface-based statistics are collected is changed."
