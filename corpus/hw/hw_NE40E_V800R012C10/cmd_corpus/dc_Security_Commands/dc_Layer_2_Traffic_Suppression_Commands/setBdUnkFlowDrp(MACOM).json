    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen interfaces in a BD receive unknown unicast packets, or unknown unicast packets, the interfaces broadcast these packets in the BD. If the interfaces broadcast a large number of attack packets, the forwarding and security of other packets are threatened.\nTo disable interfaces in a BD from forwarding unknown unicast packets, or unknown unicast packets, run this command."
