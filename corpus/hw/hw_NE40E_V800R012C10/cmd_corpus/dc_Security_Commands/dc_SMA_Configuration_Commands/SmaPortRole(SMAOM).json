    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nTo set an interface type on an AER, run the sma role command in the interface view.\nAER interfaces can be classified so that packets can be sorted and tags can be added to a specific type of packets. A receive end can verify the tags in the packets it receives before forwarding the packets. A connected interface on an AER must be of one of the following types:\n\nIngress interface: connected to an interface of a non-SMA router (usually an intra-IGP area router) in a local AS. Packets that arrive at the ingress interface of an AER can carry the source IPv6 address prefix of the local AS only. The AER must add a tag to each packet that carries the local AS's source IPv6 address prefix and a destination IPv6 address prefix of another member AS. Other packets are directly forwarded by the AER without tag addition.\nEgress interface: connected to another AS. Packets that arrive at the egress interface of an AER must not carry the source IPv6 address prefix of the local AS. The AER must verify each packet that carries the source IPv6 address prefix of another member AS and a destination IPv6 address prefix of a local AS. Other packets are directly forwarded by the AER without tag verification.\nTrust interface: connected to an interface of an SMA router in a local AS. Packets that arrive at the trust interface of an AER are forwarded, without being checked.\n\n\nPrecautions\n\nAfter the undo sma command is run to delete the SMA view, the sma role command run in each interface view is also deleted.\n\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
