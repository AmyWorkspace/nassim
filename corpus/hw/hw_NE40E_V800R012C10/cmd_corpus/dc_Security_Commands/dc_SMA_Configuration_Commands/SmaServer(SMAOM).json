    "ExtraInfo": "An ACS, functioning as an agent of a local AS in a trust alliance, communicates with the registration center (REG) and other ASs in the trust alliance and sends configurations to AERs in the local AS. Each member in a trust alliance has only one ACS.\nAfter entering the SMA view using the sma command, run the server ipv6 address command to set an IPv6 address of an ACS. An ACS communicates with AERs in the same AS so that the ACS can send the trust alliance member list, IPv6 address prefixes, and tag information to the AERs. The ACS and AERs exchange SMA protocol packets to deploy functions, query information, and respond to requests."
