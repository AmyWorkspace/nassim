    "ExtraInfo": "To switch an AS edge router (AER) from the alarm mode to the filter mode, run the filter enable command. The green channel function is enabled by default on the AER and disabled when the AER is working in filter mode. Without the green channel, the AER working in filter mode both removes the SMA option from each packet and verifies tags in the packets. The AER sends only packets with valid tags to the AS control server (ACS) in the same AS and discards the packets with invalid tags.\nACSs communicate across ASs at the control plane. If an AER in a destination AS encounters an error, communication between the ACSs is interrupted, and the error cannot be rectified. To prevent these problems, the AER in the destination AS supports a green channel at the data plane. The AER removes the SMA option from each packet and forwards the packets directly to the ACS in the same AS along the green channel, without verifying tags in the packets."
