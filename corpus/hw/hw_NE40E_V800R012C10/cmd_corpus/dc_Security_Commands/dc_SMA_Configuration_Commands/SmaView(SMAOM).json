    "ExtraInfo": "The state machine-based anti-spoofing (SMA) source address verification solution, designed based on IPv6, is implemented by creating a trust alliance to associate ASs to verify source IPv6 addresses. In each member AS in the trust alliance, the SMA function must be deployed on each As edge router (AER). Before SMA is configured, run the sma command to display the SMA view.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
