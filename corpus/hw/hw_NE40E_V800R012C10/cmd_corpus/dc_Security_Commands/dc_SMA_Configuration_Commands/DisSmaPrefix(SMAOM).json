    "ExtraInfo": "An AER must be able to correctly sort IPv6 addresses so that it adds tags to the packets and checks tags. Therefore, an ACS must send IPv6 address prefixes of all trust alliance member ASs, including the local AS to the AER. To view information about IPv6 address prefixes of member ASs in a trust alliance, run the display sma prefix command on the AER. The command output contains information about the local AS, other member ASs, and IPv6 address prefixes of all ASs. You can also query information about active and inactive IPv6 address prefixes in a trust alliances. The inactive entries will take effect after a specified period of time elapses.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
