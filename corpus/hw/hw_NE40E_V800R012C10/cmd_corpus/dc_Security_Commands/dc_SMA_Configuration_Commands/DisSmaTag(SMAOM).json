    "ExtraInfo": "In a trust alliance, each ordered pair of member ASs is associated with a state machine that is used to generate and update tags. An AER in a source AS adds a tag to a packet sent to the other AER. Upon receipt of the packet, the other AER in the destination AS checks the tag to verify the source IPv6 address prefix carried in the packet.\nThe AERs themselves do not run a state transition algorithm and obtain new tags periodically from an AS control server (ACS). The ACS generates tags used by the ordered AS pair to send and receive packets and sends the tags to the AERs. In an ordered AS pair, a local AS is the source, and another trust alliance member AS is the destination.\nTo view tags used by all ordered AS pairs on an AER, run the display sma tag command.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
