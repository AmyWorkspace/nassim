    "ExtraInfo": "When an AS control server (ACS) receives information about AS changes or query requests sent by an AS edge router (AER), the ACS sends the latest trust alliance member list to the AER. To view the alliance member list information, run the display sma as command on the AER. The command output contains information about the local AS to which the AER belongs, information about other member AS in the trust alliance, and the ACS's IPv6 addresses in each AS. You can also query information about active and inactive trust alliances. The inactive entries will take effect after a specified period of time elapses.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
