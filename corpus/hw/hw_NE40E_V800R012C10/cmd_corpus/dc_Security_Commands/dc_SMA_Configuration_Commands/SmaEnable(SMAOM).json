    "ExtraInfo": "To enable SMA on an AER, run the sma enable command in the SMA view displayed using the sma command.\nAn AER is an edge router on an AS. It adds a tag to a packet that originates from a local AS and is destined for another member AS. The tag is a string that identifies a local AS. Upon receipt of the packet, a member AS verifies the tag information in the local AS's IPv6 address prefix. In addition, the AER verifies the source IPv6 address prefix carried in a packet that a device in a member AS sends to a local AS. The AER discards the packet without a tag or with an incorrect tag."
