    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRandom numbers are widely used in security scenarios. By default, the system uses the Dual_EC_DRBG function to generate random numbers. The random numbers comply with the NIST SP 800-90A standard and are of high security. However, in comparison with X9.31 standard-compliant random numbers, NIST SP 800-90A standard-compliant random numbers deteriorate device performance. To improve device performance, run the crypto drbg disable command to disable the Dual_EC_DRBG function and enable the system to generate random numbers in compliance with the X9.31 standard. Because X9.31 standard-compliant random numbers are not as secure as NIST SP 800-90A standard-compliant ones, exercise caution when running this command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
