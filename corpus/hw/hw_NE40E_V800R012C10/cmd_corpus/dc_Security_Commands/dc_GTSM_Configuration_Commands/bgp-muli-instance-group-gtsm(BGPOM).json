    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo protect a device against the attacks by the forged BGP packets, you can configure GTSM to check whether the TTL value in the IP packet header is within the valid range.\nPrerequisites\nBefore configuring GTSM for a peer group, you need to run the peer group command to add peers to the peer group.\nPrecautions\nWhen this command is used in the BGP view, it is also applicable to MP-BGP extensions because they use the same TCP connection.\nThe GTSM configurations are symmetrical, that is, GTSM must be enabled on both ends of the BGP connection at the same time.\nGSTM and EBGP-MAX-HOP are mutually exclusive because both of them affect the TTL of the sent BGP packet. Therefore, the two functions cannot be enabled on a peer or peer group simultaneously.\nIf GTSM is enabled on two directly connected EBGP peers, the fast sensing function on the interfaces directly connecting the EBGP peers is invalid. This is because BGP regards the EBGP peers as indirectly connected when GTSM is enabled on the EBGP peers."
