    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA keychain ensures a secure protocol packet transmission by changing the authentication algorithm and key dynamically. A keychain consists of multiple key IDs, each of which needs to be configured with an authentication algorithm. Different key IDs are valid within different time periods, ensuring dynamic change of keychain authentication algorithms.\nPackets are authenticated and encrypted based on the authentication algorithm associated with a specified key ID, improving the packet transmission security.\nThe characteristics of each authentication algorithm are as follows:\nMD5(Message Digest 5): The 128-bit MD5 message digest is calculated based on the entered message of any length.SHA-1(Secure Hash Algorithm): The 160-bit SHA-1 message digest is calculated based on the entered message with the length shorter than the 64th power of 2.HMAC-MD5(Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication-md5): The 128-bit HMAC-MD5 message digest is calculated based on the 512-bit message that is converted from the entered message of any length. If the length of an entered message is less than 512 bits, 0s are added to make up a 512-bit message. If the length of an entered message is greater than 512 bits, the message is converted into a 128-bit message based on the MD5 algorithm. After that, 0s are added to make up a 512-bit message.HMAC-SHA1-12: The 160-bit HMAC-SHA1-12 message digest is calculated based on the 512-bit message that is converted from the entered message of any length. The leftmost 96 bits (12 x 8) are used as the authentication code.HMAC-SHA1-20: The 160-bit HMAC-SHA1-20 message digest is calculated based on the 512-bit message that is converted from the entered message of any length. All the 160 bits are used as the authentication code.SHA-256: The 256-bit SHA-2 message digest is calculated based on the entered message with the length shorter than the 64th power of 2.HMAC-SHA-256: The 256-bit HMAC-SHA-256 message digest is calculated based on the 512-bit message that is converted from the entered message of any length. All the 256 bits are used as the authentication code.SM3: The 256-bit SM3 message digest is calculated based on the entered message with the length shorter than the 64th power of 2.\nThe calculation speed of the MD5 algorithm is faster than that of the SHA algorithm; the SHA algorithm is more secure than the MD5 algorithm. Compared with MD5 and SHA, HMAC is more secure, but slower in calculation speed. To ensure high security, do not use the MD5 or SHA-1 algorithm.\n\nPrerequisites\nKey IDs have been configured.\nPrecautions\nKey IDs configured on the sender and receiver of packets must correspond to the same authentication and encryption algorithms. Otherwise, packet transmission fails for not passing the authentication.\nIf algorithm is not configured, key-id will never be active."
