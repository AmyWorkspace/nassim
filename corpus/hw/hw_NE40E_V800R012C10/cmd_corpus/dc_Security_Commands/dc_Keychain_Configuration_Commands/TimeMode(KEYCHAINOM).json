    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEach keychain consists of multiple key IDs that are valid within different time periods and each key ID is configured with an authentication algorithm. When a key ID becomes valid, the corresponding authentication algorithm is used, ensuring the dynamic change of authentication algorithms. Configure different key IDs for packet sending and receiving to be valid within different time periods.\nTo configure the time mode for Keychain, run the time mode command. You can configure UTC or LMT for Keychain based on the network planning. Ensure that the time mode remains the same on the entire network."
