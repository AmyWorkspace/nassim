You can run the digest-length hmac-sha1-20 16 command to allow for interconnection with an earlier version. By default, the HMAC-SHA-256 and SHA-256 algorithms use a 32-byte digest for encryption and decryption. You can run the digest-length hmac-sha-256 16 or digest-length sha-256 16 command to allow for interconnection with an earlier version."
