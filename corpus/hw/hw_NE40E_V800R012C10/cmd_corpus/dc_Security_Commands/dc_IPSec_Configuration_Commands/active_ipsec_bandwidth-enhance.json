IPSec function cannot be used normally on VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VUSI-400A-S without activated license.\nAssume that the board is installed in slot 1. After you run the active ipsec bandwidth-enhance 40 slot 1 command to increase the bandwidth by 40 Gbit/s, the bandwidth of the board becomes 40 Gbit/s.\nPrerequisites\nThe license file that defines bandwidth resources has been activated."
