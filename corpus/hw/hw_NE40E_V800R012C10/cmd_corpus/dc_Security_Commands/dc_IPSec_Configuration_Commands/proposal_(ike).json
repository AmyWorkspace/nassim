    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nproposal command is used to bind IPSec proposal to the policy in ISAKMP mode or policy template.\nYou can configure maximum of 6 proposals and all the proposals should be negotiated during IKE negotiation.\nThe authentication algorithms MD5 and SHA1 have a low security, which may bring security risks. If protocols allowed, using more secure authentication algorithms, such as SHA2, is recommended.\nThe encryption algorithms DES/3DES have a low security, which may bring security risks. If protocols allowed, using more secure encryption algorithms, such as AES, is recommended.\nPrerequisites\nBefore using proposal command, the corresponding IPSec proposal must be configured using ipsec proposal command."
