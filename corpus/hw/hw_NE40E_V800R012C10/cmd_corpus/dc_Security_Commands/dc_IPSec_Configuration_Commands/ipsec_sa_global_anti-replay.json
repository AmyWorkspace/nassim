    "ExtraInfo": "During global inspection of packet sequence number, disable ipsec sa global anti-replay switch if there are packet loss and at the same time a lot of replay tunnel releases. If the number of tunnel replay packet loss is less, you can refer to the policy under heavy anti-reply switch.\nIf the current network is subjected to replay attacks, you can open the anti-replay switch. If the existing network scenario is more complex, such that the normal sequence of packets cannot be reached, you can turn off the anti-replay switch."
