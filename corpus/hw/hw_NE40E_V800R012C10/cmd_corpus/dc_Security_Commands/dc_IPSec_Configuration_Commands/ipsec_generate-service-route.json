    "ExtraInfo": "When IPSec tunnels are being established, data flows to be protected need to be defined. The IPSec service route information, such as the IP address and interface of the remote end of the tunnel, specifies which tunnels the protected data flow will enter. The ipsec generate-service-route command is mainly applied to the following two scenarios:\nWhen a security policy is used to establish IPSec tunnels, you may not know the IPSec service route information of the remote end (such as the IP address and interface of the remote end). Therefore, static routes cannot be configured manually. In this case, run the ipsec generate-service-route command to enable the function of automatic IPSec service route generation.When IPSec tunnels are established using a security policy, IPSec service routes will be generated during the IPSec negotiation. If you want to generate an IPSec service route by configuring static routes, you can run the undo ipsec generate-service-route command to disable the function of automatic IPSec service route generation first."
