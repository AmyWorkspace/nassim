    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen multiple tunnels are established on device, traffic conflicts occur when the data flow is heavy. By configuring the speed-limit command, you can limit packet traffic over each IPsec tunnel. The excessive traffic is discarded and hence traffic over each tunnel is transmitted.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
