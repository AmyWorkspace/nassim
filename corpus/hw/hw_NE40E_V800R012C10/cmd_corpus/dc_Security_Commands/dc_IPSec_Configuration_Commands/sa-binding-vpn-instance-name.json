    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an IPSec multi-VPN scenario, an IPSec device is connected to multiple VPNs. To specify the mappings between IPSec tunnels and VPNs, run the sa binding command.\nAfter the sa binding command is run, the packets sent from the IPsec tunnel to which the IKE peer belongs are decrypted and forwarded to the specified VPN using the sa binding vpn-instance vpn-instance-name command.\nPrerequisites\nBefore associating a VPN instance with an SA, configure a VPN instance and attributes for the routes in the VPN instance."
