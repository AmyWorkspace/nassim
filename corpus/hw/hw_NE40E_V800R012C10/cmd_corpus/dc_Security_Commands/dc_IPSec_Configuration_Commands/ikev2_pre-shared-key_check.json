    "ExtraInfo": "When the security gateway and multiple base stations use the pre-shared key mode to negotiate an IPsec tunnel, the pre-shared key and security gateway can be used for identity authentication. If the ikev2 pre-shared-key check disable command is configured to disable the pre-shared key check function, the base stations and security gateway can successfully negotiate with no pre-shared key being configured.\nThe ikev2 pre-shared-key check disable command configuration takes effect only when no pre-shared key is configured."
