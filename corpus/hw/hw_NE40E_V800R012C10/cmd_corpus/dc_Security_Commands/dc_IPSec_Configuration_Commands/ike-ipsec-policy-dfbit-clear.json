    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ipsec fragmentation before-encryption command can be used to allow IPSec packets to be fragmented and then encrypted. If the ipsec fragmentation before-encryption command is run, the ipsec df-bit clear command must also be run to set the DF flag bit to 0 to enable IPSec packet fragmentation. If the ipsec fragmentation before-encryption command is not used together with the ipsec df-bit clear command, the DF flag bit in a packet may be set to 1 (indicating that IPSec packets cannot be fragmented), causing a configuration failure of the ipsec fragmentation before-encryption command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf both the ipsec df-bit clear and ipsec global df-bit clear commands are run, the ipsec global df-bit clear command preferentially takes effect.\nAfter the undo ipsec df-bit clear command is run, the ipsec global df-bit clear command configuration takes effect."
