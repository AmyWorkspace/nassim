    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBased on protocol packet encryption and authentication at the IP layer, IPsec ensures the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of protocol packets transmitted on networks. IPsec uses two protocols, AH and ESP, for protocol packet authentication and encryption.\nFollow-up Procedure\nConfigure the authentication algorithm for AH when AH is used.\nConfigure the authentication and encryption algorithms for ESP when ESP is used.\nPrecautions\nThe security protocols on both IPsec peers must be identical."
