    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe VSU not loaded with a GTL license does not support IPsec services.\nTo configure IPsec services on a VSU, purchase a valid GTL license and load the license to the VSU.\nPrerequisites\nA GTL license has been loaded to the CF card on the main control boards and has been activated using the license active command.\nPrecautions\nAfter the GTL license becomes invalid, purchase a valid GTL license in time because the GTL license expiration affects the IPsec function on a VSU."
