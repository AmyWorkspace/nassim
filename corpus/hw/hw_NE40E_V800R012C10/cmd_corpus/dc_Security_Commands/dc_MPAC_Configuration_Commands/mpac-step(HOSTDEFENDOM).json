    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA rule step is the difference between two automatically allocated rule numbers. If the step is set to 5, the system automatically allocates rule numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, and so on.\nUsing a rule step, you can maintain the rules and add new rules conveniently.\nPrerequisites\nAn MPAC policy has been created using the service-security policy command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the step is configured for rules in an MPAC policy, the numbers of all rules are re-organized based on the new step.\nPrecautions\nThe step command configuration triggers the change of rule numbers but not the rule priorities."
