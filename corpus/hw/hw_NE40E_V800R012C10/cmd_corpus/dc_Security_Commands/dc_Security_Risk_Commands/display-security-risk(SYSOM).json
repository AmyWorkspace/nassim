    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nProtocols have different security performances, and some protocols may have security risks. Run the display security risk command to identify security risks in the system. Then clear the security risks according to the repair action in the command output. For example, if SNMPv1 is configured, the display security risk command output will prompt for the use of SNMPv3.\nYou can filter the security risks by specifying the security level, feature, type, or all.\nPrecautions\nThe security risks that are displayed vary with user levels. The system administrators can view all security risks in the system. Other users can only view the security risks whose level is lower than or equal to their levels."
