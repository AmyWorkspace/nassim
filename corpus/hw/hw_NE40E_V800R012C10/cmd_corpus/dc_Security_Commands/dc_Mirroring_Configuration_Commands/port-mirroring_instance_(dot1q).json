Based on different encapsulation types of an EVC Layer 2 sub-interface, specific packets on the mirrored port are copied to the observing port.\nIf the encapsulation type of an EVC Layer 2 sub-interface is dot1q, packets are copied to the observing port based on the VLAN range.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter mirroring is enabled, specific packets will be copied to the observing port, affecting the processing of normal service packets.\nPrecautions\nThe command only support When the encapsulation type of an EVC Layer 2 sub-interface is dot1q.\nAn EVC sub-interface can function only as a mirrored port, not an observing port."
