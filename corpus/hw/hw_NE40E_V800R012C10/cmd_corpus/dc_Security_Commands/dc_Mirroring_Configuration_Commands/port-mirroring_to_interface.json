    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn any earlier version, configuring port mirroring is complex and requires the following operations:\nRun the port-observing observe-index command to configure the observing port.Run the port-mirroring { inbound [ cpu-packet ] | outbound } [ user-defined-filter ] command to configure the mirrored port.Run the port-mirroring to { observe-index | null0 } command to configure the observing port for mirroring.\nTo simplify port mirroring configuration, the preceding commands have been integrated into the port-mirroring to interface command.\n\nPrecautions\nPackets received on an interface can be mirrored to an observing port on any interface board. To be specific, the observing port can be on the local interface board or a different one. If observing ports are specified both on an interface and on an interface board, the traffic on the interface is mirrored to the observing port specified on the interface."
