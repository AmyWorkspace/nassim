    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo view mirroring statistics on a specified interface, run the display port-mirroring interface verbose command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on mirroring-capable interfaces. If this command is run on a main interface, the command takes effect only on the main interface but not on its sub-interfaces.\nMirroring statistics can be queried and cleared only on mirroring-capable interfaces. In shared mode, statistics to be queried and cleared are shared ones."
