    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an observing port to mirror packets including the link layer header, run the port-observing with-linklayer-header command on the observing port.\nPrerequisites\nAn observing port has been configured.\nPrecautions\nOnly sub-interfaces support this command.\nWhen a main interface is used as the observing port for local mirroring, you do not need to run this command. The observing port mirrors packets including their link layer headers."
