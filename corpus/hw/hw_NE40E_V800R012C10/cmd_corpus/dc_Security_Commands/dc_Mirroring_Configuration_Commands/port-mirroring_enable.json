    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen refined control is required for the packets sent to the analyzer, you can use both mirroring and traffic classification. In this manner, only the packets that meet the specific conditions are mirrored, thus improving the efficiency of the packet analyzer.\nPrerequisites\nA traffic behavior is configured and the traffic behavior view is displayed.\nFollow-up Procedure\nThere is no particular sequence required for configuring the observing port and observing port for the interface board and enabling the flow mirroring function. All these configurations, however, must be complete before implementing the mirroring function."
