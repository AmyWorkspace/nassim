    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the apply traffic-action sample command is configured in a BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route, sampling is implemented for matching packets. After that, sampled packets are detected to identify and filter out abnormal packets. This protects devices against attacks and enhance network security.\nPrerequisites\nA static BGP IPv6 Flow Specification route has been created using the flow-route command in the system view."
