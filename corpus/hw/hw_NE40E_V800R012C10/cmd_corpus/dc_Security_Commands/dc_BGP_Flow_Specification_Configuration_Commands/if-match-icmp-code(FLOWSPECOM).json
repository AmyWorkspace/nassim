    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve network performance or security, you can run the if-match icmp-type and if-match icmp-code commands to configure a filtering rule related to an ICMP packet for a BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route to control traffic. There are two situations:\nOn a secure network, routers can receive ICMP packets. However, when network traffic load is heavy, host unreachable or port unreachable events frequently occur, and routers receive a large number of ICMP packets, increasing network burdens and degrading router performance.On an insecure network, network attackers often use ICMP error packets to spy on the internal structure of the network.\n\nPrerequisites\nA static BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route has been created using the flow-route command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of five filtering rules based on the code in ICMP packets can be configured for a BGP Flow Specification route."
