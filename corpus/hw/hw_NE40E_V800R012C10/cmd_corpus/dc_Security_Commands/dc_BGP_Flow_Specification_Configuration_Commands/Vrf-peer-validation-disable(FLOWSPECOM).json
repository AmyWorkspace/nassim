    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen receiving a BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification route with the filtering rule of a destination address, a BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification peer must check the validity of the route. The route is considered valid only if it complies with the authentication rule.\nThe authentication rule defines that when a BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification peer receives a BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification route with the filtering rule of a destination address, the peer searches its IP routing table for an optimal unicast route based on the destination address. If the unicast route is a BGP or VPN route and the initiators of the unicast route and the BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification route are the same, the BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification route is authenticated.\nIf you determine to control traffic destined for a specified address and BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification routes carrying the traffic control rule fail to pass authentication, the peer validation-disable command can be used to disable the corresponding device from authenticating the BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification routes.\nPrerequisites\nA BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification peer relationships have been configured.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the peer validation-disable command is run on a BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification peer, the BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification peer will not authenticate any received BGP Flow Specification or BGP VPN Flow Specification route. Exercise caution when running this command."
