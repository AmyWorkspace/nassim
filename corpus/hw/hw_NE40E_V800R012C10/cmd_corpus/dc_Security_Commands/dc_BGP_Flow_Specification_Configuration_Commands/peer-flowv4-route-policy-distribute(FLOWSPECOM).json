    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the RR+ solution, the controller delivers BGP FlowSpec routes that carry the RPD attribute to forwarders. Upon receipt, forwarders convert those that have only the destination IP address specified to common IP routes to guide traffic forwarding. This implementation allows traffic to travel along the optimal path determined by the controller.\nTo enable a BGP device serving as a forwarder to support the preceding scenario, run the peer capability-advertise route-policy-distribute receive command."
