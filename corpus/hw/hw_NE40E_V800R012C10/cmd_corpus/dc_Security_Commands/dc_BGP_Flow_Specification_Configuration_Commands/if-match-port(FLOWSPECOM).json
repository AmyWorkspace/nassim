    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe if-match port command is used to configure a filtering rule based on the port number for a BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route. The traffic behavior specified in the apply clause applies to the traffic whose source or destination port number matches the specified port number.\nPrerequisites\nA static BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route has been created using the flow-route command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nMake sure that the port number is within the range, because if the port number is beyond the range, protocol packets sent or received by the port cannot be forwarded.\nA maximum of five filtering rules based on the port number can be configured for a BGP Flow Specification route."
