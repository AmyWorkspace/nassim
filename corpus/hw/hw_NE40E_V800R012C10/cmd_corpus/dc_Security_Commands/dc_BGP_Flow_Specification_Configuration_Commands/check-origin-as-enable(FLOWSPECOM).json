    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBGP Flow Specification peers can advertise a filtering rule that is based on the origin AS number of the destination IP address. To allow the received BGP Flow Specification routes carrying a filtering rule that is based on the origin AS number of the destination IP address to be valid, run the check-origin-as enable command.\nPrecautions\nIf the check-origin-as enable command is not configured, the device considers the received BGP Flow Specification routes carrying a filtering rule that is based on the origin AS number of the destination IP address invalid."
