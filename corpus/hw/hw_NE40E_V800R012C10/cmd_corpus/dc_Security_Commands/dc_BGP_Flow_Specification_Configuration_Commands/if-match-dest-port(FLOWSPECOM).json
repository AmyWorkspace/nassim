    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe if-match destination-port command is used to configure a filtering rule based on the destination port number for a BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route. Traffic matching the filtering rule will be controlled with the action specified by the apply clause.\nPrerequisites\nA static BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route has been created using the flow-route command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nMake sure that the destination port number is within the range, because if the destination port number is beyond the range, the destination port cannot receive protocol packets; A maximum of five filtering rules based on the destination port number can be configured for a BGP Flow Specification route."
