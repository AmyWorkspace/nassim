    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the redirect ip recursive-lookup tunnel command is run, the received routes that carry a redirection extended community attribute preferentially recurse to tunnel. If the tunnel is reachable, they are used for forwarding; if the tunnel is unreachable, these received routes recurse to other routes.\nPrerequisites\nThe BGP FlowSpec peer has been enabled to advertise routes that carry a redirection extended community attribute.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe SRv6 TE Policy or SRv6 TE Policy Group of tunnel is not supported in a tunnel selector specified in the command."
