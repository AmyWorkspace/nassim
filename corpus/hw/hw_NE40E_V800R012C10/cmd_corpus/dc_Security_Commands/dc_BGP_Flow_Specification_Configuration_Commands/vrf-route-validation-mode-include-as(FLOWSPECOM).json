    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBGP Flow Specification routes are verified as follows:\nMode 1: After receiving a BGP Flow Specification route with a destination address as the filtering rule, the device verifies the route according to Figure 1. The route is considered valid only if the verification succeeds.Mode 2: After receiving a BGP Flow Specification route with a destination address as the filtering rule, the device verifies the route by checking whether the AS_Path attribute of the route carries the AS_Set or AS_Sequence field. The route is considered valid only if its AS_Path attribute does not carry the AS_Set or AS_Sequence field.If the\n\nroute validation-mode include-as command is run on a device, the device first uses mode 2 to verify BGP Flow Specification routes.\nIf the verification using mode 2 succeeds, the BGP Flow Specification route is considered valid, and the device no longer verifies the routes using mode 1.If the verification using mode 2 fails, the device verifies the routes using mode 1.If the\n\nroute validation-mode include-as command is not run on a device, the device uses mode 1 to verify BGP Flow Specification routes."
