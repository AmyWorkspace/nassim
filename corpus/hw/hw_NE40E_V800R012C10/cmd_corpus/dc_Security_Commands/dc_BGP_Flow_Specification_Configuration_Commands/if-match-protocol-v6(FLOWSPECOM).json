Traffic matching the filtering rule will be controlled with the action specified by the apply clause.\nPrerequisites\nA static BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route has been created using the flow-route command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of five filtering rules based on the IP protocol type can be configured for a BGP Flow Specification route."
