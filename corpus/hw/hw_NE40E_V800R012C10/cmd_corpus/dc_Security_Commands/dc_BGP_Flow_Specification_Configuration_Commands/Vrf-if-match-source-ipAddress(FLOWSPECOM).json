Traffic matching the filtering rule will be controlled with the action specified by the apply clause.\nPrerequisites\nA static BGP Flow Specification route has been created using the flow-route command in the system view.\nA static BGP VPN Flow Specification route has been configured using the flow-route vpn-instance command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf you run the if-match source command for the same BGP Flow Specification route or BGP VPN Flow Specification route several times, the last configuration takes effect."
