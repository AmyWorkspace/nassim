    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe reset bgp command is used to make new BGP configurations take effect.\nIf a BGP routing policy is configured on the router that does not support Route-Refresh, the reset bgp command can be used to make the new routing policy to take effect.\nConfiguration Impact\nThis command resets all TCP connections established between BGP peers and therefore results in the re-establishment of the BGP peer relationships. Exercise caution when running this command."
