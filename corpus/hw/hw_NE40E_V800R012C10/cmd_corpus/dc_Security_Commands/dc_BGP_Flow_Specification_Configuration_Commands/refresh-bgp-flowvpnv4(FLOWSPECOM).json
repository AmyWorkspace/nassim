    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a device's peer supports route-refresh, the refresh bgp command can be used on the device to softly reset the BGP connection with the peer. BGP soft resetting can be used to refresh the BGP routing table and apply new routing policies, without closing any BGP connection.\nPrerequisites\nConfiguring BGP soft resetting requires that the peers support the route-refresh capability.\nPrecautions\nAssume that a device supports route-refresh and is configured with the peer keep-all-routes command. After the refresh bgp command is run on the device, the device does not refresh its routing table."
