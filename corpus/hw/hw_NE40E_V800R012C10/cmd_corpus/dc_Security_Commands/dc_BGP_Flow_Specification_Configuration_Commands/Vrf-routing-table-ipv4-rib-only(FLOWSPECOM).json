This command can be used when the BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route attribute does not need to take effect on a local device.\nWhen route-policy-name or route-filter-name is specified in the command, the routes matching the policy are not added to the FES forwarding table, and the routes not matching the policy are added to the FES forwarding table."
