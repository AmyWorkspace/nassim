    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWithout a BGP Flow Specification interface group, the traffic filtering rules configured for BGP Flow Specification routes take effect globally, not on a specified interface. If a BGP Flow Specification interface group is configured, the traffic filtering rules configured for BGP Flow Specification routes also take effect on a specified interface. In this manner, traffic can be forwarded based on the rules of the BGP Flow Specification routes on the specified interface.\nAfter a BGP Flow Specification interface group is created using the flow-interface-group command, you can run the description command to configure a description for the group or modify an existing description for easier identification."
