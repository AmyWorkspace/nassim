    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, statistics about traffic matching the filtering rule in the BGP Flow Specification route contain only statistics about traffic matching the ACL rule of BGP Flow Specification. When BGP Flow Specification is configured and the action is set to CAR or deny, to enable the CAR statistics and packet loss statistics function for BGP flow specification, run the flowspec statistic enable command. After enabling the CAR statistics and packet loss statistics function for BGP flow specification, you can run the display flowspec statistics command to check CAR statistics.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThis command collects only statistics about traffic to which the CAR or deny action configured in BGP Flow Specification applies but not collects statistics based on ACL rule matching."
