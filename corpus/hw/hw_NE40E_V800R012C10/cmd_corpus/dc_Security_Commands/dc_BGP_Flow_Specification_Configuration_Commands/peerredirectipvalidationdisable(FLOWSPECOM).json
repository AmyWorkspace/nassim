    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, a device validates the routes that carry a redirection extended community attribute and are received from EBGP peers. To disable such route validation, run the peer redirect ip validation-disable command.\nTo verify the next hop address for redirection, check whether the redirection next hop received from the BGP Flow Specification peer exists in the routes received by the IPv4 address family peer. If the next hop exists in the routes and the IPv4 address family peer is the same as the BGP Flow Specification peer, the next hop address is verified."
