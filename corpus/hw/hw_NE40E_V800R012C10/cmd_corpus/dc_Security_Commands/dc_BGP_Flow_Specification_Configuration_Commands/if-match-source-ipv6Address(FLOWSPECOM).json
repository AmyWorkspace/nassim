    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo filter out the attack traffic to a specified destination, you can run the if-match source command to configure a filtering rule based on the source address for the BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route. Traffic matching the filtering rule will be controlled with the action specified by the apply clause.\nPrerequisites\nA static BGP Flow Specification IPv6 route has been created using the flow-route ipv6 command in the system view.\nA static BGP IPv6 VPN Flow Specification route has been configured using the flow-route ipv6 vpn-instance command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf you run the if-match source command for the same BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route several times, the last configuration takes effect."
