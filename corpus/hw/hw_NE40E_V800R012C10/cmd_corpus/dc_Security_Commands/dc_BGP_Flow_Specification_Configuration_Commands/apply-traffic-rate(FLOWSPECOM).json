    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the apply traffic-rate command is configured for a BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route, the rate of the traffic matching a filtering rule is limited to protect the target device from attacks, and to ensure network security.\nPrerequisites\nA BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route has been configured using the flow-route command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the apply traffic-rate command is run multiple times for the same BGP (IPv6) Flow Specification route or BGP (IPv6) VPN Flow Specification route, only the latest configuration takes effect.\nPrecautions\nBGP IPv6 FLOW Specification does not support next hop IPv6 addresses for redirection."
