    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nGenerally, when receiving a packet, a router obtains the destination address of the packet and searches the forwarding table for a route to the destination address. If a route to the destination address is found, the packet is forwarded; otherwise, the packet is discarded. When a packet is received on a URPF-enabled interface, the interface obtains the source address and inbound interface of the packet, takes the source address as the destination address to search for the corresponding inbound interface, and then compares the found interface with the inbound interface. If the two interfaces do not match, the interface considers the source address as a spoofing one and discards the packet. In this manner, URPF can effectively protect against malicious attacks by blocking packets with bogus source addresses.\nIf all packets on an interface need to be checked by URPF, URPF is enabled on the interface."
