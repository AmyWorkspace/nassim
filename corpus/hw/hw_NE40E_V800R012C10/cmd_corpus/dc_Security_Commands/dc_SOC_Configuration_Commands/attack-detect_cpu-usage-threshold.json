    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe security Operating Center (SOC) determines whether the system is being attacked based on the CPU usage. To correctly detect attacks on a live network, you must set proper CPU usage thresholds for security attack events. The interface board CPU usage of boards vary for different networkings in different scenarios. Therefore, in special cases, you need to change the threshold to accurately determine attack events.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nIf the configured CPU usage threshold is too high, some minor security attack events may fail to be detected. If the configured CPU usage threshold is too low, some security attack events may be mistakenly reported, affecting network maintenance and management. Therefore, set the CPU usage threshold based on accumulated experience to minimize the negative impact of parameter configuration."
