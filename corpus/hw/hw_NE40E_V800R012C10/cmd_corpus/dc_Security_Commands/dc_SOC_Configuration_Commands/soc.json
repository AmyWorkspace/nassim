    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAttack detection and attack source tracing are key SOC functions and must be enabled for the SOC to function.\nIf attack detection and attack source tracing have been enabled, running the soc command directly displays the SOC view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter attack detection and attack source tracing are enabled, when the CPU usage, the percentage of the number of invalid packets or sessions to the total number of packets or sessions, or packet loss rate exceeds the attack detection threshold, the SOC determines that the device is being attacked and starts attack source tracing. The SOC samples attack packets, analyzes collected data, and determines the attack events based on the preconfigured thresholds for determining the location, cause, and probability of the attack events. Then the SOC generates attack event reports and also generates an alarm for each attack event.\nAfter attack detection and attack source tracing are disabled, the SOC still collects data but neither performs attack detection and attack source tracing nor generates alarms.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
