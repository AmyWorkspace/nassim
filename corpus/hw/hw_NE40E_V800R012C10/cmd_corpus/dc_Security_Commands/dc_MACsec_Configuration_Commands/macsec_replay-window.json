    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prevent against attacks based on repeatedly sent data packets, the receiver discards duplicate or out-of-order data packets by default. In some cases, however, because the priorities of data packets are different, the packets are reordered in the forwarding process. When the packets arrive at the receive end, they are in disorder. To ensure that these out-of-order data packets can be received normally, configure the replay protection window."
