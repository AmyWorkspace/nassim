    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhether to copy the multicast data depends on the networking environment. The details are as follows:\nIn the single-edge networking, the device performs virtual scheduling of multicast traffic and forwards the traffic. The device copies the data from the multicast source and sends the copy to lower-layer devices. Therefore, configure the device to copy multicast data in this case.In the dual-edge networking, the device on one edge performs virtual scheduling of multicast traffic, and thus the received data is only used for bandwidth statistics rather than data replication and forwarding. Therefore, you need to run the multicast without-forwarding command to disable the device from copying multicast data. The device on the other edge takes charge of forwarding multicast data."
