    "ExtraInfo": "By default, multicast virtual scheduling does not enable the device to schedule multicast and unicast traffic on different VPNs. To schedule the unicast and multicast traffic that are not on the same VPN, run the multicast virtual-scheduling-vpn command. This command binds a multicast user VPN to the AAA domain to which a unicast user VPN has been bound, thus implementing inter-VPN multicast virtual scheduling."
