Multicast shaping enabled in the system view and in the interface view is different in terms of the range of the function.\nIf you enable multicast shaping in the system view, all matching multicast traffic in the system is shaped. If you enable multicast shaping in the interface view, all matching traffic on the interface is shaped.\nPrecautions\nMulticast shaping cannot be configured on P2MP or mLDP tunnel egress nodes.\nMulticast shaping supports IPv4 multicast but does not support IPv6 multicast.\nMulticast shaping does not support LPU1T boards.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
