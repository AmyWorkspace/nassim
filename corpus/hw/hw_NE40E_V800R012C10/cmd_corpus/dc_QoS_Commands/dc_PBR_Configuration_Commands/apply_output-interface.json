Each node in each traffic policy for PBR is configured with rules and an action. The action is redirecting matching IP packets to an outbound interface.\nPrecautions\nThe outbound interface can only be a P2P TE Tunnel interface. If the tunnel type is changed , the configuration is deleted automatically for the PBR."
