To configure an ACL to filter packets, run the if-match acl command.\nPrerequisites\nAn advanced ACL has been created using the acl (advanced ACL view) command, and rules have been created using the rule (advanced ACL view) command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nConfigure an action for the PBR policy, and apply the PBR policy to an interface."
