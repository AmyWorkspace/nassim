    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the port-queue pq and port-queue wfq commands are run on a global-MP-group interface or an MP-group interface on a device to set the CIR and PIR in the percentage format, the device uses the percentage to calculate and deliver the traffic shaping rate. If physical interface bandwidth changes due to the status change (between Up and Down) of member links, using the percentage to calculate and deliver the traffic shaping rate affects the operating of other modules. The port-queue dynamic command can be used to enable the device to dynamically adjust the traffic shaping rate so that this problem is resolved.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the port-queue dynamic command is run on a device, the device will dynamically adjust the traffic shaping rate based on physical interface bandwidth changes caused by the status change (between Up and Down) of member links."
