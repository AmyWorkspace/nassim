    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe WFQ queue scheduling mode of an interface can be set to Weight or CIR. To set the WFQ queue scheduling mode of an interface to Weight, run the set port-queue weight-mode command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the command is executed, all configurations of the original mode are cleared, and the default value of the current mode is restored.\nAfter this command is executed, you can run the port-queue wfq weight command to configure WFQ scheduling parameters, including the weight and shaping rate, for an outbound port queue on an interface.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the following subcards:\n2-Port Channelized STM-1c POS-SFP Flexible Card (P50)4-Port Channelized STM-1c POS-SFP Flexible Card (P50)8-Port Channelized STM-1c POS-SFP Flexible Card (P50)"
