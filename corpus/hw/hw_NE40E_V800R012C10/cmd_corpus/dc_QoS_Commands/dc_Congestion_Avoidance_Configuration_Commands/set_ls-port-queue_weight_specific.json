    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe set ls-port-queue weight specific is used to adjust the CIR and PIR percentage of flows on all Global-MP-interfaces. By default, the weighted CIR of BE, AF1, AF2, AF3, and AF4 flows are respectively 15%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 25% of the interface bandwidth. Using the set ls-port-queue weight specific command will adjust the CIR percentages respectively to 5%, 5%, 10%, 40%, and 40%, while the undo set ls-port-queueweight specific command will restore the CIR percentages respectively to 15%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 25%.\nConfiguration Impact\nThis command must be configured before the Global-MP-Interface is created. If CIR and PIR percentage of flows on all Global-MP-interfaces needs to be adjusted for system software upgrade, you can write the command into the configuration file for the next startup before starting the device."
