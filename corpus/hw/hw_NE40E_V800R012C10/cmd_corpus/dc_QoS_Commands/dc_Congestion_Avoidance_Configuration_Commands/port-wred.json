    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf you need to set different upper and lower drop thresholds for packets of different colors in queues, run the port-wred command to create a port-WRED profile.\nConfiguration Impact\nPackets of different colors in port queues are processed based on the upper drop threshold, lower drop threshold, and drop probability in a configured WRED profile.\nFollow-up Procedure\nConfigure an upper drop threshold, a lower drop threshold, and a drop probability, and then apply them to port queues.\nPrecautions\nThe system has a default WRED object. If no user-defined WRED object can be used, the default WRED object is used."
