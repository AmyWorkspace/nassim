    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDiff-Serv models include Pipe, Short Pipe, and Uniform.\nIn the Pipe model, the EXP value in the label assigned by the ingress PE to the packet is determined by the user-defined parameters. Before the packet leaves the MPLS network, the MPLS label is popped out, but the DSCP value of the IP packet remains unchanged. The egress PE then forwards the packet based on the EXP value in the MPLS label.In short-pipe mode, the EXP value assigned by the ingress to a packet is determined by the user-defined parameters. When the packet leaves the MPLS network, the egress removes the MPLS label, but the DSCP value of the IP packet remains unchanged. The egress forwards the packet based on the trust field in the MPLS label. If no trust field is configured, the egress forwards the packet based on its VLAN priority. If the packet does not have a VLAN priority, the egress forwards the packet based on its IP DSCP value.In uniform mode, the EXP value assigned by the ingress is determined by the inbound queue and egress DS domain. When the packet leaves the MPLS network, the egress removes the MPLS label and maps the EXP value to the DSCP value of the IP packet. The egress then forwards the packet based on the mapped DSCP value.\nWhen you configure the service type of packets transmitted from a private network to the public network:\nConfigure the service type as cs7 or cs6 to send signaling protocol packets.Configure the service type as ef to ensure low latency.Configure the service type as af4, af3, af2, or af1 to ensure the bandwidth key data.Configure the service type as be for the best effort delivery without strict QoS assurance.\nThe preceding service types are listed in the descending order of sending priorities.\nThe colors of the packets sent from private network to the public network are arranged in the ascending order of the discard priorities, specifically, green, yellow, and red.\n\nPrecautions\nThe Pipe or Short Pipe model has high priority over the simple or forcible traffic classification.\nThe complex traffic classification has high priority over the Pipe or Short Pipe model.\nThe diffserv-mode ingress egress command and diffserv-mode command can overwrite each other. The two commands provide the same function. The only difference is that the diffserv-mode ingress egress command allows you to configure different DiffServ modes on the ingress and egress, whereas the diffserv-mode command allows you to configure only the same DiffServ mode on the ingress and egress.\nVXLAN does not support Pipe/Short-pipe mode. A VSI that is added to a VXLAN cannot be configured to work in Pipe/Short-pipe mode. A VSI that is configured to work in Pipe/Short-pipe mode cannot be added to a VXLAN."
