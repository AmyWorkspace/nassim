If the step value is set to 5, the sub-policies are numbered in the manner of 5, 10, and 15.\nBy default, the step is set to 1 for sub-policies.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run this command to set the step value and configure new sub-policies between sub-policies according to the priorities. For example, if four sub-policies are configured and their priorities are 0, 5, 10, and 15, you can run the classifier  behavior precedence 1 command to insert a sub-policy of the priority 1 between the sub-policies of the priority 0 and the priority 5.\nPrerequisites\nA traffic policy is created.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe step command can be used to adjust the priorities of sub-policies.\nPrecautions\nThe step command can change the priorities of configured sub-policies rather than change the matching order of sub-policies."
