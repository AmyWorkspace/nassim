    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command is used to specify the CoS of the queue that the upstream traffic on an interface enters to implement congestion avoidance. In the DiffServ model, the system reserves eight service queues for each port, and their CoSs are respectively BE, AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4, EF, CS6, and CS7. For the queue whose CoS is AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4, or BE, WFQ is used to assign bandwidth to queue taking part in the scheduling according to the weights of the queues by default. For the queue whose CoS is EF, CS6, or CS7, PQ scheduling is configured by default.\nIf the qos default-service-class command is run on an interface for incoming traffic for multiple times, the last configuration takes effect. After this command is executed, other queue configuration commands cannot be enabled. This command is mutually exclusive with BA classification command."
