    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe trust 8021p vlan command is used to configure a simple traffic classification-based QoS policy on a Layer 2 interface.\nFor the inbound interface traffic, the command is executed when the 802.1p field of packets is need to map to the internal priorities. For the outbound interface traffic, the command is executed when 802.1p field of packets is need to modify.\nIf the inbound and outbound parameters are not specified. the command takes effect on both inbound and outbound interface traffic.\nPrecautions\nThe trust inner-8021p inbound command is mutually exclusive with the qos default-service-class command.\nBefore running the trust 8021p vlan command on an interface, use the trust upstream vlan command to bind a DS domain to the interface. Otherwise, the trust 8021p vlan configuration does not take effect."
