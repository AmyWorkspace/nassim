    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter VPN is configured on a device, VPN services can be forwarded using only private network routes. When public network users require VPN services or VPN services access the public network, to redirect IPv4 or IPv6 packets to be forwarded using private network routes to public network routes' outbound interfaces, run the redirect ip public-network command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is effective only in the traffic policy applied to incoming packets."
