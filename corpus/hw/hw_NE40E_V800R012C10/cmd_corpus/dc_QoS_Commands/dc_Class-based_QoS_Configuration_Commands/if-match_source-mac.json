    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a certain traffic policy for the traffic with a certain source MAC address, you can run this command in the traffic classifier view to configure a matching rule for complex traffic classification based on the source MAC address. Then, you need to configure the corresponding traffic behavior and traffic policy, and apply the policy to interfaces.\nPrerequisites\nA traffic classifier is configured in the system view and the traffic classifier view is displayed.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe traffic action in the traffic behavior bound to the traffic classifier is performed for the traffic matching the specified source MAC address.\nFollow-up Procedure\nYou need to configure the traffic behavior and traffic policy, bind the traffic behavior to the traffic classifier in the traffic policy, and apply the traffic policy to interfaces.\nPrecautions\nThe matching rule based on the source MAC addresses of packets is valid for only inbound policies.\nThis command can be used to set more than one source MAC address for one traffic classifier to match the packets with different source MAC addresses."
