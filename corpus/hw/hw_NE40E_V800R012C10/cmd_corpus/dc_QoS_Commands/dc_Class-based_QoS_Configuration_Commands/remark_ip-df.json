    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the length of a packet is greater than the MTU value of the interface, and the DF field value of the packet is 1, the packet is discarded, which may cause service interruption. In this case, you can run this command to re-set the value of the DF field to make the packet fragmentable.\nPrecautions\nThe remark ip-df command is applied only to incoming packets. This command is used to set the DF field in the packets to 0 or 1, which indicates that the packet can or cannot be fragmented during transmission.\nThis command re-marks only the outermost label of packets."
