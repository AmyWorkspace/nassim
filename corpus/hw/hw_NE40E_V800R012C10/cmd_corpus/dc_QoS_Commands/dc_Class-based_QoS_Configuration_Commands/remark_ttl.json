    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn most schools, especially in dormitories, many students dial up to go online using IPoE and use the wireless router or adapter to provide Internet services through NAT. This may lead to the following problems:\nThe school's revenue decreases when students share their monthly-paid Internet services.The real-name based Internet access is difficult to implement, which troubles network management.The wireless campus Internet environment deteriorates and is difficult to construct.\nTo prevent these problems, run the remark ttl command to set the TTL value to 1. The TTL value of a packet decreases by 1 when the packet passes through a router. Once the TTL value is set to 1, the TTL value of the packets that passing through the private router will become 0, causing the packets to be dropped.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe traffic behavior view has been displayed.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the remark ttl command is run repeatedly in the same traffic behavior view, the latest configuration overrides the previous configuration.\nPrecautions\nA traffic policy containing remark ttl is supported only in the outbound direction of an interface."
