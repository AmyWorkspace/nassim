    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo classify traffic based on the service class and execute different traffic behaviors, configure a matching rule for the traffic classifier based on the service class, associate the traffic classifier with a traffic behavior in a traffic policy, and apply the traffic policy to an interface. To configure a matching rule for the traffic classifier based on the service class, run the if-match service-class command.\nPrerequisites\nA traffic classifier has been configured in the system view and the traffic classifier view is displayed.\nFollow-up Procedure\nConfigure a traffic behavior and a traffic policy and associate the traffic classifier with the traffic behavior in the traffic policy.\nPrecautions\nThe service-class-based traffic classifier applies only to outgoing traffic. The traffic policy with the traffic classifier takes effect only when the link-layer or all-layer parameter is specified."
