    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo perform the traffic policy based on destination IP addresses of IPv6 packets, you can run this command in the traffic classifier view to configure a matching rule for the complex traffic classification based on destination IP addresses of IPv6 packets. Then, you need to configure the traffic behavior and traffic policy, and apply the policy to interfaces.\nPrerequisites\nA traffic classifier is configured in the system view and the traffic classifier view is displayed.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe traffic action in the traffic behavior bound to the traffic classifier is performed for the traffic matching the specified destination IPv6 address.\nFollow-up Procedure\nYou need to configure the traffic behavior and traffic policy, bind the traffic behavior to the traffic classifier in the traffic policy, and apply the traffic policy to interfaces.\nPrecautions\nThe matching of IPv6 destination addresses applies to both upstream and downstream traffic.\nYou can configure more than one destination IPv6 address in one traffic classifier to match IP packets with different destination IP addresses.\nAfter the configuration, destination IPv6 addresses are matched in the configuration order. A matching rule can be deleted only when the specified destination IPv6 address and mask length are the same as those that are specified in the matching rule. The deletion order can be different from the configuration order."
