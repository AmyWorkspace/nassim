    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the permit or deny action is configured in both the rule command and the traffic behavior view, only packets that are permitted by the rule command are processed according to the configured traffic behavior. If the deny action is configured in either the rule command or the traffic behavior view, all matched packets are discarded.\nPrerequisites\nA traffic behavior is configured and the traffic behavior view is displayed.\nPrecautions\nThe deny action is mutually exclusive with other traffic actions. You can apply other traffic actions to the traffic that has been configured with the deny action only after configuring the permit action for the traffic. If both the if-match any and deny commands are configured, the MF classification function prevents all packets from passing through an interface, including even protocol packets. Therefore, exercise caution when using combinations of the preceding commands."
