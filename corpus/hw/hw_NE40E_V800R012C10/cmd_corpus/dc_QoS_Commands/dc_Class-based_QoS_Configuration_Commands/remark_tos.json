    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ToS values of IP packets need to be re-marked in some cases. For example, if the service traffic received by an ingress has the ToS flag (the upstream domain is a ToS domain or users add the ToS flag to the traffic), the ingress needs to re-mark the ToS flag of the service traffic based on the SLA.\nIf the priority of an IPv4 packet that matches a traffic classifier needs to re-marked, the remark tos command can be used to re-mark the ToS value of the IPv4 packet in order to adjust the priority of the packet.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the remark tos command is run repeatedly in the same traffic behavior view, the latest configuration overrides the previous configuration.\nIf the remark dscp command has been run in the view of a traffic behavior, the remark dscp command configuration will be deleted after the remark tos command is run in the view of the traffic behavior."
