    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a device to re-mark the 802.1p value in the inner VLAN tag of double-tagged VLAN packets, run the remark inner-8021p command. After being re-marked, packets are placed in queues based on the new 802.1p values.\nPrerequisites\nA traffic behavior has been configured.\nConfiguration Impact\nPackets matching the traffic classifier are placed in queues based on the new 802.1p values in the inner VLAN tags.\nFollow-up Procedure\nConfigure a traffic policy and apply the traffic policy to an interface.\nIf a packet has two- or more-layered VLAN tags, the remark inner-8021p command re-marks only the 802.1p value in the second-layer VLAN tag, with the 802.1p values in the remaining VLAN tags remaining unchanged. If both the remark inner-8021p and remark outer-8021p commands are configured, packets are placed in queues based on the 802.1p values in the outer VLAN tags."
