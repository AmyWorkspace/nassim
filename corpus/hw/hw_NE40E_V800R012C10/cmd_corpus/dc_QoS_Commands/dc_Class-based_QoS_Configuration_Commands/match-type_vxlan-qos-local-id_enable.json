    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore configuring a matching rule based on a QoS policy ID in VXLAN packets in a traffic policy, run the match-type vxlan-qos-local-id enable command to enable the QoS policy ID matching mode for VXLAN packets. If the command is not run, the matching rule does not take effect.\nPrecautions\nThis command can be configured only in the traffic policy where traffic behaviors and classifiers are not associated.\nThis command cannot be configured repeatedly in the same traffic policy.\nAfter this command is configured in a traffic policy, the traffic policy cannot be configured with layer-related parameters.\nAfter this command is configured in a traffic policy, the traffic policy can be applied only to common interfaces/sub-interfaces, trunk interfaces/sub-interfaces, and Layer 2 interfaces.\nThis command and its undo form cannot be configured in a traffic policy that has been applied to an interface.\nThis command is supported only on the CR5D0EKGFA72, CR5DNKFEDY71, CR5D0EKXFC70, CR5D0EKGFC70, CR5DNKFEDY70, CR5D0EKGFA71, CR5DNKFEDY72."
