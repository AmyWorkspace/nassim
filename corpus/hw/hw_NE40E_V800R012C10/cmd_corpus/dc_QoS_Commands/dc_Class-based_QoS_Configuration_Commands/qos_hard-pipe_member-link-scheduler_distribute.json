    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe rate limit of each trunk member interface is the one configured on the trunk interface. In this case, the traffic rate on the trunk interface multiplies, and rate limiting fails.\nAfter the qos hard-pipe member-link-scheduler distribute command is configured, trunk member interfaces share the bandwidth configured on the trunk interface."
