Before running the redirect command, delete the existing redirect configuration.\nThe function of redirecting public-network IPv4/IPv6 packets to an SRv6 TE Policy applies only to inbound interfaces.\nThis command is not supported on LPUF-50/LPUF-50-L/LPUI-21-L/LPUI-51-L/LPUF-51/LPUF-51-B/LPUI-51/LPUI-51-B/LPUS-51/LPUF-101/LPUF-101-B/LPUI-101/LPUI-101-B/LPUS-101 boards."
