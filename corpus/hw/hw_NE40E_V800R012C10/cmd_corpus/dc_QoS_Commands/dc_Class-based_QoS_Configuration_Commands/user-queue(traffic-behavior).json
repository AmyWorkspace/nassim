    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRunning the user-queue command in the traffic behavior view means to perform class-based HQoS scheduling over the packets that match the traffic rules. The outgoing traffic supports class-based HQoS scheduling only when the traffic policy works in unshared mode and is applied to an ETM subcard.\nPrecautions\nIn the view of traffic behavior view, this command and car command are mutually exclusive.\nThe user-queue command cannot bind four-flow-queue in the traffic behavior view.\nIf member interfaces of a trunk interface reside on different forwarding or traffic management modules, the effective CIR or PIR for CAR or user-queue can be a multiple of the configured one."
