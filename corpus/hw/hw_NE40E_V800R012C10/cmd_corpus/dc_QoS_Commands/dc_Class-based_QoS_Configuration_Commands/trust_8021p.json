    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the trust 8021p command is run on an interface, the device maps the 802.1p value of packets into the internal priority when the interface functions as the inbound interface, and maps the internal priority of packets into the 8021.p value when the interface functions as the outbound interface.\nIf the inbound and outbound parameters are not specified, the command takes effect on both inbound and outbound interface traffic.\nPrerequisites\nBefore running this command on an interface, you need to run the trust upstream command to bind a DS domain to the interface. Otherwise, the configuration cannot take effect.\nPrecautions\nThe trust 8021p inbound command is mutually exclusive with the qos default-service-class command.\nThe inner-8021p and outer-8021p parameters are not supported on global-VE and PW-VE interfaces.\nThe inner-8021p and outer-8021p parameters are not supported on VBridge interfaces.\nThis configuration is  supported by global VE sub-interfaces rather than global VE interfaces."
