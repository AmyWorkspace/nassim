    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThere are VLL, VPLS, EVPN, local CCC, local VSI, VLAN, and L2TP services in Layer 2 MPLS forwarding scenarios. To implement MF classification for these packets, run the traffic-policy match-mpls-layer l2-inbound command to configure MF traffic classification based on MPLS information for outgoing traffic on the public network.\nPrecautions\nThe traffic-policy match-mpls-layer l2-inbound command takes effect for the entire board. Before running the traffic-policy match-mpls-layer l2-inbound or undo traffic-policy match-mpls-layer l2-inbound command, ensure the configurations on all interfaces are correct.\nIn VS mode, this command can be configured only in the admin VS and takes effect for all VSs."
