    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the global UCL and interface ACL rules take effect as follows:\n User-side upstream traffic can be matched against U2N rules in the global UCL but not U2U rules in the global UCL or interface ACL rules. User-side downstream traffic can be matched against N2U rules in the global UCL but not interface ACL rules. For network-side upstream traffic, the interface ACL takes precedence over the global UCL. If no interface ACL is configured, the global UCL takes effect. Traffic from the network side to the user side can be matched against N2U rules in the global UCL, and traffic from the network side to the network side can be matched against N2N rules in the global UCL. For network-side downstream traffic, the interface ACL takes precedence over the global UCL. If no interface ACL is configured, the global UCL takes effect. Network-side downstream traffic can only be matched against N2N rules in the global UCL.\nAfter you run the traffic-policy match-type destination-user inbound command in the slot view, the global UCL and interface ACL function as follows:\n User-side upstream traffic can be matched against both U2N and U2U rules in the global UCL but not interface ACL rules. User-side downstream traffic can be matched against N2U rules in the global UCL but not interface ACL rules. Network-side upstream traffic can be matched against global UCL rules but not interface ACL rules. Network-side downstream traffic can be matched against interface ACL rules but not global UCL rules.\nIn a U2U rule, the source and destination are both user groups.In a U2N rule, the source is a user group and the destination is an IP address.In an N2U rule, the source is an IP address and the destination is a user group.In an N2N rule, the source and destination are both IP addresses.\n\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThis command is mutually exclusive with the traffic-policy match-type interface-acl command."
