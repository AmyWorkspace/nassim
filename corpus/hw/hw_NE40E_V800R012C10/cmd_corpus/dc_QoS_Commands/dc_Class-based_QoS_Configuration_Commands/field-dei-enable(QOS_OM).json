    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe field dei enable command sets the capability of an interface to recognize the drop precedence of 802.1p packets. After this capability is assigned on an interface, the device can then identify the drop precedence of packets according to the CFI of the packet in the inbound or outbound direction of the interface. The packets with higher drop precedence are dropped first when a network is congested.\nThe Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI) and CFI share the same bit. If DEI is disabled, this bit is occupied by the CFI.\nThe DEI function takes effect only after simple traffic classification is configured and trust priority of 802.1p . After you enable DEI for an interface and configure simple traffic classification, packets enter queues based on CoSs and are marked with different colors based on the values of their CFI fields.\nWhen DEI is enabled, if the DEI value is 1, the packet is marked yellow; if the DEI value is 0, the packet is marked green.If DEI is disabled, the device maps the external priority of a packet to the internal priority based on the 802.1p value, regardless of whether the DEI value is 0 or 1. By default, all packets are marked green.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe DEI function takes effect only when the trust upstream command is run to configure BA classification and the trust 8021p command is run to trust 802.1p values of packets.\nPrecautions\nThis command can be configured only on Ethernet, trunk, and FlexE sub-interfaces. If this command is configured on global VE or VE sub-interfaces with dot1q VLAN tag termination, the configuration fails."
