    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo change the priority of a VLAN packet in the traffic classifier, you can run this command to re-mark the 802.1p value of the packet and adjust the priority of the packet.\nPrerequisites\nThe traffic behavior is configured.\nFollow-up Procedure\nThe traffic policy is configured and the policy is applied to interfaces.\nPrecautions\nThis command re-marks only the outermost label of packets.\nIf remark 8021p for incoming traffic is required, you need to run both the trust upstream default and trust 8021p commands for incoming traffic to implement the re-marking function."
