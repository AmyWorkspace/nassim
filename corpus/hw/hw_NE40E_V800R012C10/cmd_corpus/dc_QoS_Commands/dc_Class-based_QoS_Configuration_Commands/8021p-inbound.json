    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo implement QoS scheduling on the upstream VLAN packets, run the 8021p-inbound command to configure mapping relationships from 802.1p values of the VLAN packets in a DS domain to internal CoSs defined on the router and color the packets. After the DS domain is bound to the inbound interface of packets, QoS performs congestion management and avoidance based on the CoSs mapped to the packets.\nIf the CoS is CS6, CS7, EF, or BE, the packets can be colored only green.\nIf 8021p-value is not specified, you can run the undo 8021p-inbound command to restore all default mappings between 802.1p values and CoSs.\nIf no mapping between 802.1p values and CoSs is specified, the default mappings are adopted.\nTable 1 Default mappings between 802.1p values and CoSs802.1p\n\nService\n\nColor\n\n\n\n0\n\nbe\n\ngreen\n\n\n1\n\naf1\n\ngreen\n\n\n2\n\naf2\n\ngreen\n\n\n3\n\naf3\n\ngreen\n\n\n4\n\naf4\n\ngreen\n\n\n5\n\nef\n\ngreen\n\n\n6\n\ncs6\n\ngreen\n\n\n7\n\ncs7\n\ngreen\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf 8021p-value is not specified, you can run the undo 8021p-inbound command to restore all default mappings between 802.1p values and CoSs.If no mapping between 802.1p values and CoSs is specified, the default mappings are adopted.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
