    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA growing number of broadcast packets occupy a large amount of network resources. In this situation, services may not be provisioned properly.\nTo prevent broadcast storms, you can run the broadcast-suppression command to set thresholds for broadcast traffic that is allowed to pass through an interface. If the broadcast traffic volume exceeds the value set using the broadcast-suppression command, the system drops the excessive broadcast traffic.\nPrecautions\nThe command is valid only for broadcast traffics.\nThe broadcast suppression does not take effected in VLL scenario.\nIf the broadcast-suppression command is run for multiple times, the latest configuration overrides the previous ones.\nTo achieve accurate packet suppression, specify a value for the CBS that is over 10 times the length of the packet.\nCAR on a trunk interface:\nIf member interfaces of a trunk interface reside on different forwarding or traffic management modules, the effective CIR or PIR for CAR or user-queue can be a multiple of the configured one."
