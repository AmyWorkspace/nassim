If destination is specified in the command, the source address of routes advertised using BGP is used as the destination address of traffic.\nPrerequisites\nA QPPB local policy that defines the binding relationships between BGP routes and traffic behaviors has been configured.\nPrecautions\nThis command applies to VLAN-type dot1q sub-interfaces, dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces, and QinQ VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces.\nIf both a QPPB policy and a traffic policy are configured on an interface, the QPPB policy takes effect preferentially."
