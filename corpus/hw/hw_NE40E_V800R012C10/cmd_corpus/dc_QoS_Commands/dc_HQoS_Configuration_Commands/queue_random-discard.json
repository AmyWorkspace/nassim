When a flow queue configured with this command is applied to VE or global-VE interfaces, this command does not take effect. If the qos schedule-tree distribute-mode outbound command is run on an interface, the command does not take effect on the interface.\nThe P51-E/P101-E/LPUI-51-E subcards do not support this function. When a flow queue configured with this command is applied to these subcards, this command does not take effect."
