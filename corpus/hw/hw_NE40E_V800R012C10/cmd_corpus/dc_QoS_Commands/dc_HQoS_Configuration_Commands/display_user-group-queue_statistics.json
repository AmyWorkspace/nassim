    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe display user-group-queue statistics command displays statistics about GQs in a specific direction, which facilitates scheduling monitoring and fault locating.\nPrecautions\nWhen no slot is specified in the display user-group-queue statistics command, statistics about a GQ is displayed based on each board.\nWhen mode template is configured for a GQ, the GQ is instantiated based on the group in the QoS profile. Therefore, you must specify a group name to query the GQ statistics.\nWhen the first letter of parameters is c/n/s and a display command with name not being specified is run, the command association function may have other keywords displayed. For example, if the value of parameters is ccc and the display user-group-queue c ? command is run, the device automatically considers the command configuration as display user-group-queue configuration.\nWhen using the display user-group-queue statistics command, note that:\nIf the message \"Error: The specified board does not support this command\" is displayed, the board does not support this command. In this case, run the display user-group-queue statistics interface command to\nquery desired statistics.\nIf the message \"Error: Failed to obtain GQ resources\" is displayed, GQ resources fail to be applied for, or the board does not support this command. In this case, run the display user-group-queue statistics interface\ncommand to query desired statistics."
