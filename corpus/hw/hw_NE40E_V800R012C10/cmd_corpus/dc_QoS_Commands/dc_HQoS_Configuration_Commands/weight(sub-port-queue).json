    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMultiple services are scheduled evenly by default, making it possible that important services are not preferentially forwarded. You can run the weight command to modify scheduling weight values to ensure that services of high priorities are preferentially forwarded.\nPrerequisites\nA sub-interface queue profile has been configured.\nPrecautions\nSub-interface queues are allocated bandwidth using the following format: (weight / SUM weight) x higher-level traffic shaping value. When the sum bandwidth of a user group queue is greater than the traffic shaping value, the user group queue is allocated bandwidth equal to the traffic shaping value. The remaining bandwidth is allocated to other user group queues."
