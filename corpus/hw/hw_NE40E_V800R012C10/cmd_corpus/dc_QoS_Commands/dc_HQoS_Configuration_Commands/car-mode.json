    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the CAR mode for a flow queue with a specified priority, run the car-mode enable command. In CAR mode, a device does not cache user packets, reducing the delay. It is recommended that the CAR mode be enabled for flow queues that have high requirements on the delay.\nPrerequisites\nA flow queue profile in enhanced 8-CoS mode has been configured.\nPrecautions\nOnly LPUI-52/LPUF-53/LPUI-242/LPUF-243/LPUI-242-CM/LPUI-242-G/LPUI-402/LPUI-402-CM/LPUF-483/LPUI-2T-L/LPUI-2T-CM/LPUF-1T2 boards support a flow queue profile in enhanced 8-CoS mode.\nThe CAR mode can be enabled only for flow queues with CoS 5, CoS 6, and CoS 7.\nThe CAR mode takes effect only for downstream traffic."
