    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe flow-WRED object can be used to configure color-based drop policy and queue length.\nWith the flow-WRED object, you can set the lower and upper thresholds and drop probability for a queue. When the percentage of the actual queue length is smaller than the lower threshold, no packet is dropped. When the percentage of the actual queue length ranges from the lower threshold to the upper one, WRED randomly drops packets (the longer the queue, the higher the droop probability). When the percentage of the actual queue length is greater than the upper threshold, all packets are dropped.\nAfter a flow-WRED object is applied to a flow queue, different drop policies can be applied to packets of different colors in the flow queue.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf no flow-WRED object is configured for a user, the system tail drops packets by default.\nIf the specified wred-name does not exist, the system creates a new flow queue WRED object.\nIf the wred-name exists, the system enters the flow queue WRED view and then you can modify the parameters of it.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of 6144 flow-WRED objects can be created in the system.\nFlow-WRED objects that are applied to a flow queue profile cannot be deleted."
