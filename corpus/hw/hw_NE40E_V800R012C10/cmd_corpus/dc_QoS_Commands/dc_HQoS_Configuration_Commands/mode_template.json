    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a GQ is created, the GQ applies for QoS resources only when the qos-profile command is run in the interface view. If the mode template command is configured, GQs consume resources based on the keyword group of the qos-profile (interface view) command in the interface view; if the mode template command is not configured, GQs share the same QoS resources. Even though group is defined differently in multiple qos-profile (interface view) commands in the interface view, GQs share the same QoS resources.\nFor example, the qos-profile test inbound group group1 command is configured on GE 1/0/0 and the qos-profile test inbound group group2 command is configured on GE 1/0/1. If the mode template command is configured, GQs apply for two QoS resources; if the mode template command is not configured, GQs share the same QoS resources.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe mode template command configuration will affect resource allocation for GQs.\nPrecautions\nThe mode of the GQ that has been used cannot be modified."
