The parameters include the scheduling mode (PQ/WFQ/LPQ), shaping value, buffer size (PBS), and discard policy (WRED). For example, to allocate a high priority to voice services and ensure low delay, configure PQ for voice services and set a proper flow-WRED profile.\nTable 1 Default FQ Profile Configuration in 4-CoS ModeFlow Queue\n\nMapped 8-CoS Priority\n\nScheduling Mode\n\nWeight\n\nShaping Percentage\n\nDrop Method\n\n\n\ncos0\n\nBE,AF1\n\nWFQ\n\n10\n\n-\n\nTail drop\n\n\ncos1\n\nAF2,AF3,AF4\n\nWFQ\n\n15\n\n-\n\nTail drop\n\n\ncos2\n\nEF\n\nPQ\n\n-\n\n-\n\nTail drop\n\n\ncos3\n\nCS6,CS7\n\nPQ\n\n-\n\n-\n\nTail drop\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nA 4-CoS flow queue profile has been created using the flow-queue 4cos-mode command.\nThe required WRED profile has been created.\nConfiguration Impact\nQueue scheduling of services is affected.\nPrecautions\nConfiguring different WRED profiles for flow queues of different service types is recommended.\nParameters in this command do not need to be configured in a specific order.
