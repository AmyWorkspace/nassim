    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen using the display flow-queue configuration command displays the flow queue template in three situations:\nIf you run the display flow-queue configuration command, the system displays the summary of all the flow queue templates.If you run the display flow-queue configuration verbose command, the system displays detailed information about all the flow queue templates.If you run the display flow-queue configuration verbose flow-queue-name command, the system displays details of the specified flow queue template.\nIf no flow queue template has been created with the flow-queue command, you are notified by a message indicating that the number of flow queue templates is 0 when you run this command.\nThe relationships between the U-weight, the I-weight, and the A-weight are as follows:\nU-weight: is the WFQ weight set by a user.I-weight: is the inversely proportional WFQ weight worked out through a weight algorithm. The WFQ weight is actually used inside the system. The application of a weight algorithm, however, may result in errors.A-weight: is the WFQ weight actually accepted by the system and directed to users. The system uses the reverse weight algorithm to convert the WFQ weight actually accepted by the system to a value that can be easily read by users. The purpose is to let users know that the WFQ weight used inside the system is different from the one configured by them."
