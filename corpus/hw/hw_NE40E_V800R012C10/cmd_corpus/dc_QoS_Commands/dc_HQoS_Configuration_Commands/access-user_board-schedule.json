    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nUser access: When TM-installed subcard is not in position, the downstream HQoS is disabled by default. HQoS configured by users will be forcibly converted to CAR to limit the rate. To implement HQoS in this case, run the access-user board-schedule enable outbound command to enable the downstream HQoS.\nPrecautions\nThe trunk whose member subcards are equipped with eTM boards of different types does not support the downstream HQoS function.The trunk whose member subcards are both eTM and non-eTM subcards does not support the downstream HQoS function.\n\nThe PAF file SPEC_FUNC_QOS_SUPPORT_BRAS_SQ applies only to the following boards equipped with non-eTM subcards: LPUF-240/LPUF-240-B/LPUF-240-E/LPUF-200-E/LPUI-240/LPUI-240-B/LPUI-240-L.\nThis command takes effect only on the following boards: CR57LPUF120A, CR57LPUF240A."
