    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThere are 8-CoS and 4-CoS priority modes. The 8-CoS priority mode is used by default. The 4-CoS priority mode allows you to implement rate limiting for eight flow queues by configuring rate limiting only for four flow queues, reducing the configuration workload. Before you configure a queue in 4-CoS flow queue mode, define the mappings between 8-CoS priorities and 4-CoS priorities. To configure a 4-CoS flow queue mapping profile in which the 8-CoS and 4-CoS mappings are defined, run the queue-4cos-mapping command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the profile specified in the queue-4cos-mapping command by parameter does not exist, the system creates a new queue-4cos-mapping profile.\nIf the profile specified by parameter exists, the queue-4cos-mapping profile view is displayed. You can modify the queue-4cos-mapping profile.\nPrecautions\nYou can configure a maximum of eight queue-4cos-mapping profiles in the system. A profile that is used by user-queue cannot be deleted."
