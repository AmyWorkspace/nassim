    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA flow queue profile in enhanced 8-CoS mode is used to configure scheduling parameters for eight priority queues. You can configure a scheduling priority, weight, CIR, PIR, and drop policy for the eight queues, scheduling service traffic with different priorities. To configure a drop policy in a flow queue profile in enhanced 8-CoS mode, run the flow-wred command.\nPrerequisites\nA drop policy profile has been created.\nPrecautions\nOnly LPUI-52/LPUF-53/LPUI-242/LPUF-243/LPUI-242-CM/LPUI-242-G/LPUI-402/LPUI-402-CM/LPUF-483/LPUI-2T-L/LPUI-2T-CM/LPUF-1T2 boards support a flow queue profile in enhanced 8-CoS mode."
