    "ExtraInfo": "The bandwidth configured for a user queue is a combination of a series of discrete bandwidths. Bandwidth granularity and quantity can be manually specified for each discrete bandwidth. A device usually uses the highest bandwidth precision method to match service bandwidths. That is, a relatively precise bandwidth combination is selected. However, this method cannot effectively ensure bandwidth quantity utilization. To resolve this issue, run the qos pir-precision user-queue precision command. After the command is run, the device uses the minimum bandwidth quantity method to match service bandwidths. That is, a relatively matching bandwidth granularity is selected to save bandwidth quantity. This method improves bandwidth precision while saving bandwidth quantity."
