    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe bandwidth of user queues comprise a serial of discrete bandwidths. You can configure the bandwidth granularity and quantity for each discrete bandwidth so that bandwidth can be reasonably allocated to services on the live network. To apply a channel profile to a board, run the qos channel-profile command.\nPrerequisites\nThe following operations have been performed:\nThe qos channel-profile command is run in the system view to create a channel profile.The channel bandwidth quantity command is run to configure the bandwidth granularity and quantity for each channel.\n\nPrecautions\nA channel profile with no parameter does not take effect.After a channel profile is applied to a slot, the parameters in the channel profile cannot be modified.A channel profile applied to a slot takes effect only after the board in the slot is restarted.\nIn VS mode, this command applies only to the admin VSand cannot be configured in other VSs. This command takes effect on all VSs."
