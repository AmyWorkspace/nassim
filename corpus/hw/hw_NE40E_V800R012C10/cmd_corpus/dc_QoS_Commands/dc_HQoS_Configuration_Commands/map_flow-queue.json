    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe map flow-queue command configures mapping from eight FQ priorities to eight CQ priorities (BE, AF1, AF2, AF3, AF4, EF, CS6, and CS7) to allow a service in FQ to enter the specific queue in a CQ.\nIf traffic of two user queues are output through one interface, 16 flows of the two users will aggregate to eight queues on a port. If the priority of user A is higher than that of user B, different flow mappings can be specified for users A and B respectively to allow traffic of user A to enter high-priority queues on the port. This ensures that services of users A and B are distinguished and scheduled differently.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf no data is configured with the map flow-queue command, the default setting is adopted, which means that the one-to-one mapping between the flow queue and class queue is adopted."
