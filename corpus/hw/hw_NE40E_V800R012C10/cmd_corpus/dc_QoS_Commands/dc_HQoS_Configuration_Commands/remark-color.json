    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can configure scheduling parameters for eight priority flow queues in a flow queue profile in enhanced 8-CoS mode. To enable the re-marking function for a flow queue with specified priorities, run this command. After the command is run, the system differentiates and re-marks PIR and CIR traffic.\nPrerequisites\nA flow queue profile in enhanced 8-CoS mode has been configured.\nPrecautions\nThe re-marking function takes effect only for upstream traffic.\nOnly LPUI-52/LPUF-53/LPUI-242/LPUF-243/LPUI-242-CM/LPUI-242-G/LPUI-402/LPUI-402-CM/LPUF-483/LPUI-2T-L/LPUI-2T-CM/LPUF-1T2 boards support a flow queue profile in enhanced 8-CoS mode."
