By default, no resource size is configured for user queues in 4-queue or enhanced 8-CoS mode.\nBefore configuring functions related to user queues in 4-queue or enhanced 8-CoS mode, run this command to configure a resource size for these user queues.\nPrecautions\nOnly LPUF-240s and LPUF-480s support the 4-CoS mode.\nOnly LPUI-52/LPUF-53/LPUI-242/LPUF-243/LPUI-242-CM/LPUI-242-G/LPUI-402/LPUI-402-CM/LPUF-483/LPUI-2T-L/LPUI-2T-CM/LPUF-1T2 boards support user queues in enhanced 8-CoS mode."
