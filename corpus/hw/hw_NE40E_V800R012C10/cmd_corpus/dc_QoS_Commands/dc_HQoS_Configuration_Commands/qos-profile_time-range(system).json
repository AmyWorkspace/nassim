    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo create a time range-based QoS profile, run the qos-profile time-range command. You can configure multiple time range-based user queues in the QoS profile and set scheduling parameters, including the CIR, PIR, FQ profile, CAR, and Layer 2 suppression parameters, for the user queues. A QoS profile takes effect on an interface after being applied to the interface.\nPrecautions\nYou can configure a maximum of 4095 QoS profiles in the system. The QoS profile that has been applied to an interface cannot be deleted.\nA QoS profile with time-range supports multiple user queues with time-range. Different user queues take effect based on the time range. Only one user queue without time-range can be configured and takes effect at any time. Within the same time range, the user queue configuration with time-range takes precedence over the user-queue configuration without time-range."
