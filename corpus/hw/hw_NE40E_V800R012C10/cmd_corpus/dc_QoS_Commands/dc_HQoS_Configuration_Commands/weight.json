    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the case of traffic congestion, the weight command can be used to set weight values for SQs so that the SQs can be scheduled based on the weights.\nThe scheduling algorithm for SQs is CIR + (weight/SUM weight) x (GQ Shaping - SUM CIR).\nWFQ is implemented for SQs under the condition that the CIRs are guaranteed.\nIf the available bandwidth of a user calculated using the algorithm is larger than the PIR value, the PIR value takes effect, and the remaining bandwidth is allocated to other users based on the weight values.\nPrecautions\nIn a QoS profile, the direction-oriented weight and directionless weight cannot be configured at the same time."
