    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA user queue profile is used to configure parameters such as a scheduling mode, scheduling priority, scheduling weight, and shaping value for a user queue scheduler. This profile can be referenced by different QoS profiles so that different user queue schedulers perform differentiated QoS processing for service traffic. This improves HQoS configuration efficiency.\nYou must create a user queue profile before configuring parameters for it.\nPrecautions\nCurrently, a user queue profile can be bound only to a QoS profile in enhanced 8-CoS mode."
