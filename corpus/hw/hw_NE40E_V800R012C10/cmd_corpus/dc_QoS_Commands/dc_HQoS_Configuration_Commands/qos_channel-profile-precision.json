    "ExtraInfo": "To configure the bandwidth allocation mode, run the qos channel-profile-precision command. This command applies to all the banknote bandwidth requests on the board. The banknote bandwidths indicate the bandwidths of discrete channels. The sum of channels' bandwidths must meet the requirements on the total channel bandwidth.\nGenerally, the total channel bandwidth is fixed, and the bandwidths requested by channels are different. The sum of bandwidths requested by channels may fail to meet the requirements on the total channel bandwidth. To resolve this problem, run the qos channel-profile-precision command to set the bandwidth allocation mode to downward to decrease the rate limit or set the bandwidth allocation mode to upward to increase the rate limit. This optimizes bandwidth resource utilization."
