    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a user queue profile, you can configure scheduling parameters such as scheduling modes, scheduling priorities, scheduling weights, and shaping values for four user queue schedulers, so that the user queue schedulers can process traffic differently.\nTo change the scheduling mode of a user queue scheduler with a specified priority, run this command. If no scheduling mode is set, the default scheduling mode is used to schedule traffic."
