    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn WFQ scheduling mode, a parent scheduler schedules traffic in user queues based on scheduling weights. If traffic congestion occurs, the scheduler schedules the service traffic of users based on the weight ratio between user queues. In the user queue profile view, you can run this command to set a scheduling weight for a specified parent scheduler. If no scheduling weight is set, the parent scheduler schedules traffic based on the default weight.\nPrecautions\nA scheduling weight takes effect only when the scheduling mode of a parent scheduler is WFQ."
