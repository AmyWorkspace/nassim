    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe flow mapping object defines the mapping from the CoS of flows in the subscriber queue to the CoS for the flow to go into the class queue.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the specified mapping- name does not exist, the system creates a new flow mapping object.\nIf the specified mapping- name exists, the system enters the flow mapping view, under which you can modify the flow mapping.\nPrecautions\nThere are a maximum of 16 flow flow mapping objects in one system. One object the default one, and the other 15 objects can be created by users.\nThere are a maximum of 32 flow flow mapping objects can be configured in all systems.\nThe flow mapping objects that are applied by user-queue cannot be deleted.\nThis command is supported only on the following boards and takes effect only when the board is not equipped with an eTM subcard: CR53LPUF50A, CR57LPU50B, CR57LPUF50C, CR57LPUF100C, CR57LPUF120A, CR57LPUF240A, CR57LPUF240F."
