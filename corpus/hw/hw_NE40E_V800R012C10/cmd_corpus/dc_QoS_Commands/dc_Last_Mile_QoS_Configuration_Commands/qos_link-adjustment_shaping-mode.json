    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device can implement the link-level QoS on two types of links. It selects the mode of the link-level QoS according to the type of the links on the two ends of the DSLAM.If users are accessed through PPPoE, the mode of the link-level QoS should be configured to frame.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nIf this command is configured in the AAA domain view, the command is effective with L2TP services only. If this command is configured in both the interface view and the AAA domain view, the command configured in the AAA domain view takes effect.\nIn scenarios where an LNS functions as the tunnel ingress, the LPUF-480 does not support last-mile QoS in cell mode."
