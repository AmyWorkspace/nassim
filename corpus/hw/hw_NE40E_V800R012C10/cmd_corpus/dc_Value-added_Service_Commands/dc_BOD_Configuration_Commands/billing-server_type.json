    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe billing-server type command is used to configure the system to control whether a user in the domain is allowed to switch to the value-added service policy template dynamically. By default, the user is allowed to switch to the value-added service policy template dynamically. After the template is switched, the user sends a stop-accounting packet and a start-accounting packet. When the normal policy switch mode is configured, the user obtains the QoS parameters of the new template, updates the configuration, and then sends a real-time accounting packet.\nConfiguration Impact\nIn dynamic policy switch mode, the user is not charged with the tariff level after the policy server releases a new template and a new accounting service is generated.In normal policy switch mode, the policy server releases a new template and the user can only obtain the QoS parameters in it. After the bandwidth restriction is updated, the system sends a real-time accounting packet.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
