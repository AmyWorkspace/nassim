    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen EDSG service traffic includes packets of multiple service classes, to allow a device to implement queue scheduling based on the service class of the original packets, run the service-class edsg keep-queue-level command. After the EDSG service is matched to a traffic behavior, the service class of the EDSG service does not override that of the original packets. Instead, the service class of the original packets is retained.\nPrerequisites\nA traffic behavior has been configured, and the traffic behavior view is displayed.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThis command applies only to the UCL.This command is mutually exclusive to the following commands in the traffic behavior view:cardns-redirecthttp-redirectdenyredirect-cpu http-redirect-chastenredirect-cpu portalservice-classtariff-leveltraffic-statistic"
