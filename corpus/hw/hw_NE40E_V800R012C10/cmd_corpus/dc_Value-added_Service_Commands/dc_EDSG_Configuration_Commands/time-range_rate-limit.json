    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure the EDSG service bandwidth to be flexibly adjusted when the time range changes, run the time-range rate-limit command in the EDSG service policy view.\nPrerequisites\nA time range has been defined using the time-range command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the time-range rate-limit command is run, the EDSG service bandwidth is adjusted when the time range changes.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nAn EDSG service policy allows a maximum of three mappings to be configured between the time range template and service bandwidth.\nIf multiple time range templates are configured for an EDSG service policy, overlapping time ranges may exist between time range templates. In this situation, the EDSG service bandwidth preferentially matches the first configured time range template."
