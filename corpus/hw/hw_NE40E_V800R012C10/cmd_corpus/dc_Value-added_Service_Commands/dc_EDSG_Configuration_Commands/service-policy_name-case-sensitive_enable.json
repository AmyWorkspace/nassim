    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, after receiving an EDSG service policy name from a RADIUS server through RADIUS authentication packets, the BARS device converts uppercase letters in the name into lowercase letters. If the RADIUS server is sensitive to EDSG service policy names, policy names may become inconsistent between the server and BRAS. To resolve this issue, run the service-policy name-case-sensitive enable command to enable case sensitivity for EDSG service policies.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nBefore the undo service-policy name-case-sensitive enable command is run, delete service policies whose names contain uppercase letters."
