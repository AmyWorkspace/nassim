    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the device uses the outer IPv6 header in each IPv4 in IPv6 packet to match EDSG services. If the inner IPv4 address needs to be used to match EDSG services, run the value-added-service edsg centralized-ds-lite command so that rate limit and accounting are implemented for EDSG services based on the inner IPv4 address.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
