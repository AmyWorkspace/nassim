    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCarriers can carry out prepaid services for the upstream traffic, downstream traffic, or both upstream and downstream traffic. To specify the traffic direction to which the EDSG service quota applies, run the service volume-quota apply command.\nImplementation Procedure\nIf the service volume-quota apply command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one. Therefore, this command configuration takes effect for subsequent login users.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter this command is run, if the EDSG service quota is reduced, the reduced quota applies to the specified traffic direction but not to both upstream and downstream directions.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
