    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe quota-out means when the local quotas are used out, the device sends an application for more quotas but the server denies to allocate quotas to it. There're two types of the quota-out policies. HTTP-redirection, and deactivating the service.\nPrerequisites\nWhen the quota-out policy is redirection, the referred HTTP redirection template should have been configured already.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the policy is HTTP-redirection, the HTTP application of the service will be redirected to a certain page.\nWhen the policy is deactivating the service, the service will be deleted. The traffic of this service will be matched with other services or users.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
