    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn dual-stack scenarios, the IPv4 and IPv6 traffic statistics of the EDSG service are uniformly collected. If IPv4 and IPv6 traffic statistics need to be collected separately, two EDSG servcies can planned, one for IPv4 traffic and the other for IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic statistics are collected in default mode, and IPv6 traffic statistics are collected based on an EDSG service template configured using the ip-type ipv6 command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ip-type ipv6 command is run, statistics about IPv6 traffic is collected for EDSG services.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nIf this command is not configured, the collected traffic statistics are still IPv4 traffic statistics even when the EDSG service has been planned to match IPv6 traffic."
