    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen CAR rate limit is performed for DAA services and SQs are configured to limit user rates, statistics based on count IDs are not performed for traffic after CAR rate limit if the traffic-separate enable command is run to configure DAA service separation. In this situation, separate traffic statistics are performed for dual-stack DAA users. As a result, user service traffic cannot be counted into DAA service traffic. To perform separate traffic statistics for dual-stack DAA users based on user queues, run the user accounting dual-stack separate user-queue command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
