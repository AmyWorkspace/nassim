    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a uniform accounting scenario, if the HW-Policy-Name (26-95) attribute name that the RADIUS server uses a CoA message to deliver is the same as the DAA service policy name in a domain, the device replies with an NAK message. To enable the device to reply with an ACK message in this scenario, run the radius-server coa-request hw-policy-name daa same-policy reply-ack command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
