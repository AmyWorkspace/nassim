To allow access control between users in an enterprise, run the traffic-policy command to apply a traffic policy to a BAS interface for each user. When Layer 2 or Layer 3 leased line users are not authenticated, applying a traffic policy to a BAS interface is also required to allow access control between Layer 2 or Layer 3 leased line users.\nPrerequisites\nA traffic policy has been created.The BAS interface has been configured as a Layer 2 or Layer 3 leased line interface.\n\nPrecautions\nThis command is mutually exclusive with the match-type vxlan-qos-local-id enable command."
