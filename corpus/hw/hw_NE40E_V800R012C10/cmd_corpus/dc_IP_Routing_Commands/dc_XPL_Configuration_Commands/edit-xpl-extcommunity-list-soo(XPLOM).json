    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn SoO set is a group of data related to the SoO extended community attribute and can be used by route-filters to filter VPN routes. To enter the SoO set paragraph editing interface view, run the edit xpl extcommunity-list soo command.\nTo configure an SoO set in the SoO set paragraph editing interface view, perform the following steps: Configure a start clause (xpl extcommunity-list soo soo-list-name) for an SoO set. Configure elements for the set and separate every two neighboring elements with a comma (,). The elements can be configured in any of the following formats:2-byte AS number:4-byte user-defined number, for example, 1:3. The AS number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535, and the user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 4294967295.IPv4 address:2-byte user-defined number, for example, 192.168.122.15:1. The IPv4 address ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, and the user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535.Integral 4-byte AS number:2-byte user-defined number, for example, 0:3 or 65537:3. The integral 4-byte AS number ranges from 65536 to 4294967295, and the user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535.4-byte AS number in dotted notation (x.y):2-byte user-defined number, for example, 0.0:3 or 0.1:0. The x, y, and user-defined number are integers ranging from 0 to 65535.In the preceding elements, either value around a colon (:) can be replaced by an asterisk (*) to match any value.\nregular regular-expression: matches VPN routes with SoO in the specified regular expression. For detailed description about regular expressions, see Configuration Guide - Basic Configuration.Regular expression processing is computing-intensive. When a large number of regular expressions are configured in an XPL policy to match a BGP route attribute and the length of the route attribute is long, the processing performance of the XPL policy deteriorates. To improve the processing performance of the routing policy, decrease the number of regular expressions or use a non-regular expression matching command.\nIt is recommended that a maximum of 100 regular expressions be configured for each policy.\n\n Configuration. Configure an end clause (end-list) for the SoO set.\n\n\nPrecautions\nAn SoO set is only a group of data used as matching rules and does not have the permit or deny function. Therefore, an SoO set can be used to filter routes only after it is referenced by a route-filter.\nIf the SoO attribute is set to be in the format of 4-byte AS number:2-byte user-defined number, the filtering rule that uses the SoO-based regular expression is affected by the as-notation plain command:\nIf the as-notation plain command is run, route matching can succeed only after the regular expression is set to be in the format of integral 4-byte AS number:2-byte user-defined number.If the as-notation plain command is not run, route matching can succeed only after the regular expression is set to be in the format of 4-byte AS number in dotted notation:2-byte user-defined number.If the as-notation plain command is run after the regular expression is configured, you need to reconfigure the RD value using the rdStr parameter; otherwise, route matching may fail against an import or export route-policy, causing a network fault."
