    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA Large-Community set is a group of data related to the Large-Community attribute and can be used by route-filters to filter BGP routes. To create a Large-Community set and enter the Large-Community set view, run the xpl large-community-list command.\nFollow-up Procedure\n In the Large-Community set view, configure elements in the format of aa:bb:cc (1:1:1 for example) for the Large-Community set and separate every two neighboring elements with a comma (,). An asterisk (*) can be used in an element to represent any digit; for example, an element can be set to 10:10:*. Alternatively, configure elements in the format of regular regular-expression, which matches routes with the large-community attribute in the specified regular expression. For detailed description about regular expressions, see Configuration Guide - Basic Configuration.Regular expression processing is computing-intensive. When a large number of regular expressions are configured in an XPL policy to match a BGP route attribute and the length of the route attribute is long, the processing performance of the XPL policy deteriorates. To improve the processing performance of the routing policy, decrease the number of regular expressions or use a non-regular expression matching command.\nIt is recommended that a maximum of 100 regular expressions be configured for each policy.\n In the Large-Community set view, run the end-list command to configure an end clause for the Large-Community set.\n\nPrecautions\nA Large-Community set is only a group of data used as matching rules and does not have the permit or deny function. Therefore, a Large-Community set can be used to filter routes only after it is referenced by a route-filter.\nTo exit the Large-Community set view, run the abort command in the Large-Community set view."
