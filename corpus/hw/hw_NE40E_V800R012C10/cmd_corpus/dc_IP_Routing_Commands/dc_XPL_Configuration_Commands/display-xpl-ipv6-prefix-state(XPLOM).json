If a large amount of information is output, you can specify attached or unattached to filter the information. Route attribute set reference indicates that a route attribute set is referenced by a route-filter, and route-filter reference indicates that a route-filter is referenced by a routing protocol. To check the configuration and reference information about XPL IPv6 prefix sets, run the display xpl ipv6-prefix-list command."
