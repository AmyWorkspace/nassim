    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn IPv6 prefix set is a group of IPv6 prefix data used by a route-filter to filter BGP routes based on route attributes, such as the source, destination, or next hop IP address. To enter the IPv6 prefix set paragraph editing interface view, run the edit xpl ipv6-prefix-list command.\nTo configure an IPv6 prefix set in the IPv6 prefix set paragraph editing interface view, perform the following steps:\n Configure a start clause (xpl ipv6-prefix-list ipv6-prefix-list-name) for an IPv6 prefix set. Configure elements (IPv6 addresses with masks, 2001:db8:0:1:: 64 for example) for the set and separate every two neighboring elements with a comma (,). You can use eq, ge, or le to specify the mask length. For example, 2001:db8:0:1:: 64 ge 96 le 100 matches the routes in network segment 2001:db8:0:1::/64 with the mask length ranging from 96 to 100 bits. Configure an end clause (end-list) for the IPv6 prefix set.\n\nPrecautions\nAn IPv6 prefix set is only a group of data used as matching rules and does not have the permit or deny function. Therefore, an IPv6 prefix set can be used to filter routes only after it is referenced by a route-filter."
