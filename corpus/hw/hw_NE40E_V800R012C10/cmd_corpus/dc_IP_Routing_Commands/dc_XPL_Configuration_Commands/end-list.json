    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRoute-filters are used to filter routes based on sets or a single element. To conclude the configuration of a set, exit the set view, and return to the system view, run the end-list command.\nPrerequisites\nA name and elements have been configured for a set.\nPrecautions\nA set is only a group of data used as matching rules and does not have the permit or deny function. Therefore, a set can be used to filter routes only after it is referenced by a route-filter."
