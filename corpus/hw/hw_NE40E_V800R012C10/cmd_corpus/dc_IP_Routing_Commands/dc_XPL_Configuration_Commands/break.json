    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRoute-filters are used to filter routes based on sets or a single element and modify route attributes of the routes that meet matching rules. If the break command is run, the device exits from the current route-filter. If the current route-filter is referenced by a parent route-filter, the device keeps implementing remaining condition and action clauses of the parent route-filter.\nPrecautions\nThe break command itself does not have a permit or deny attribute. However, if none of the apply, approve, refuse, or finish command has been run when the break command is run, the device exits from the current route-filter and denies the routes that match the filtering conditions of the specified route-filter.\nIn the following example, routes are denied.\nxpl route-filter r1break\nend-filter\nIn the following example, routes are permitted.\nxpl route-filter r1approve\nbreak\nend-filter"
