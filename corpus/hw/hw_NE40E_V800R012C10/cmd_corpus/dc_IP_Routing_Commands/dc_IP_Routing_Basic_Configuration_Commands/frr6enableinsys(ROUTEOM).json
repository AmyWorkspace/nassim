    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen there are public network routes generated by multiple types of routing protocols on a device, the ipv6 frr command can be used to enable IPv6 FRR to immediately switch traffic among routes and ensure uninterrupted traffic forwarding if certain routes are faulty.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the ipv6 frr command is not run, the system only selects a group of optimal protocol routes as active routes. After the ipv6 frr command is run, the system selects a group of sub-optimal protocol routes as the backup of related active routes.\nPrecautions\nA routing loop may occur after the ipv6 frr command is run because the command is used to enable routes generated by different routing protocols to back up each other. Therefore, exercise caution when running the command."
