    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen there are public network routes generated by multiple types of routing protocols on a device, you can run the ip frr command to enable IP FRR to immediately switch traffic among routes and ensure uninterrupted traffic forwarding if certain routes are faulty. The following example shows how IP FRR works:\nThere are two routes to 1.1.1.1 on a device. One is an OSPF route with priority 15, and the other one is a static route with priority 60. When IP FRR is not enabled, the OSPF route is preferred. After IP FRR is enabled, the OSPF route functions as the primary route, and the static route functions as the backup route. If the OSPF route fails, the system immediately switches traffic to the static route to ensure uninterrupted traffic forwarding.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ip frr command is run, the system automatically selects the inactive route as the backup of the active route.\nPrecautions\nA routing loop may occur after the ip frr command is run because the command is used to enable routes generated by different routing protocols to back up each other. Therefore, exercise caution when running the command."
