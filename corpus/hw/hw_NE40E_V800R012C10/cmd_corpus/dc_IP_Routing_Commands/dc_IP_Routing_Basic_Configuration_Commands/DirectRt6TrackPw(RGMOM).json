    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo adjust the cost of the IPv6 direct route on an interface based on the PW status, run the direct-route ipv6 track pw-state command. When the PW status is backup, the cost of the IPv6 direct route is changed to the configured; when the PW status is active, the cost of the IPv6 direct route is changed to default value 0. For configurations details, see Configuration-IP Routing Basis Configuration-Configuring an IPv6 Direct Route to Respond to L3VE Interface Status Changes After a Delay.\nPrecautions\nThe direct-route ipv6 track pw-state and direct-route ipv6 degrade-delay commands are mutually exclusive. If both them are run on one L3VE interface, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
