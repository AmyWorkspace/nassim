    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the Router imports a large number of routes, system performance may be affected when processing services because the routes consume excessive system resources. To improve system security and reliability, run the ip prefix-limit command to configure a limit on the number of IPv4 public route prefixes. When the number of IPv4 public route prefixes exceeds the limit, an alarm is generated, prompting you to check whether unneeded IPv4 public route prefixes exist.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ip prefix-limit command is run, the Router may discard unneeded IPv4 public route prefixes.\nIf the number of IPv4 public route prefixes exceeds the value calculated from number x alert-percent/100, an alarm (L3VPN_1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.11.0.3 mplsL3VpnVrfRouteMidThreshExceeded) is generated.If the number of IPv4 public route prefixes exceeds number, an alarm (L3VPN_1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.11.0.4 mplsL3VpnVrfNumVrfRouteMaxThreshExceeded) is generated.If the number of IPv4 public route prefixes falls below the value calculated from number x alert-percent/100, a clear alarm (L3VPN_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.177.1.3.8 hwL3vpnVrfRouteMidThreshCleared) is generated.If the number of IPv4 public route prefixes exceeds number, a clear alarm (L3VPN_1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.11.0.6 mplsL3VpnNumVrfRouteMaxThreshCleared) is generated.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the ip prefix-limit command is run more than once, the last configuration overrides the previous one.\nAfter the number of IPv4 public route prefixes exceeds the limit, note the following rules:\nIf you run the ip prefix-limit command to increase or the undo ip prefix-limit command to delete the limit, the Router relearns IPv4 public route prefixes.Direct and static routes can still be added to the IP routing table."
