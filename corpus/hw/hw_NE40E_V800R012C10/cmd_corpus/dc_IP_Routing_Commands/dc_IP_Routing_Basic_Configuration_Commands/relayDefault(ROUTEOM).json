    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe next hops of unicast static routes or multicast static routes may not be directly reachable. In this case, recursion is required so that such routes can be used for traffic forwarding. To allow the IPv4 unicast static routes or multicast static routes whose next hops are not directly reachable to recurse to the default route, run the ip route recursive-lookup default-route protocol command.\nPrecautions\nAfter the ip route recursive-lookup default-route protocol command is run, IPv4 routes of the specified type can recurse to the default route, which may lead to a forwarding path change."
