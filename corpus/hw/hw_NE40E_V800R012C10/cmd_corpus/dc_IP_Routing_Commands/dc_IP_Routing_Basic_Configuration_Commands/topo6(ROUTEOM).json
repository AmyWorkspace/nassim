    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMulti-topology is usually applied to multicast. The RPF check depends on the unicast routing table. If multicast uses the default unicast routing table, two problems occur:\nUnicast route changes affect the establishment of a multicast distribution tree because multicast highly depends on unicast.Multicast cannot plan a multicast distribution tree, independent of unicast.\nTherefore, besides the default unicast topology, a multicast topology needs to be planned for multicast.\n\nPrerequisites\nIPv6 has been enabled globally.\nConfiguration Impact\nProtocols can use a topology only after logical topologies are planned on the basis of a physical topology.\nPrecautions\nThe topology named base is a base topology and can neither be configured nor deleted.\nRunning the undo ipv6 topology command deletes all service configurations of the specified topology instance along with the topology instance. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command."
