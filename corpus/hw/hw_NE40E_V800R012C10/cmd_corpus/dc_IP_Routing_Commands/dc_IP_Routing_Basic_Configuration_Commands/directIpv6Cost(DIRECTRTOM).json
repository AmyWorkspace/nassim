    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the direct-route ipv6 cost command is run on an L3VE sub-interface, the cost of routes to the directly connected network segment on the L3VE sub-interface becomes the configured value. For configurations details, see Configuration-IP Routing Basis Configuration-Configuring AGGs to Load-Balance RNC-to-CSG Traffic.\nPrecautions\nBoth the direct-route ipv6 cost and direct-route ipv6 track pw-state, direct-route ipv6 track vrrp6, or direct-route ipv6 degrade-delay commands can be run.\nIf both the direct-route ipv6 cost and direct-route ipv6 track pw-state commands are run, the cost of routes to the directly connected network segment is calculated according to the following rules:If the PW is active, the cost is the value configured using the direct-route ipv6 cost command.If the PW is standby or Down, the cost is the value configured using the direct-route ipv6 cost command plus that configured using the direct-route ipv6 track pw-state command. If the calculated cost is greater than the maximum value (4294967295), 4294967295 takes effect.\nIf both the direct-route ipv6 cost and direct-route ipv6 track vrrp6 commands are run, the cost of routes to the directly connected network segment is calculated according to the following rules:If the device is the master of the VRRP backup group, the cost is the value configured using the direct-route ipv6 cost command.If the device is a backup device of the VRRP backup group, the cost is the value configured using the direct-route ipv6 cost command plus that configured using the direct-route ipv6 track vrrp6 command. If the calculated cost is greater than the maximum value (4294967295), 4294967295 takes effect.\nIf both the direct-route ipv6 cost and direct-route ipv6 degrade-delay commands are run and the L3VE sub-interface goes from Down to Up, the cost of routes to the directly connected network segment is calculated according to the following rules:After the delay expires, the cost is the value configured using the direct-route ipv6 cost command.Before the delay expires, the cost is the value configured using the direct-route ipv6 cost command plus that configured using the direct-route ipv6 degrade-delay command. If the calculated cost is greater than the maximum value (4294967295), 4294967295 takes effect."
