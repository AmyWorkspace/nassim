    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFor example, there are two routes to 1.1.1.1. One is a BGP route with priority 150, and the other one is a static route with priority 60. When IP FRR is not enabled, the static route is preferred. After IP FRR is enabled, the static route functions as the primary route, and the BGP route functions as the backup route. If the static route fails, the system immediately switches traffic to the BGP route to ensure uninterrupted traffic forwarding.\nPrerequisites\nThe VPN instance has been created.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ip frr command is run, the system automatically selects an inactive route as the backup of an active route.\nPrecautions\nA routing loop may occur after the ip frr command is run because the command is used to enable routes generated by different routing protocols to back up each other. Therefore, exercise caution when running the command."
