    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe next hops of IPv6 static routes may not be directly reachable. In this case, recursion is required so that such routes can be used for traffic forwarding. To allow the IPv6 static routes whose next hops are not directly reachable to recurse to the default route, run the ipv6 route recursive-lookup default-route protocol static command.\nPrecautions\nAfter the ipv6 route recursive-lookup default-route protocol static command is run, IPv6 static routes of the specified type can recurse to the default route, which may lead to a forwarding path change."
