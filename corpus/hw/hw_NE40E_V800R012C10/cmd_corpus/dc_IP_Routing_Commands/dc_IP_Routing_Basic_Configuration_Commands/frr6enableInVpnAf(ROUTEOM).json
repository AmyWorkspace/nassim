    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen there are private network routes generated by multiple types of routing protocols in a VPN instance enabled with the IPv6 address family, the ipv6 frr command can be used to enable IPv6 FRR to immediately switch traffic among routes and ensure uninterrupted traffic forwarding if certain routes are faulty.\nPrerequisites\nThe VPN instance has been created, and the IPv6 address family has been enabled in the VPN instance.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ipv6 frr command is run, the system automatically selects an inactive route as the backup of an active route.\nPrecautions\nA routing loop may occur after the ipv6 frr command is run because the command is used to enable routes generated by different routing protocols to back up each other. Therefore, exercise caution when running the command."
