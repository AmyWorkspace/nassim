    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA route monitoring group can be associated with service modules only after the monitor enable command is run for the group.\nWhen a large number of routes keep being added to or deleted from a route monitoring group, the down-weight sum of the route monitoring group may change frequently, which in turn leads to service flapping of the service modules associated with the route monitoring group. To prevent such service flapping, run the undo monitor enable command to disable the route monitoring group so that it is dissociated from all service modules. After the routes are added or deleted, run the monitor enable command to re-associate the route monitoring group with all service modules.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the monitor enable command is run, the route monitoring group takes effect immediately. If you keep adding routes to or deleting routes from the route monitoring group, the down-weight sum of the route monitoring group may change frequently, which in turn leads to service flapping of the service modules associated with the route monitoring group."
