    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe BGP-LS domain AS numbers of devices must be the same so that the controller calculates routes based on the combined topology information reported by the devices. To configure a BGP-LS domain AS number, run the domain as command. By default, a BGP AS number is used as the BGP-LS domain AS number. Two devices with different BGP AS numbers must have the same BGP-LS domain AS number configured using the domain as command so that the controller can obtain combined topology information about the two ASs for route calculation."
