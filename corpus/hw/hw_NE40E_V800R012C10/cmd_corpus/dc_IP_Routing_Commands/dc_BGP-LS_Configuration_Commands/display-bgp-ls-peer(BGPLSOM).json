The command output shows the following information:\nBGP-LS peer connection statusBGP-LS peer configurationsWhether BGP-LS peers are successfully configuredWhether BGP-LS peers are successfully deleted\nTo check information about slow BGP peers, run the display bgp link-state unicast slow-peer command. The information includes the time when a peer began to be identified as a slow peer, the time when a peer last exited from the slow peer state, the number of times a peer has been identified as a slow peer, and the remaining time for a peer to exit from the slow peer state."
