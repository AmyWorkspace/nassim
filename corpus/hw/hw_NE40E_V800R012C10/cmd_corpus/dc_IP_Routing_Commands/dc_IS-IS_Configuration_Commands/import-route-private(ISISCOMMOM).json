Therefore, avoid the loops caused by manual configurations when configuring IS-IS to import external routes.\nAfter you configure the policy for importing routes using the route-policy parameters, the IS-IS process imports only the routes of the network segments that match the requirements to filter unwanted routes.\nPrecautions\nThe import-route (IS-IS) command cannot import the default route of an external protocol. To enable a router to advertise the default route of an external protocol it learns when updating the IS-IS routing table to other routers within the area, run the default-route-advertise (IS-IS) command.\nA segment routing-capable device can import IS-IS routes. If labels have been assigned to these routes, the labels are imported to a local process by default and advertised using LSPs, regardless of whether the labels are active.\nA segment routing-capable device can import labeled OSPF routes into the IS-IS routing table and use the routes to compute SR LSPs."
