    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nVirtual cluster access uses extended IS-IS to collect network topology information. A virtual cluster access IS-IS process can be automatically or manually established.\nManual establishment: To plan IS-IS processes, perform the following operations:Run the isis command to create an IS-IS process.Run the virtual-cluster-access enable command to configure the process as a virtual cluster access IS-IS process.Run the virtual-cluster-access command to enable virtual cluster access.Automatic establishment: After you globally enable virtual cluster access on a device, the device checks whether a virtual cluster access IS-IS process exists. If a virtual cluster access IS-IS process exists, the device enables only virtual cluster access. If a virtual cluster access IS-IS process does not exist, the device automatically establishes a virtual cluster access IS-IS process based on the rules.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created using the isis command."
