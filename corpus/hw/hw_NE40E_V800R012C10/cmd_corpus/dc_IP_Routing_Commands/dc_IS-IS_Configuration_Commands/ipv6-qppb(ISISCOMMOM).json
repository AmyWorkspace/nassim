    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, IS-IS IPv6 routes do not carry QoS attributes. Therefore, IS-IS IPv6 routes do not support traffic statistics collection. If you need to collect statistics of traffic along IS-IS IPv6 routes, run the ipv6 qppb command.\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created using the isis command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ipv6 qppb command is run, IS-IS IPv6 routes carry QoS attributes. The RM module obtains the QoS attributes upon receiving IS-IS IPv6 routes and then collects traffic statistics."
