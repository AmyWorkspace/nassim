    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, on Huawei devices, the type-132 TLV in LSPs carries the IP addresses of all IS-IS interfaces. However, on some non-Huawei devices, the type-132 TLV in LSPs carries the IP address of only one IS-IS interface. To implement interworking between Huawei devices and these non-Huawei devices, run the advertise one-interface-address command on the Huawei devices to enable the type-132 TLV in LSPs to carry the IP address of only one IS-IS interface.\nAfter the command is run, the interface IP address carried in the type-132 TLV in LSPs is selected as follows:\nA loopback interface's IP address is preferentially selected.If multiple loopback interfaces exist, the highest IP address of these interfaces is preferred. If no loopback interface exists, the highest IP address of other interfaces is selected.\n\nPrecautions\nIf a Huawei device fails to interwork with a non-Huawei device before this command is run, the interworking succeeds only after the command is run on the Huawei device and the IS-IS process on the non-Huawei device is restarted to trigger path recalculation."
