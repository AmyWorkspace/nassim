    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf IS-IS interfaces frequently alternate between up and down, the interfaces will flap, and protocol packets will be frequently exchanged, affecting IS-IS services. To address this issue, run the undo isis suppress-flapping interface disable command to enable interface flapping suppression. This function allows a device to delay interface state changes to up.\nBy default, interface flapping suppression is enabled globally for all IS-IS interfaces. If this function is not needed, run the isis suppress-flapping interface disable command to disable it."
