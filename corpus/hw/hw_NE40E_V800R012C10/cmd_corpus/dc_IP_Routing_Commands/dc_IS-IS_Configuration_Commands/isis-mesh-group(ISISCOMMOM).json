    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an interface that does not belong to an IS-IS mesh-group receives an LSP, the interface sends the LSP to all the other interfaces. On an NBMA network with multiple connections and P2P links, the same LSP will flood the network and consume bandwidth.\nTo address this problem, run the isis mesh-group command to add an interface to a mesh-group. Then, the interface sends the received LSP only to interfaces that do not belong to its mesh-group.\nPrerequisites\nIS-IS has been enabled on an interface using the isis enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf all interfaces on a router are blocked, no packet can be sent, causing a database synchronization problem.\nPrecautions\nWhen adding interfaces to mesh-groups or blocking interfaces, do not run the isis mesh-group command on all interfaces. This can prevent link faults from affecting the normal spreading of LSPs."
