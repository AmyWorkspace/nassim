    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWith ECMP FRR, IS-IS pre-calculates backup paths for load balancing links based on the LSDBs on the entire network. The backup paths are stored in the forwarding table and are used for traffic protection in the case of link failures. If the network topology changes, ECMP FRR triggers calculation of new backup paths, which increases the system calculation pressure. In addition, the backup entries generated by the ECMP FRR function increase the memory usage of the system. In this case, you can run the ecmp disable command to disable the ECMP FRR function.\nPrecautions\nThe solutions of selecting a backup path for IS-IS ECMP FRR are node-and-link protection path first and smallest-cost path first in order of preference."
