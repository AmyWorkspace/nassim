    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen generating the system LSP, a Router fills in the maximum Keepalive time for this LSP. When other Routers receive this LSP, the Keepalive time of the LSP is reduced continuously. If a Router does not receive the update LSP, the Keepalive time of the LSP is reduced to 0, the LSP is kept for 60 seconds. If a new LSP is not received in 60 seconds, the Router deletes the LSP.\nThe timer lsp-max-age command can adjust the maximum Keepalive time of an LSP to ensure the validity of old LSPs before the refreshed LSPs are received.\nPrerequisites\nBefore running the timer lsp-max-age command, run the isis command to create an IS-IS process.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the maximum Keepalive time of an LSP is configured too short, the LSP may be lost.\nPrecautions\nThe maximum Keepalive time of an LSP must be longer than the LSP refresh interval configured by timer lsp-refresh. Otherwise, the LSP cannot be updated before being deleted."
