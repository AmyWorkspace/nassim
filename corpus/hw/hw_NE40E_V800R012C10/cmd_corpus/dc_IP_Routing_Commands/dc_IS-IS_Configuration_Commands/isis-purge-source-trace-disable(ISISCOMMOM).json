    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf network-wide IS-IS LSPs are deleted, purge LSPs are flooded, which adversely affects network stability. In this case, source tracing must be implemented to locate the root cause of the fault immediately to minimize the impact. However, IS-IS itself does not support source tracing. A conventional solution is isolation node by node until the faulty node is located, but the solution is complex and time-consuming. To address this problem, enable IS-IS purge LSP source tracing.\nPrecautions\nAfter the command is run, IS-IS purge LSP source tracing is disabled globally, and source tracing information is no longer recorded."
