    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a broadcast network, a DIS sends CSNPs periodically to enable all devices to synchronize LSDBs with one another. If a device finds that the local LSDB does not have a specific LSP or an existing LSP is not the latest one after the device has received a CSNP, the device will send a PSNP to request the corresponding LSP.\nThe interval at which CSNPs are sent can be configured using the isis timer csnp command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe IS-IS route convergence speed depends on the LSDB synchronization speed. Therefore, reducing the interval at which CSNPs are sent can speed up LSDB synchronization and IS-IS route convergence. If the interval is set too small, the DIS will send CSNPs frequently. This causes high CPU, memory, and network bandwidth usage and affects services.\nPrecautions\nOnly the DIS can periodically send CSNPs. This command is valid only for the device that is elected as the DIS. The DIS can be a Level-1 and Level-2 DIS, and the intervals at which CSNPs are sent must be set respectively.\nIf the isis circuit-type command is run to emulate an interface as a P2P interface, the isis timer csnp command becomes invalid on the interface; after the undo isis circuit-type command is run to restore the broadcast interface, the interval at which CSNPs are sent is restored to the default value."
