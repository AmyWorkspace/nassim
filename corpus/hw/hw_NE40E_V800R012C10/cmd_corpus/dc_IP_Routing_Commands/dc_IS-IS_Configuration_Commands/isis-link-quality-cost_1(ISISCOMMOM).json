    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA bit error indicates the deviation between a bit that is sent and the bit that is received. Bit errors caused by optical fiber aging or optical signal jitter are inevitable on carrier networks. During data transmission, a high bit error rate will degrade or even interrupt services in extreme cases.\nTo ensure network reliability, run the isis ipv6 link-quality low incr-cost command to enable the device to adjust the link cost of an IS-IS interface when its link quality is low. If the IS-IS interface detects that its link quality is low, the device increases the link cost of the interface, so that this link, which has a higher bit error rate, is not selected as the optimal link. After the link quality reverts, the device automatically restores the link cost of the IS-IS interface.\nPrerequisites\nBefore running this command, run the ipv6 enable topology ipv6 command in the IS-IS process to enable the IPv6 function for the process. In the interface view, run the ipv6 enable command to enable the IPv6 function on the interface. Then, run the isis ipv6 enable command to enable the IS-IS function on the interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the isis ipv6 link-quality low incr-cost command is run more than once in the same view, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
