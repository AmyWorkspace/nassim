    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn most cases, to check information about IS-IS neighbors and LSDBs on an IS-IS router, you need to use a system ID of a 12-digit hexadecimal number, for example, aaaa.eeee.1234. This representation, however, is complicated and not easy to use. The dynamic hostname mapping mechanism is introduced to facilitate maintenance and management of IS-IS networks. The is-name command is used to configure a simple hostname for a local Router and enables the Router to advertise it in an LSP.\nAfter the configuration is completed, you can run the display isis name-table command to check the configured hostname.\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created using the isis command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nIf a neighbor relationship has been established, running the is-name command will not cause the neighbor relationship to be reestablished or routes to be updated."
