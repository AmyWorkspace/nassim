    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a large-scale network, there are multiple valid routes destined for the same destination in most cases. IS-IS calculates an optimal route based on the SPF algorithm and transmits traffic over it. This feature may cause the following problems:\nAll traffic is transmitted over the optimal route, causing load imbalance.If the optimal route fails, traffic transmitted over it will be discarded.\nTo address this problem, run the isis cost command to configure different link costs for different interfaces so that traffic can be transmitted over different physical links.\n\nPrerequisites\nIS-IS has been enabled on the interface using the isis enable command in the interface view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the link cost is changed, routes of the entire network are recalculated, and the traffic forwarding path changes accordingly.\nPrecautions\nFor the IGP shortcut-capable TE tunnel interfaces, the link cost is the value set using the mpls te igp metric command.\nIf the isis cost and circuit-cost commands are both run, the value set using the isis cost command takes effect."
