    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure MPLS LDP on an IS-IS interface, you need to enable MPLS LDP globally first and then on the interface. If a large number of interfaces need MPLS LDP, configure them one by one, which is time-consuming and prone to configuration errors. To address this issue, run the mpls ldp auto-config command in the IS-IS view. After the mpls ldp auto-config command is run, MPLS LDP is enabled automatically on all IS-IS-capable interfaces, which simplifies configurations. If you want to disable MPLS LDP automatic configuration, run the undo mpls ldp auto-config command.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS LDP has been enabled globally using the mpls ldp command in the system view, and an IS-IS process has been created using the isis command.\nPrecautions\nAfter the mpls ldp auto-config command is run for an IS-IS process, MPLS LDP is enabled automatically on all interfaces which can establish IS-IS neighbor relationships in the IS-IS process. If you want to disable MPLS LDP from an interface, run the isis mpls ldp auto-config disable command in the interface view."
