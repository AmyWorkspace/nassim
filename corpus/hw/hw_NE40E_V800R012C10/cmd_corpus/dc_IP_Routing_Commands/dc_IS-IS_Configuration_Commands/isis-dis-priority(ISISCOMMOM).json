    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a broadcast network, IS-IS needs to elect a DIS from all devices. If there are Level-1 and Level-2 devices on this network, Level-1 and Level-2 DISs are elected separately and can be the same device or different devices.\nThe DIS is elected as follows: The device whose IS-IS interface has the highest DIS priority is elected as the DIS; If the interfaces on multiple devices have the same DIS priority, the device whose interface has the largest MAC address is elected as the DIS.\nThe isis dis-priority command can be used to set a DIS Priority for an IS-IS interface.\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created, and the IS-IS process has been started on a specified interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf neither Level-1 nor Level-2 is specified in the command, the same priority is set for Level-1 and Level-2 DISs.\nAfter the isis dis-priority command is run, the DIS priority is advertised in Hello packets.\nPrecautions\nThe command takes effect only on the broadcast network.\nIf an Ethernet interface is simulated as a P2P interface using the isis circuit-type command, the isis dis-priority command does not take effect on the Ethernet interface.\nThis command takes effect for both IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces."
