    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIS-IS multi-topology enables multiple independent logical topologies to be deployed in an IS-IS AS. The isis ipv6 topology command is used to associate an IS-IS interface with a topology specified by topology-name.\nAn interface can be associated with multiple IPv6 topologies. To associate an interface with multiple IPv6 topologies, you need to run the isis ipv6 topology command repeatedly, and specify the names for the topologies by setting topology-name in the command.\nPrerequisites\nAn IPv6 topology has been enabled globally, an IPv6 topology instance has been associated with an IS-IS instance using the ipv6 topology command, and IPv6 IS-IS has been enabled on a specified interface.\nPrecautions\nIf an interface has been bound to a VPN, multi-topology cannot be enabled on the interface."
