    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an IS-IS network, if a local LSP changes, the Router sends a purge LSP to advertise the change. If purge LSPs are received or sent frequently and routes are recalculated immediately, a lot of system resources will be consumed. To prevent this problem, run the timer purge-zero-lsp route-calculate-delay command to configure a period for the Router to delay route calculation when the Router receives a purge LSP.\nAfter the command is run, the device triggers suppression by delaying route calculation after it receives a purge LSP with fragment number 0. After the delay-interval elapses, IS-IS exits from suppression. During the suppression period, IS-IS exits from suppression if the device receives a non-purge LSP with fragment number 0.\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created and the IS-IS view has been displayed using the isis command."
