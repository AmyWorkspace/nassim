    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe IS-IS routing table of a device on a medium or large IS-IS network contains a large number of routing entries. Storing the routing table consumes a large number of memory resources, and transmitting and processing routes consume lots of network resources. IS-IS route summarization can solve this problem.\nRoutes with the same IPv4 prefix can be summarized into one route. The system then advertises the summary route to other network segments. Route summarization on a large-scale IS-IS network reduces the number of routes in a routing table and minimizes system resource consumption. In addition, if a specific link frequently alternates between Up and Down, the links not involved in the route summarization will not be affected, which prevents route flapping and improves network security.\nConfiguring route summarization does not affect the routing table on a local device. Each specific route is displayed in the routing table. Configuring route summarization, however, reduces the number of LSPs to be flooded. Any device that receives the LSP from the summarization-capable router has only one summary route in its routing table.\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created and the IS-IS view has been displayed using the isis command.\nPrecautions\nThe routes to be summarized can be the routes discovered by IS-IS or routes imported from other routing protocols. The cost of the summarized route is the smallest cost of the routes that are summarized."
