    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a large-scale network, there are multiple valid routes destined for the same destination in most cases. IS-IS calculates an optimal route based on the SPF algorithm and transmits traffic over it. This feature may cause the following problems:\nAll traffic is transmitted over the optimal route, causing load imbalance.If the optimal route fails, traffic transmitted over it will be discarded.\nTo address this problem, run the isis ipv6 cost command to configure different link costs for different interfaces so that traffic can be transmitted over different physical links.\n\nPrerequisites\nIS-IS has been enabled on the interface using the isis enable command in the interface view.\nIPv6 has been enabled for the IS-IS process, and an IPv6 topology has been enabled. To enable IPv6 in an IS-IS process, run the isis ipv6 enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the link cost is changed, routes of the entire network are recalculated, and the traffic forwarding path changes accordingly.\nPrecautions\nThe isis ipv6 cost command takes effect only when links are active and an IPv6 topology is enabled.\nIf the IPv6 topology type is compatible or standard, the IPv6 link cost is the same as the IPv4 link cost. When an IPv6 topology type is compatible enable-mt-spf or ipv6, IPv6 and IPv4 link costs need to be configured separately.\nIf the isis ipv6 cost and ipv6 circuit-cost commands are both run, the value set using the isis ipv6 cost takes effect."
