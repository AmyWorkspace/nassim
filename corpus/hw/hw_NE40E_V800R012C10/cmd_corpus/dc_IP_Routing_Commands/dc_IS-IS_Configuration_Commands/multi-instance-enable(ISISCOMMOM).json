    ],
    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTraditionally, only one IS-IS process can be configured on an interface. If multiple IS-IS processes are required, multiple interfaces are needed, and the interface configuration workload is heavy. To reduce the interface count and configuration workload, you can run the multi-instance enable command to configure IS-IS multi-instance processes. A conventional IS-IS process and multiple IS-IS multi-instance processes can be configured on the same interface.\nIf no IID is manually configured for an IS-IS process, this process is referred to as a conventional IS-IS process; if an IID is manually configured for an IS-IS process, this process is referred to as an IS-IS multi-instance process.\nPrecautions\nThis command conflicts with bfd all-interfaces enable and ipv6 bfd all-interfaces enable commands."
