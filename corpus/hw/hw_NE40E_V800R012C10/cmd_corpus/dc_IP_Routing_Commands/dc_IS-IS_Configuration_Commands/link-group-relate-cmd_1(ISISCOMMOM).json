    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the link cost of the member links in a link group is increased due to a link failure, traffic is switched to a backup link. You can run the revert-members command to configure the number of available member links that triggers a link cost restoration so that the original link cost is restored when the link failure is cleared and the number of available member links reaches or exceeds revert-num. Then, routes are recalculated, and traffic is forwarded along the optimal route.\nPrerequisites\nA link group has been created using the link-group command.\nPrecautions\nThe value of revert-num must be greater than or equal to that of min-members configured in the min-members command."
