    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe reset isis peer command is used when a device needs to re-establish the neighbor relationship with a specified neighbor.\nIf process-id is not specified in the reset isis peer command, all IS-IS processes re-establish neighbor relationships with a specified neighbor.\nThis command is used to re-establish neighbor relationships with a specified neighbor, which may cause route flapping. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command."
