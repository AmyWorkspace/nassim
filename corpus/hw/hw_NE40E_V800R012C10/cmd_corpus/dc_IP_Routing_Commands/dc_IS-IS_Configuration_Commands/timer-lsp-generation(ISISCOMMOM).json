    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFor IS-IS, when the local routing information is changed, some new LSPs (or LSP fragments) need to be generated to advertise the change of routes. If the change occurs frequently, immediate generation of LSPs (or LSP fragments) will consume a large number of resources.\nTo speed up network convergence and prevent the system from being affected, use an intelligent timer to control the LSP generation interval. Using the timer, you can adjust the LSP generation interval based on the route change frequency.\nBefore using the\ntimer lsp-generation command, note the following:\nWhen only max-interval is specified, the intelligent timer functions as a one-shot timer.If init-interval and incr-interval are specified, init-interval is used as the LSP generation interval for the first time, and incr-interval is used as the LSP generation interval for the second time. From the third time on, the LSP generation interval doubles each time until the interval reaches max-interval. If the local routing information keeps being updated within the max-interval period, the interval remains at max-interval until the time the local routing information is not updated within the max-interval period or the IS-IS process is restarted. Then the interval decreases to init-interval.If init-interval is specified, but incr-interval is not, init-interval is used as the LSP generation interval for the first time, and then max-interval is used as the interval. If the local routing information keeps being updated within the max-interval period, the interval remains at max-interval until the time the local routing information is not updated within the max-interval period or the IS-IS process is restarted. Then the interval decreases to init-interval.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created using the isis command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the LSP generation interval is too long, the router cannot advertise its changes to neighbors in time, which slows down network convergence.\nPrecautions\nWhen the network topology changes for the first time, the device immediately generates LSPs to notify the changes and then starts the intelligent timer."
