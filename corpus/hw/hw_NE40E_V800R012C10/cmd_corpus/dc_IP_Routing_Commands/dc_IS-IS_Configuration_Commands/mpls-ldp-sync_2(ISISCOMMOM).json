    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an active link between two devices enabled with synchronization between LDP and IS-IS recovers from a fault, the IS-IS module enters the Hold-down state and starts a Hold-down timer. This timer allows the devices to create an LDP session and an LDP adjacency and set up an IS-IS neighbor relationship at the same time. Traffic can be switched back to the active link over a reachable IS-IS route for an established LDP LSP.\nTo set the Hold-down time for all interfaces within an IS-IS process, run the timer ldp-sync hold-down command.\nPrecautions\nIf both the timer ldp-sync hold-down command and the isis timer ldp-sync hold-down command in the interface view are executed, the isis timer ldp-sync hold-down command takes effect."
