    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn large networks, there may be multiple valid routes to the same destination. IS-IS uses the SPF algorithm to calculate an optimal route and transmits traffic over it, which brings the problem that all traffic is transmitted over the optimal route, causing load imbalance.\nTo solve the preceding problems, run the circuit-cost command to set a link cost for interfaces so that traffic can be transmitted over different physical links.\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created using the isis command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the link cost of an interface is changed, routes will be re-calculated on the whole network, causing the changes in traffic forwarding paths.\nPrecautions\nFor the IGP shortcut-enabled TE tunnel interface, the link cost is the value configured using the mpls te igp metric command.\nThe priority of the circuit-cost command is lower than that of the isis cost command.\nTo allow the link cost of IS-IS routes to reflect the actual link cost, configuring a proper link cost for an interface is recommended.\nIf the command is run in the IS-IS topology view, it takes effect only in the current topology."
