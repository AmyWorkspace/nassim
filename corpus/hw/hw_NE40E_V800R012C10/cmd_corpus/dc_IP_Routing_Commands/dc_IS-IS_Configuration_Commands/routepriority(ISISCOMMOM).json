    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a routing table has a large number of routing entries on an IS-IS device, it takes a long time to implement the SPF calculation on the device. The prefix-priority command can be used to allow some key routes to be preferentially calculated.\nPrerequisites\nIf tag values are used to filter IS-IS routes, it is required that the cost type of IS-IS not be narrow and IS-IS routes carry tag values.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe convergence priorities of IS-IS routes can be critical, high, medium, low, and very-low. The priorities in the corresponding IP routing table are critical, high, high, medium, and low. The priorities are listed in descending order.\nThe convergence priority of IS-IS routes is used as follows:\nFor the existing IS-IS routes, IS-IS resets the convergence priority for the routes based on the prefix-priority command.For the newly added IS-IS routes, IS-IS sets the convergence priority for the routes based on the filtering result of the prefix-priority command.If an IS-IS route matches the matching rules of multiple convergence priorities, the highest convergence priority is used.If an IS-IS route matches tags of multiple convergence priorities, the highest convergence priority is used.If the route level is not specified, IS-IS configures convergence priorities for both Level-1 routes and Level-2 routes.\n\nPrecautions\nThe convergence priority of IS-IS routes (including the IS-IS host routes and default routes) can be specified or changed using the prefix-priority command. After the prefix-priority command is run, the convergence priority of the routes (including the IS-IS host routes and default routes) unspecified by the command is changed to low."
