    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an NG MVPN scenario, multicast data flows must be transmitted on a link that has no or few bit errors because even low bit error rates may cause black screen, erratic display, or frame interruption. If multiple links exist between the upstream and downstream nodes of an mLDP tunnel and some links are logical instead of physical direct links, the upstream node randomly selects an outbound interface by default, and sends packets over the link of the selected interface to the downstream node. If you expect the mLDP upstream node to detect bit error rates of the links and switch to an outbound interface that is connected to a downstream link with few or no bit errors, run the bfd bit-error all-interfaces enable command to enable BFD-based bit error detection.\nAfter the bfd bit-error all-interfaces enable command is run in the IS-IS process view, BFD-based bit error detection is enabled on all interfaces in the process. If an interface does not need the function, run the isis bfd bit-error block command to block the function.\nPrerequisites\nIS-IS has been enabled on the interface using the isis enable command.\nPrecautions\nThe isis bfd bit-error block command and isis bfd bit-error enable command are mutually exclusive in function, and the later configuration overwrites the previous one."
