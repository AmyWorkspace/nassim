    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf IS-IS remote FRR is enabled and the primary link fails, traffic is switched to the backup link. If route convergence occurs again, traffic is switched from the backup link to a new primary link. During the switchover, microloop may occur. To prevent this problem, IS-IS anti-microloop is enabled by the avoid-microloop frr-protected command.\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created and the IS-IS view has been displayed using the isis command."
