    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a Down IS-IS interface goes Up, IS-IS neighbor relationships are re-established on the interface, and traffic is switched back to this Up interface after IGP route convergence. IGP route convergence is fast, but many services that depend on IGP routes may not expect such fast traffic switchback. To delay traffic switchback after IGP route convergence, run the isis peer hold-max-cost command to set the maximum holdtime for the largest IS-IS route cost (16777214 in wide mode and 63 in narrow mode) in local LSPs. In this manner, before the specified maximum holdtime expires, traffic is not switched back to this route due to its large cost. After the specified maximum holdtime expires, the route cost reverts to the original value, and then traffic is switched back to this route.\nThe effective time of the specified maximum holdtime is different for P2P and broadcast neighbors.\nFor a P2P neighbor, the maximum holdtime takes effect after the neighbor relationship goes Up.For a broadcast neighbor, the maximum holdtime takes effect after the neighbor relationship goes Up and then a DIS is elected successfully.\n\nPrecautions\nThis command takes effect both for IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 and IPv6 use the same hold-max-cost timer on interfaces."
