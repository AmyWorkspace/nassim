    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe IS-IS session-CAR function is enabled by default. It isolates packet channels between IS-IS sessions.\nTo disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car isis disable command. IS-IS packets received by this device will be sent directly to the CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of IS-IS packets, packets from different IS-IS sessions may preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not usually recommended."
