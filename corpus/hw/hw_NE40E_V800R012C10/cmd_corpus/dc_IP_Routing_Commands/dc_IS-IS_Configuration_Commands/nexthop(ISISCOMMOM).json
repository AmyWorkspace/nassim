    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen multiple redundant links are available on an IS-IS network, there may be multiple equal-cost routes among them.\nThe nexthop command is used to set a priority for a next hop. After the command is run, equal-cost routes are selected based on the configured priority, and the interface costs do not need to be changed. The smaller the value parameter, the higher the priority of the next hop.\nBy default, an IS-IS device forwards traffic in load balancing mode.\nPrerequisites\nIS-IS processes have been enabled, and the IS-IS routing table contains multiple equal-cost routes.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the nexthop command is run, an IS-IS device does not forward traffic in load balancing mode to a specific destination network segment, but forwards traffic to the next hop with the highest priority."
