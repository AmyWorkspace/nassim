    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the rules for sending IS-IS Hello packets on P2P interfaces and broadcast interfaces are as follows:\nFor a P2P interfaceBefore the P2P neighbor relationship is established, the P2P interface sends the standard Hello packet with the padding field.After the P2P neighbor relationship is established, the P2P interface sends the small-sized Hello packet without the padding field.\nFor a P2P interface, the length of padding field is equal to the length of LSP packets originate by local IS.\nFor a broadcast interface\nIt sends the standard Hello packet with the padding field.\nFor a broadcast interface, the length of padding field is equal to the length of MTU.\nGenerally, if multiple logical interfaces configured on the same interface need to establish a large number of neighbor relationships, the interface frequently sends standard Hello packets. This wastes the network bandwidth. In this case, run the isis small-hello command to save the network bandwidth.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created on a specified interface.\nPrecautions\nThe isis small-hello and isis padding-hello commands are mutually exclusive."
