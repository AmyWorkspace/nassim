    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBFD can provide millisecond-level fault detection, help IS-IS to detect the faults that occur on neighboring devices or links more quickly, and instruct IS-IS to recalculate routes for correct packet forwarding. To enable all IS-IS interfaces to dynamically establish IPv6 BFD sessions, run the ipv6 bfd all-interfaces enable command on the interfaces. To disable an interface from dynamically establishing IPv6 BFD sessions, run the isis ipv6 bfd block command.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been enabled globally, and the IS-IS process has been started on a specified interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the isis ipv6 bfd block command is run on an interface, the interface is disabled from dynamically establishing BFD sessions. As a result, fast link fault detection cannot be implemented.\nPrecautions\nIf the isis ipv6 bfd block, isis ipv6 bfd enable, and isis ipv6 bfd static commands are run, only the last command takes effect."
