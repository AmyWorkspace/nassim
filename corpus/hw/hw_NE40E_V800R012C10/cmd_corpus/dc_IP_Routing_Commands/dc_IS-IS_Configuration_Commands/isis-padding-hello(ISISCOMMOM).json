    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the rules for sending IS-IS Hello packets on P2P interfaces and broadcast interfaces are as follows:\nFor a P2P interfaceBefore the P2P neighbor relationship is established, the P2P interface sends the standard Hello packet with the padding field.After the P2P neighbor relationship is established, the P2P interface sends the small-sized Hello packet without the padding field.For a P2P interface, the length of padding field is equal to the length of LSP packets originated by local IS.\n\nFor a broadcast interfaceIt sends the standard Hello packet with the padding field.\nFor a broadcast interface, the length of padding field is equal to the length of MTU.\n\nThe isis padding-hello command enables a device to send Hello packets to neighbors according to its interface MTU. If the interfaces of neighbors do not support the interface MTU of the device, neighbor relationships cannot be established. This prevents the LSDB asynchronization when only smaller PDUs are transmitted and larger PDUs are discarded after neighbor relationships are established.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created on a specified interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe isis padding-hello command is used to configure an interface to send the standard Hello packets with the padding field. The isis padding-hello command and the isis small-hello command are mutually exclusive. The isis small-hello command is used to configure an interface to send the small-sized Hello packets without the padding field."
