    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, FRR calculates a backup link based on the LFA algorithm, and the backup link together with the active link is added to the forwarding table. If an error occurs on the network, FRR can fast switch traffic to the backup link before route convergence on the control plane. This feature ensures uninterrupted traffic forwarding and greatly improves the reliability of IS-IS networks.\nBy default, an IS-IS interface can participate in LFA calculation. However, some backup links are uncertain when an active link is faulty. To prevent traffic from being transmitted along a link, you can run the undo isis lfa-backup command on the interface on the link to disable the interface from participating in the LFA calculation.\nPrecautions\nTo ensure that FRR can function properly, do not disable all interfaces from participating in the LFA calculation."
