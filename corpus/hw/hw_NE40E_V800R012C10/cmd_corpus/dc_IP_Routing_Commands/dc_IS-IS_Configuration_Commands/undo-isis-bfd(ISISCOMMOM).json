    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBFD can provide millisecond-level fault detection, help IS-IS to detect the faults that occur on neighboring devices or links more quickly, and instruct IS-IS to recalculate routes for correct packet forwarding. The isis bfd command can be used to set values for BFD session parameters on an interface.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been enabled globally, and the isis bfd enable command has been run on the interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe minimum interval at which BFD packets are received is obtained after the receive-interval value and the remote transmit-interval value are compared. If the local end does not receive any BFD packet from its neighbor within the period (minimum interval at which BFD packets are received x multiplier-value), the local end declares the neighbor Down.\nPrecautions\nThe priority of BFD configured on an interface is higher than that of BFD configured in a process. If BFD is enabled on an interface, BFD sessions are established with the BFD parameters set on the interface.\nThe set BFD session parameters take effect only when BFD is enabled on the interface."
