That is, the interface is suppressed from sending and receiving IS-IS packets, but the routes to the network segment of the interface can be advertised.\nThe undo isis silent command restores the default configuration.\nBy default, no IS-IS interface is configured as a silent interface.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an IS-IS network is connected to other ASs, IS-IS must be enabled on the interfaces that connect the IS-IS network to other ASs so that the Routers on the IS-IS network can learn the routes to other ASs. The interfaces, however, unnecessarily advertise IS-IS Hello packets on their network segments. In this situation, you can run the isis silent command to suppress the interfaces.\nPrerequisites\nIS-IS has been enabled using the isis enable command in the interface view."
