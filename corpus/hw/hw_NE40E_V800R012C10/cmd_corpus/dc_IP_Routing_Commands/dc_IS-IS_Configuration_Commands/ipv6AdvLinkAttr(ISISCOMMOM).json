The link attribute includes an IPv6 address and an interface index.\nThe undo ipv6 advertise link attributes command disables the IS-IS process from advertising TLVs related to IPv6 link attributes in LSPs.\nBy default, the IPv6 link attribute advertisement function is disabled on an IS-IS process.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the IS-IS process to advertise IPv6 link attributes, the following conditions must be met:\nIn the IS-IS view, run the cost-style command to set the cost type of IS-IS packets to wide, compatible, or wide-compatible.In the IS-IS view, run the ipv6 enable command to enable the IPv6 capability of the IS-IS process.\nThis command can be used to control the advertisement of TLV attributes 22 and 222, depending on whether the IPv6 address family of the link on the corresponding topology is active."
