    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf IS-IS remote FRR is enabled and the primary link fails, traffic is switched to the backup link. If route convergence occurs again, traffic is switched from the backup link to a new primary link. During the switchover, microloop may occur. To prevent this problem, IS-IS anti-microloop is enabled by default and delays the switching. To configure a delay after which IS-IS delivers routes, run the avoid-microloop frr-protected rib-update-delay command. After the command is run, IS-IS does not implement route convergence or switch traffic to the backup link in the preceding scenario until the delay elapses.\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created and the IS-IS view has been displayed using the isis command."
