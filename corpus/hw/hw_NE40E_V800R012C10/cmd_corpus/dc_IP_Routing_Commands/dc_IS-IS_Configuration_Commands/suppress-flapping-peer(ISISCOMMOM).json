    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an interface carrying IS-IS services alternates between Up and Down, IS-IS neighbor relationship flapping occurs on the interface. During the flapping, IS-IS reestablishes the neighbor relationship and recalculates routes. In this process, a large number of packets are exchanged, adversely affecting neighbor relationship stability, IS-IS services, and other IS-IS-dependent services. IS-IS neighbor relationship flapping suppression can address this problem by delaying IS-IS neighbor relationship reestablishment or preventing service traffic from passing through flapping links.\nBy default, IS-IS neighbor relationship flapping suppression is enabled globally. To disable this function globally, run the suppress-flapping peer disable command."
