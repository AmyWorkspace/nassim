For example, after the area-authentication-mode and domain-authentication-mode commands are run, you can run the reset isis all command to clear the old LSPs remaining on the device. If an IS-IS process inside the port extension system is enabled, you can run the reset isis virtual-access all command to clear the LSPs exist in the IS-IS process inside the port extension system.\nPrecautions\nRestarting an IS-IS process may interrupt services. Therefore, exercise caution when running the reset isis all command.\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
