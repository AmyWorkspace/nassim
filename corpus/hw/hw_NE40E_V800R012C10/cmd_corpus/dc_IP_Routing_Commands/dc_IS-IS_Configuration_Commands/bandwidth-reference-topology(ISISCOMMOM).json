    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can configure a link cost for all interfaces or enable automatic interface cost calculation. To enable automatic interface cost calculation, you need to set a proper bandwidth reference value.\nPrerequisites\nAn IS-IS process has been created.\nConfiguration Impact\nYou can run the bandwidth-reference command to set a proper bandwidth reference value. After automatic interface cost calculation is enabled, and the cost type is wide or wide-compatible, the system calculates the cost of each interface with the following formula: Interface cost = (Bandwidth-reference/Interface bandwidth) * 10. If the interface cost calculated through this formula is greater than 16777214, 16777214 is used as the interface cost for route calculation. That is, the interface cost will never be greater than 16777214.\nThe automatic interface cost calculation is enabled by the auto-cost enable command, and the cost style is set by the cost-style command.\nPrecautions\nSet a proper bandwidth reference value.\nIf the command is run in the IS-IS view, it takes effect only in the base topology. If the command is run in the IS-IS topology view, it takes effect only in the current topology."
