    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo ensure network security, you can enable a router to authenticate received packets based on the pre-defined authentication mode or add authentication information to the packets to be sent. Only the packets that are authenticated can be forwarded on the network.\nThe domain-authentication-mode command enables the local node to discard all the Level-2 LSPs and SNPs with area authentication passwords that are different from the one set using this command. You can also add area authentication passwords to all the Level-2 LSPs and SNPs sent by this node.\nThe domain-authentication-mode command is valid for all topologies in an IS-IS process but only on Level-2 or Level-1-2 routers.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the area-authentication-mode command is run on the local device, the device discards newly received Level-2 LSP and SNP packets if these packets fail to be authenticated. However, the device does not discard the Level-2 LSP packets in the local LSDB immediately if they fail to be authenticated. Instead, the device waits for the LSP packets to be aged out. To prevent packet loss before the area-authentication-mode command is run on the IS-IS neighbor, specify the send-only parameter in the command on all the IS-IS devices.\nPrecautions\nIf the password is set, but neither ip nor osi is specified, the system defaults it as osi.\nWhen a keychain password is used, the parameter ip or osi cannot be configured.\nThe authentication takes effect only on the interface where the command is run, but other interfaces can still receive the LSPs carrying the password."
