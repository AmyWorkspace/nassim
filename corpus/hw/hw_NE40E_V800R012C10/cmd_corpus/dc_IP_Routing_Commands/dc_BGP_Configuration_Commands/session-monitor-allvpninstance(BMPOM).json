    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBMP is used to monitor BGP running status of devices in real time, such as the establishment and termination status of BGP peer relationships and route update status. To allow the BGP running status of BGP peers in all VPN instance address families to be monitored, run the monitor all-vpn-instance command. After a TCP connection is established between the device and the monitoring server, the device reports BGP running status to the monitoring server, improving network monitoring efficiency.\nFollow-up Procedure\nPerform either of the following operations as required:\nRun the route-mode { { ipv4-family | ipv6-family } unicast | { ipv4-family labeled-unicast } } adj-rib-in { pre-policy | post-policy } command to set the type of RIB-in route (received from all peers in a specified address family of a specified VPN instance) whose statistics are to be sent by the device to the monitoring server.Run the route-mode { { ipv4-family | ipv6-family } unicast | { ipv4-family labeled-unicast } } adj-rib-out { pre-policy | post-policy } command to set the type of RIB-out route (to be advertised or already advertised to all peers in a specified address family of a specified VPN instance) whose statistics are to be sent by the device to the monitoring server.Run the route-mode { { ipv4-family | ipv6-family } unicast | { ipv4-family labeled-unicast } } local-rib [ add-path ] command to configure the device to send statistics about Local-RIB routes of all BGP peers in a specified address family of the VPN instance to the monitoring server."
