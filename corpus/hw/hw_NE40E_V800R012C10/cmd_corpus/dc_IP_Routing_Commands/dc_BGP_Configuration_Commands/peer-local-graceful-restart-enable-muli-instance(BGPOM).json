    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a device supports GR but a BGP peer specified on the device does not support GR, you can run the peer local-graceful-restart enable command on the device to enable local GR for the peer. This configuration ensures that the device does not delete the routes received from the peer and related forwarding entries before the GR time elapses, thereby preventing traffic interruption.\nPrecautions\nIf a peer specified on a device does not support GR, you are advised to enable local GR for the peer."
