    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the device is an ASBR, the optimal route must have recursed to an LSP; if load balancing or FRR is configured on the ASBR, the non-optimal routes must recurse to LSPs so that these routes can participate in load balancing or FRR. The bestroute nexthop-resolved tunnel command can be run to allow route selection only after the BGP VPNv4/6 routes recurse to LSPs.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe bestroute nexthop-resolved ip command is mutually exclusive with the bestroute nexthop-resolved tunnel command.\nThe bestroute nexthop-resolved tunnel command is mutually exclusive with the bestroute nexthop-resolved tunnel inherit-ip-cost command."
