    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe display bgp mvpn peer command displays BGP MVPN peer information. You can implement the following operations based on the command output:\nTo check the status of BGP connectionsTo check information about a BGP peerTo check whether a BGP peer is configured using the peer as-number commandTo check whether a BGP peer is deleted using the undo peer as-number command\nThe display bgp mvpn peer command can be used for troubleshooting, with details as follows: If BGP peers are disconnected, specify log-info in the command to check the log information of the specified peer. In the command output, Date/Time indicates the time when the peers were disconnected, and Error Code and Error Subcode indicate the cause of the disconnection.\nTo check information about slow MVPN BGP peers, run the display mvpn bgp slow-peer command. The information includes the time when a peer began to be identified as a slow peer, the time when a peer last exited from the slow peer state, the number of times a peer has been identified as a slow peer, and the remaining time for a peer to exit from the slow peer state."
