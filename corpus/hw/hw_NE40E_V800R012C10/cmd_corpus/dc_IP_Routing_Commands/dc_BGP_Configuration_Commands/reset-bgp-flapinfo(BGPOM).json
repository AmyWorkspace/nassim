    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe process of adding a route to and then deleting the route from a routing table is called route flapping.\nWhen route flapping occurs, the routing protocol sends Update packets to neighbors. The neighbors that receive the Update packets need to recalculate routes and modify its routing table. Therefore, frequent route flapping consumes great bandwidth and CPU resources and even seriously affects network operations.\nThe reset bgp flap-info command is used to clear the flapping information about routes. This allows the Router to re-collect statistics about flapping routes and helps to monitor route changes and locate network problems.\nPrerequisites\nYou can use display bgp routing-table flap-info command to view the information about BGP route flapping.\nIf there are a large number of flapping routes, define an AS_Path filter or an AS_Path regular expression to be referenced in the reset bgp flap-info command. The flapping statistics of the routes matching the AS_Path filter or the AS_Path regular expression are then cleared.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the reset bgp flap-info command is run, the flapping statistics of routes are reset and cannot be displayed.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the flapping statistics of routes are cleared, run the display bgp routing-table flap-info command again to display the flapping statistics about BGP routes in order to locate problems."
