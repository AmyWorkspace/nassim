    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, when a local device receives a route (route A) having the same prefix as that of a route (route B) in the local VPN routing table from the remote end but route A and route B have different RDs, route B is also sent to a BGP VPNv4/VPNv6 routing table even if the route selection priority of route B is lower than that of route A. If route B meets BGP VPNv4/VPNv6 route sending conditions, it is also sent to other BGP VPNv4/VPNv6 peers. In this scenario, if you want only optimal BGP VPN routes to be transmitted between BGP VPNv4/VPNv6 peers on the network, run the advertise best-route command on the local device to send only optimal routes in the BGP VPN routing table to the BGP VPNv4/VPNv6 routing table.\nBy default, the device advertises all routes in the BGP VPN routing table to the BGP VPNv4/VPNv6 routing table. For example, the supernet unicast routes are invalid, but VPNv4 and VPNv6 routing tables have such routes. In addition, forwarding entries are generated for such routes, and the routes are advertised to peers. You can run the advertise valid-routes command to configure a device to send only valid routes in a BGP VPN routing table to a BGP VPNv4/VPNv6 routing table."
