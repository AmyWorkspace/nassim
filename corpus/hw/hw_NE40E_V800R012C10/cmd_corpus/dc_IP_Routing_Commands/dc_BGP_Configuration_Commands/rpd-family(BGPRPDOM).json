    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a MAN ingress or IGW scenario, uneven link resource usage or link faults may cause link congestion. To make full use of network bandwidth, you can deploy an inbound traffic optimization solution to adjust route priorities so that traffic is diverted to idle links. In such a scenario, the Router functions as a forwarder, and RPD needs to be deployed on it.\nRPD provides a new method of distributing route-policies. After the BGP RPD address family view is created on a device, the device can receive the RPD routes delivered by the NCE and generate dynamic route-policies for the peers of the address family.\nPrecautions\nIf the undo rpd-family command is run, all configurations in the BGP RPD address family view are deleted, and the device no longer generates dynamic route-policies based on the RPD routes received from the NCE. Therefore, exercise caution when running the command."
