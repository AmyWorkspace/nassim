    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBFD for BGP tunnel rapidly detects faults in E2E BGP tunnels. Before a BGP BFD session is established, the mpls bgp bfd enable command must be run to enable MPLS to dynamically establish BGP BFD sessions on the ingress of a BGP tunnel. To specify a policy used to establish BGP BFD sessions, run the mpls bgp bfd-trigger-tunnel command.Either of the following policies can be used:- Host address-based policy: used when all host addresses can be used to establish BGP BFD sessions. - IP prefix list-based policy: used when only some host addresses can be used to establish BFD sessions.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been globally enabled using the bfd command.\nPrecautions\nIf the mpls bgp bfd-trigger-tunnel command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
