If the valid-route parameter is not specified, only active BGP routes among valid BGP routes are imported.\nIf the include-label-route parameter is specified in the import-rib vpn-instance command, the device will import the labeled routes that are received from BGP peers and that are leaked to the specified VPN instance.\nIf you want newly imported BGP routes to be preferentially selected, specify the route-policy route-policy-name or route-filter route-filter-name parameter so that the BGP attribute values in the filtered routes to be imported can be changed using the specified route-policy or route-filter.\nPrecautions\nIf the route-policy route-policy-name parameter is specified in the import-rib vpn-instance command, the if-match interface command configuration in the route-policy will not take effect.\nThe import-rib vpn-instance command configuration does not take effect for unlabeled routes that are leaked locally or remotely. Nor does this configuration take effect for the routes imported using the import-route command or network command."
