    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the ebgp-interface-sensitive command is not configured, the system does not immediately select a sub-optimal route for packet transmission if the local interface goes Down. Instead, the system waits for a period (180s by default) before checking whether another interface can be used to send packets to the same destination address. This will interrupt services for a period of time. If the ebgp-interface-sensitive command is run, BGP can fast detect an EBGP link failure and use another interface to establish a BGP peer relationship with the remote peer.\nIf the interface used for a BGP connection alternates between Up and Down, run the undo ebgp-interface-sensitive command to prevent repeated BGP session deletion and reestablishment caused by route flapping, which reduces network bandwidth consumption.\nPrecautions\nIf the interface used for a BGP connection alternates between Up and Down, do not run the ebgp-interface-sensitive command."
