    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRunning this command causes all BGP peers unable to establish sessions. Exercise caution when using this command.\nDuring the system upgrade, or maintenance, you can run the shutdown command to terminate all sessions between a device and its BGP peers to prevent possible BGP route flapping from affecting the network. After the system upgrade, or maintenance, run the undo shutdown command to restore the sessions. If a large number of BGP sessions exist, terminating BGP sessions one by one using the peer ignore command is inefficient. Running the shutdown command in the BGP view terminates all BGP sessions at one time.\nAlthough BGP sessions take effect only after you run the commit command in two-phase validation mode, the shutdown command is necessary in the following situations:\nThe two-phase validation mode is changed to the immediate validation mode.Some configurations have been committed.The script files are used for the upgrade or maintenance.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
