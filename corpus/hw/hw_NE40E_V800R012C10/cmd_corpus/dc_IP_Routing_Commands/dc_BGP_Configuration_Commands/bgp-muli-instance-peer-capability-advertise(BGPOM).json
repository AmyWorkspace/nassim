    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThere are multiple optional BGP functions when a BGP peer advertises routes to its peer. The optional BGP functions include route-refresh, general router function, 4-byte AS number, and Add-Path. You can run the peer capability-advertise command to select one of the functions based on the needs on the live network.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf you enable or disable the route-refresh, general router, 4-byte AS number, or Add-Path function, the BGP peer relationship will be re-established, which can lead to a temporary network interruption. Therefore, exercise caution when running the related commands."
