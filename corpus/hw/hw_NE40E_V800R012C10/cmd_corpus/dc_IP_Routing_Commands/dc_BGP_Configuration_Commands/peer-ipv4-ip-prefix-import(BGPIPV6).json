    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer ipv6-prefix import command can be used to configure a route filtering policy that is based on an IPv6 prefix list for filtering BGP routes to be received from a specified peer, implementing route control.\nPrerequisites\nIf the peer ipv6-prefix command specifies an IPv6 prefix list that does not exist for a peer, use the ip ipv6-prefix command to create an IPv6 prefix list.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf an IPv6 prefix list is specified for a peer group, all the members of the peer group inherit the configuration.\nAfter an IPv6 prefix list is specified for a peer, the peer filter the routes to be received from other peers based on the IPv6 prefix list. Only the routes that pass the filtering of the IPv6 prefix list can be received.\nPrecautions\nThe peer ipv6-prefix import command is mutually exclusive with the peer route-filter import commands."
