    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter an RPKI session is established between a router and an RPKI server, you can run the prefix origin-validation enable command to enable BGP origin AS validation. After BGP origin AS validation is enabled, the router periodically queries Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) from the RPKI server and matches the origin AS of each received BGP route against the ROAs. The validation result can be Valid, Not Found, or Invalid.\nThe BGP origin AS validation result can be applied to route selection and advertised to BGP peers."
