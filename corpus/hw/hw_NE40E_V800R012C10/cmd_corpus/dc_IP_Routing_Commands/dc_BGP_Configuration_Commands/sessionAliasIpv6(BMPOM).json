    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBMP is used to monitor BGP running status of devices in real time, such as the establishment and termination status of BGP peer relationships and route update status. After a TCP connection is established between a device and a monitoring server, the device reports BGP running status to the monitoring server, improving network monitoring efficiency. To specify a BMP session address for a BMP device to establish a TCP session with a monitoring server, run the bmp-session command. If the command is not run, a BMP device cannot establish TCP connections with any monitoring servers, and therefore its BGP running status cannot be monitored on any servers.\nPrecautions\nIf a device needs to establish TCP connections with multiple monitoring servers, specify different IP addresses. If the device needs to establish multiple TCP connections with the same monitoring server through different port numbers, specify one IP address and different session aliases (through the alias-name parameter) for differentiation."
