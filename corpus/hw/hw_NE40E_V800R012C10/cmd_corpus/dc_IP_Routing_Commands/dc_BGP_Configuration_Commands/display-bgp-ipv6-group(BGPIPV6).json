    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nConfiguring BGP peer groups simplifies BGP network configuration and improves route advertisement efficiency.\nThe\ndisplay bgp group command displays peer group information, including peers in the peer group and configuration information about the peer group. The\ndisplay bgp group command is used in the following scenarios:\nVerify the configuration after a peer group is configured using the group command.Verify the configuration after a peer is added to a peer group using the peer group command.Verify the configuration after a peer is deleted from a peer group using the undo peer group command.Verify the configuration after modifying the configuration of a peer group.\n\nPrecautions\nBGP has multiple address families, each of which is configured independently. Information about peer groups in address families can be displayed by specifying different parameters."
