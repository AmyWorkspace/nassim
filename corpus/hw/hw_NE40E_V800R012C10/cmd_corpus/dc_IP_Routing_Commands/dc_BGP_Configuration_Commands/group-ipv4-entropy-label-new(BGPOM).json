    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf load balancing is uneven on a network, you can run the peer entropy-label command to enable the entropy label capability for the device. This capability is effective in scenarios where traffic is forwarded along received BGP routes that carry the entropy label. Therefore, you also need to run the peer advertise-entropy-label elc command on the peer to enable the peer to add the entropy label of the entropy label capability (ELC) type to routes to be advertised to the local device. The two configurations help equalize and improve the performance of load balancing.\nPrecautions\nIf the peer entropy-label command is run in the BGP-IPv4 unicast address family, the configuration takes effect only for labeled routes."
