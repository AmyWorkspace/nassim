    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo ensure that the devices can communicate with other devices that do not support standard AS confederation, run the command on all devices in a confederation.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the confederation ID is configured, running the confederation nonstandard command will disconnect the sessions between a router and its IBGP peers as well as its confederation EBGP peers. Then, new connections are re-established."
