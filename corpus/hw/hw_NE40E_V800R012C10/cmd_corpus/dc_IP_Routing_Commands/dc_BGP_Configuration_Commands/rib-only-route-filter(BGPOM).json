    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a route reflector (RR) is used and preferred BGP routes do not need to be used during the forwarding, the routing-table rib-only command can be used to make BGP routes unable to be added to the IP routing table or the forwarding layer. This improves forwarding efficiency and the system capacity.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the routing-table rib-only command is run, the routes preferred by BGP are not added to the IP routing table.\nPrecautions\nThe routing-table rib-only command and the active-route-advertise command are mutually exclusive."
