    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a device to advertise the Link Bandwidth extended community attribute to a specified EBGP peer, run the peer advertise ebgp link-bandwidth command.\nAfter a peer is added to a peer group, the peer inherits the configuration of the peer group. If the peer advertise ebgp link-bandwidth command is run on the local device for the peer group and the newly added peer does not need to inherit this configuration, you need to run the peer advertise ebgp link-bandwidth disable command on the local device for the peer.\nPrecautions\nBefore running the peer advertise ebgp link-bandwidth command, you need to use a route-filter to add the Link Bandwidth extended community attribute to BGP routes.\nCurrently, this command can be used to process only one Link Bandwidth extended community attribute per BGP route.\nHowever, if a device changes the next-hop address of a received route carrying the Link Bandwidth extended community attribute to its own address, the device deletes this attribute before advertising it to other peers."
