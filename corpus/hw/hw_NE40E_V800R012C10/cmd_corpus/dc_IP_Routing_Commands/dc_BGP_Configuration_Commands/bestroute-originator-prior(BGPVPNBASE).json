    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a BGP network, after a device receives multiple routes with the same prefix but different paths from different peers, the router needs to select an optimal route from these routes to forward packets. By default, Cluster_List takes precedence over Router ID during BGP route selection. To enable Router ID to take precedence over Cluster_List during BGP route selection, run the bestroute routerid-prior-clusterlist command.\nPrecautions\nIf each route carries an Originator_ID, the Originator_IDs rather than router IDs are compared during route selection. The route with the smallest Originator_ID is preferred. Therefore, after the bestroute routerid-prior-clusterlist command is run, the Originator_ID takes precedence over the Cluster-List during BGP optimal route selection."
