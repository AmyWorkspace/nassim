    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDefault routes are usually used in a network with the following characteristics:\nEach device has multiple EBGP peers and receives full Internet routes from each EBGP peer.There are multiple RRs, and each RR receives full Internet routes.\nIf load balancing is not performed on the network, a BGP peer receives at most one copy of active full Internet routes. If load balancing is performed on the network, the number of active routes received by a BGP peer is doubled, which causes the number of routes on the network to sharply increase. On such a network, you can configure a BGP device to advertise only default routes to its BGP peer and use default routes for traffic load balancing, which can greatly reduce the number of routes on the network.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen this command is run, the default route with the next hop as the local device is unconditionally sent to its peer regardless of whether default routes exist in the routing table.\nPrecautions\nTo configure 6PE, specify the address of the peer as an IPv4 unicast address in the IPv6 unicast address family view."
