    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer label-route-capability command is applicable to the scenario where labeled IPv4 routes need to be exchanged between the local end and the specified peer.\nConfiguring the check-tunnel-reachable parameter can only be used to check tunnels on IPv4 public networks.\nPrerequisites\nThe peer as-number command has been run to create a peer.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer label-route-capability command is run multiple times, the latest configuration overwrites the previous one.\nPrecautions\nWhen the capability of sending labeled routes is enabled or disabled, BGP connection is automatically closed and the capability of the neighbor is re-negotiated, and then the BGP connection is automatically established."
