    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a route-filter is created, you can run the peer route-filter import command to use the route-filter to filter the routes to be received from a specified BGP peer. The command configuration ensures that only desired routes are accepted, which helps manage routes and reduces the routing table size and system resource consumption.\nPrerequisites\nThe route-filter paragraph editing interface view has been displayed and a route-filter has been created using the edit xpl route-filter command.\nPrecautions\nThe peer route-filter command is mutually exclusive with the peer as-path-filter, peer filter-policy, peer ip-prefix, peer route-policy commands.\nIf a peer is specified when the peer route-filter command is run, a peer group is specified when the peer capability-advertise orf command is run, and then the peer is added to the peer group, the peer cannot inherit the configuration of the peer capability-advertise orf command from the peer group."
