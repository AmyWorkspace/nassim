    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe dynamic BGP peer function enables BGP to listen for BGP connection requests from a specified network segment, dynamically establish BGP peer relationships, and add these peers to the same dynamic peer group. This spares you from adding or deleting BGP peer configurations in response to each change in dynamic peers. To configure a maximum number for dynamic BGP peer sessions, run the bgp dynamic-session-limit command.\nPrecautions\nIf you run the command to reduce the maximum number of dynamic BGP peer sessions, the established dynamic peers are not disconnected. For example, the current max-num is 50, and 50 dynamic peers have been established. Then, max-num is changed to 20. In this case, the 50 dynamic peers are not disconnected.\nIf the bgp dynamic-session-limit command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
