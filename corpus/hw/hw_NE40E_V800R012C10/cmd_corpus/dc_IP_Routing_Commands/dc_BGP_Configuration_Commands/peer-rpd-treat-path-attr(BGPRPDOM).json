    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA BGP Update message contains various path attributes. If a local device receives Update messages containing malformed path attributes, the involved BGP sessions may flap. To enhance reliability, run the peer path-attribute-treat command to configure a special mode in which a device processes specified path attributes in received BGP Update messages. Special modes indicate those that are not defined in the standard protocol and include the following:\ndiscard: discards specified path attributes.withdraw: withdraws BGP routes with specified path attributes.treat-as-unknown: performs unknown processing on specified path attributes.\n\nPrecautions\nThis command may cause the specified path attributes to be discarded or routes carrying the path attributes to be withdrawn. Therefore, exercise caution when you run this command.\nThe command configuration takes effect immediately for the routes received after the command is run. However, for the routes received before the command is run, the configuration can take effect only after the refresh bgp command is run."
