    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBMP is used to monitor BGP running status of devices in real time, such as the establishment and termination status of BGP peer relationships and route update status. To allow the BGP running status of a specified BGP peer in the public network address family to be monitored, run the monitor peer command. After a TCP connection is established between the device and the monitoring server, the device reports BGP running status to the monitoring server, improving network monitoring efficiency.\nFollow-up Procedure\nPerform either of the following operations as required:\nRun the route-mode { { { ipv4-family | ipv6-family } unicast } | ipv4-family labeled-unicast | ipv4-family vpnv4 | ipv6-family vpnv6 } adj-rib-in { pre-policy | post-policy } command to set the type of RIB-in route (received from a specified peer in a specified public network address family) whose statistics are to be sent by the device to the monitoring server.Run the route-mode { { { ipv4-family | ipv6-family } unicast } | ipv4-family labeled-unicast | ipv4-family vpnv4 | ipv6-family vpnv6 } adj-rib-out { pre-policy | post-policy } command to set the type of RIB-out route (to be advertised or already advertised to a specified peer in a specified public network address family) whose statistics are to be sent by the device to the monitoring server."
