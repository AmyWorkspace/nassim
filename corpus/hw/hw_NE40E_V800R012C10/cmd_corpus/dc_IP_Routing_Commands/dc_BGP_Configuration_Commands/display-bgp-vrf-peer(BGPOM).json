    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe display bgp peer verbose command displays BGP peer detailed information. You can implement the following operations based on the command output:\nTo check the status of BGP connectionsTo check information about a BGP peerTo check whether a BGP peer is configured using the peer as-number commandTo check whether a BGP peer is deleted using the undo peer as-number command\nThe display bgp labeled peer verbose command displays detailed information about BGP peers in a labeled-unicast sub-address family.\n\nPrecautions\nBGP has multiple address and sub-address families. By default, the display bgp peer command displays information about BGP peers in IPv4 unicast address family only. If you want to view information about BGP peers in another address family, specify its address family parameter.\nTo view detailed information about a BGP peer, such as information about BGP timers, the number of sent and received routes, capacities supported, the number of sent and received BGP messages, and enabled functions, specify verbose in the command."
