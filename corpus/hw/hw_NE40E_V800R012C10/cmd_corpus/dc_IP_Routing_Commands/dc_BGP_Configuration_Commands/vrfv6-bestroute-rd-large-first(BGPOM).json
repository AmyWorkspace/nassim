    "ExtraInfo": "By default, a BGP route with the smallest RD is preferentially selected. In an earlier version, a BGP route with the largest RD is preferentially selected by default. In the current version, however, a BGP route with the smallest RD is preferentially selected by default. If a device is upgraded from the earlier version to the current version, the RD-based BGP route selection rule is changed, and the selected route is different. To prevent this issue, run the bestroute rd-large-first command to configure the BGP device to preferentially select the route with the largest RD."
