    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the inbound traffic optimization scenario, a traffic optimization policy needs to be delivered only to a specific forwarder. If the controller is connected to all forwarders, the traffic control policy can be delivered only to the target forwarder. To reduce the number of connections, the RR connection mode is used. However, if a large number of RPD routes are accepted, a large number of policy nodes are generated accordingly, which reduces the performance. To prevent this problem, non-RRs need to be configured to filter received RPD routes so that undesired traffic optimization policies are discarded. Specifically, if router ID-based filtering is configured on non-RRs, the non-RRs match the Extcommunity in the format of an IP address carried in RPD routes against the router ID of the local BGP process. If the IP address in a route does not match the router ID of the local BGP process, the route is discarded."
