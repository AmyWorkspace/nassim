    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, when EBGP receives the same VPN ORF route from multiple peers, EBGP selects one of the identical VPN ORF routes with the same prefix as the preferred route. EBGP advertises VPN routes matching VPN ORF only to the preferred peer. As a result, fast reroute (FRR) and load balancing cannot be implemented.\nTo address this problem, set the maximum number of EBGP peers to which VPN routes that match a VPN-Target are advertised to 2 or a larger value using the external-path command."
