    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a device supports GR but a BGP peer specified on the device does not support GR, you can run the peer local-graceful-restart timer wait-for-rib command to set the maximum duration for the device to wait for the End-of-RIB flag from the peer. After the BGP session between the device and the peer is reestablished, if the device does not receive the End-of-RIB flag within the specified duration, the BGP session on the device exits from the GR process and the device selects the optimal route among reachable routes."
