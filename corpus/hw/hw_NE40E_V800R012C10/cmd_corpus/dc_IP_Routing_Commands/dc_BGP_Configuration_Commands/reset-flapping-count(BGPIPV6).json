    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBGP peer flapping affects the stability of a BGP network and BGP route convergence.\nThe reset bgp flapping-count command can be used to clear the flapping account of a BGP peer. This allows the Router to re-collect the flapping statistics of a peer to locate BGP network problems.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the reset bgp flapping-count command is run, the flapping statistics of BGP peers are reset and cannot be displayed.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the reset bgp flapping-count command is used to clear the statistics count of a specified BGP peer, run the display bgp peer command to display the flapping count of BGP peers and locate BGP network problems."
