    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure the aging time of validation information and the interval at which validation information is updated, run the timer command. You can configure the two timers to achieve the desired level of BGP security. If stronger BGP security is desired, configure a small value for each timer. Note that frequent validation information updates will lead to higher bandwidth resource consumption."
