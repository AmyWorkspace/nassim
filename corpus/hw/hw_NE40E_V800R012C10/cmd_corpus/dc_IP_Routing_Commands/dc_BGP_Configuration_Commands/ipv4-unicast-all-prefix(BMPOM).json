    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, BMP does not report the trace data of BGP routes on a device. As a result, you can only manually query the trace data of the device's BGP routes.\nTo resolve this issue, run the trace-prefix all command on the device after a connection is established between the device and BMP server. The command configures BMP to monitor the trace data of all IPv4 public network unicast routes in real time. After the configuration, BMP can monitor how the routes are processed in response to the following main items:\nImport route-policy for routes received from a specified peer (configured using the peer route-policy import command)Export route-policy for routes to be advertised to a specified peer (configured using the peer route-policy export command)Export route-policy for BGP VPN routes (configured using the export route-policy command)Import route-policy for BGP VPN routes (configured using the import route-policy command)Route-policy for routes imported using the network commandRoute-policy for summary routesRoute withdrawal"
