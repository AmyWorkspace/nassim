    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAttackers can steal user data by advertising routes that are more specific than those advertised by carriers. Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) can address this issue by validating the origin ASs of BGP routes and apply the BGP origin AS validation result to route selection. To apply the BGP origin AS validation result to route selection, run the bestroute origin-as-validation command.\nThe validation result can be Valid, Not Found, or Invalid. BGP selects routes in the order of Valid, Not Found, and Invalid. If allow-invalid is not specified in the command, BGP ignores the routes with validation result Invalid during route selection.\nPrerequisites\nBGP origin AS validation has been enabled using the prefix origin-validation enable command."
