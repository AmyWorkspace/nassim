    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn some networks, if the clients of an RR establish full-mesh connections with each other, they can directly exchange routing information. Route reflection among clients through the RR is unnecessary. The undo reflect between-clients command can be used to prohibit the clients from reflecting routes to each other to reduce costs.\nPrerequisites\nAn RR has been configured.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the undo reflect between-clients command is run, the clients of an RR are prohibited from reflecting routes.\nPrecautions\nThe reflect between-clients command is run only on RRs."
