    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a device to advertise the Large-Community attribute to its BGP peer group, run the peer advertise-large-community command. If the Large-Community attribute is advertised to a peer group, all the peer members in the group inherit this configuration. This simplifies the application of route-policies and facilitates route maintenance and management.\nPrerequisites\nSpecific Large-Community values have been defined in a route-policy.\nPrecautions\nTo configure a 6PE device to send labeled routes, specify an IPv4 unicast address for the peer of the device in the IPv6 unicast address family view."
