    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn VPN ORF scenarios, if VPNv4 and VPNv6 routes are exchanged and the RT filter is enabled in the BGP-VPN-Target address family view, BGP filters the VPNv4 and VPNv6 routes to be sent to peers based on the import route targets (IRTs) of the peers. If the RT filter is disabled, BGP does not filter the VPNv4 and VPNv6 routes to be sent to peers based on the IRTs of the peers.\nIn RR scenarios, only VPN target routes are forwarded, the RT filter does not need to be enabled to filter VPNv4 and VPNv6 routes. If the RT filter is disabled in an RR scenario, BGP forwards VPN target routes directly, without filtering VPNv4 and VPNv6 routes. This reduces the burden of the RR and speeds up VPN route convergence."
