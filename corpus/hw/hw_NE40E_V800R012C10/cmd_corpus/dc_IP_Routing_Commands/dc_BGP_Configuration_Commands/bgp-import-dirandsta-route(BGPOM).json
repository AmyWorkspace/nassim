    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBGP can import routes using the import-route command or network command:\nThe import-route command imports routes of a specified type into the BGP routing table, such as RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, static, or direct routes.The network command imports routes with the specified prefix and mask into the BGP routing table. Compared with the import-route command, the network command imports more specific routes.\nWhen the import-route static command is run, only active static routes are imported.\nIn most cases, the routes imported by BGP can recurse to tunnels. However, in some other cases, if the routes imported by BGP recurse to tunnels, a problem will occur. For example, in a seamless MPLS scenario, if the egress protection function is configured on egress MASGs between which a tunnel exists and a route imported by BGP on one of the MASGs recurses to the tunnel, this MASG then recurses the route to another tunnel of a different type. In this case, traffic is directed to the other MASG, which slows down traffic switchover. As a result, the egress protection function does not take effect. To address this problem, specify non-relay-tunnel to prevent the routes imported by BGP from recursing to tunnels.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the default-route imported command has not been used when you run the import-route command to import routes from other protocols, BGP cannot import default routes.\nPrecautions\nThe import-route route-policy command is mutually exclusive with the import-route route-filter command."
