    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network where VPN BGP LSP service extensions need to be deployed, to create an MPLS-BGP-VPN instance and enter its view, run the mpls bgp vpn-instance command. After entering this view, you can configure a mode in which the egress of a VPN BGP LSP processes TTL values and enable MPLS to dynamically create BGP BFD sessions.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS has been enabled globally using the mpls (system view) command.\nPrecautions\nAfter the undo mpls bgp vpn-instance command is run in the system view, all configurations in the MPLS-BGP-VPN instance view are deleted."
