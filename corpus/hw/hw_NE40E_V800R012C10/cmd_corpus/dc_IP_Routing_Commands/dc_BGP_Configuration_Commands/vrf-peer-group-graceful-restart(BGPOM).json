    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the graceful-restart command is run in the BGP view to enable GR globally on a device, all the device's peer relationships are disconnected, and the device has to renegotiate the GR capability with its peers. You are therefore advised to run the peer capability-advertise graceful-restart command instead to enable GR for peers in a specified group. After the command is run, the device advertises the GR capability to all the peers in the group. This ensures that the device does not delete the routes received from these peers and forwarding entries before the GR time elapses, thereby preventing traffic interruption.\nConfiguration Impact\nEnabling or disabling GR for each peer in a specified group on a device causes the BGP peer relationships to be disconnected and then reestablished."
