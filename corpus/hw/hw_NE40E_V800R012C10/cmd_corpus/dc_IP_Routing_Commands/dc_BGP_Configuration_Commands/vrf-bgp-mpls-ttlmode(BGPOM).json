    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe BGP LSP egress processes the TTL of MPLS packets in either of the following mode:\nUniform mode\nAfter an IP packet reaches the ingress of an LSP, its IP TTL decreases by 1 and is mapped to its MPLS TTL field. The MPLS TTL decreases by 1 at each hop along the LSP. After the packet reaches the egress, the egress reduces the MPLS TTL by 1 and maps the MPLS TTL value to the IP TTL field before forwarding the packet.\nPipe mode\nOn the ingress, the IP TTL in each packet decreases by 1, and the MPLS TTL is a fixed value. Then the MPLS TTL decreases by 1 at each hop along the LSP, and the IP TTL decreases by 1 only on the ingress and egress along the LSP."
