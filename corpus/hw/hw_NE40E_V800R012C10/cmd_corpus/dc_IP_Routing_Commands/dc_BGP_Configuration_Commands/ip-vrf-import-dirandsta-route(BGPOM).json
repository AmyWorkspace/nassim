    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBGP can import routes using the import-route command or network command:\nThe import-route command imports routes of a specified type into the BGP routing table, such as RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, static, or direct routes.The network command imports routes with the specified prefix and mask into the BGP routing table. Compared with the import-route command, the network command imports more specific routes.\nWhen the import-route static command is run, only active static routes are imported.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the default-route imported command has not been used when you run the import-route command to import routes from other protocols, BGP cannot import default routes.\nPrecautions\nThe import-route route-policy command is mutually exclusive with the import-route route-filter command."
