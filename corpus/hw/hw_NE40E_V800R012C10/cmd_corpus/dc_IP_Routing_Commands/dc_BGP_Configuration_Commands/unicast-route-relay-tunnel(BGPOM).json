    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, non-labeled public BGP routes can recurse to outbound interfaces and next hops, but not to LSPs. To allow non-labeled public BGP routes to preferentially recurse to LSPs, run the unicast-route recursive-lookup tunnel command. If no LSPs are available after the command is run, non-labeled public BGP routes recurse to outbound interfaces and next hops.\nIf tunnel-selector is specified in the command, non-labeled public BGP routes recurse to the LSPs that match the specified tunnel policy selector.\nPrecautions\nThe SRv6 TE Policy or SRv6 TE Policy Group of tunnel is not supported in a tunnel selector specified in the command."
