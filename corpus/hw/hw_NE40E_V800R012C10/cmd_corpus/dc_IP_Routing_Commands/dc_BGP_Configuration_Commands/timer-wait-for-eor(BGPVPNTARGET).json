    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a VPN ORF scenario, if a BGP session is being established or re-established, but the local device fails to receive an End-of-RIB message from a BGP peer in the BGP-VPN-Target address family within the period configured using the timer wait-for-eor command, the device does not advertise VPNv4 or VPNv6 routes during this period. If the local device receives such a message within the period or the period expires but the local device fails to receive such a message, the local device advertises VPNv4 and VPNv6 routes immediately."
