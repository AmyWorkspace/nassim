    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn non-RR networking, or RR networking where the BGP next hop is changed, BGP needs to check whether there is an LSP destined for the next hop. If such an LSP is unavailable, BGP needs to establish one. If the default setting is adopted, a labeled BGP IPv4 unicast route may be selected prior to LSP establishment. As a result, services are incorrectly switched before LSP establishment, packet loss may occur, which affects service stability. The bestroute nexthop-resolved tunnel command can be run to allow route selection only after the labeled BGP IPv4 route recurses to an LSP.\nIn RR networking, if a router only transmits routing information and other routes forwards traffic, you can configure labeled BGP IPv6 unicast routes that recurse to IP addresses to participate in route selection. The bestroute nexthop-resolved command is not applied to the unlabeled routes in the IPv6 unicast address family.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe bestroute nexthop-resolved ip command is mutually exclusive with the bestroute nexthop-resolved tunnel command.\nThe bestroute nexthop-resolved tunnel command is mutually exclusive with the bestroute nexthop-resolved tunnel inherit-ip-cost command."
