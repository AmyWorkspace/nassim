    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen receiving multiple routes with the same prefix from different peers, BGP needs to select an optimal route from these routes. To prevent BGP from comparing the router IDs contained in routes when it selects the optimal route, run the bestroute router-id-ignore command.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen selecting the optimal route, BGP does not compare the router IDs and peer IP addresses contained in routes after the bestroute router-id-ignore command is run."
