    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol protects data privacy on the Internet by preventing attackers from eavesdropping on data exchanged between a client and a server. Specifically, to ensure data transmission security on a network, an SSL policy needs to be configured for BMP using the ssl-policy name command to associate BMP with the SSL policy, and the SSL data encryption, identity authentication, and message integrity verification mechanisms need to be used.\nPrerequisites\nAn SSL policy has been created using the ssl policy command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nOnly clients are available for BMP. Therefore, you can directly run the ssl-policy name command without the need to specify an SSL role.\nA BMP SSL policy can be configured only for BMP sessions with IPv4 addresses and does not take effect for sessions with IPv6 addresses."
