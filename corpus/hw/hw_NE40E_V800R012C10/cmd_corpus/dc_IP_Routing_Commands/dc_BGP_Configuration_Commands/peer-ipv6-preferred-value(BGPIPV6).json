    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the peer preferred-value command is run, all the routes learned from the specified peer have the preferred value. If there are multiple routes to the same address prefix, the route with the highest preferred value is preferred.\nPrerequisites\nA BGP peer has been configured. If the peer preferred-value command is used but no BGP peer exists, a message is displayed, indicating that the peer does not exist.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a preferred value is set for the routes that a BGP device learns from a peer group, all members of the peer group inherit the configuration."
