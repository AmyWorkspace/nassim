    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn AIGP administrative domain is a set of ASs in a common administrative domain. The AIGP attribute is an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute. The AIGP attribute enables BGP to select routes based on metrics in an AIGP administrative domain. As a result, all devices in the AIGP administrative domain can use the optimal routes to forward data.\nAfter the peer aigp command is configured, a local device can receive BGP routes carrying the AIGP attribute from BGP peers or peer groups or send such routes to BGP peers or peer groups.\nPrerequisites\nThe peer as-number command has been run to create BGP peers or BGP peer groups.\nPrecautions\nIf a device does not change the next hop of a route to itself, the device must not change the AIGP attribute value of the route.\nBGP allows you to enable the AIGP capability for either a BGP peer or a BGP peer group. If a BGP peer with the AIGP capability joins a BGP peer group that does not have the AIGP capability, the BGP peer still retains the AIGP capability. If a BGP peer without the AIGP capability joins a BGP peer group that has the AIGP capability, the BGP peer inherits the AIGP capability of the BGP peer group. After a BGP peer inherits the AIGP capability of a BGP peer group, you can run the undo peer aigp command to delete the AIGP configuration from the BGP peer."
