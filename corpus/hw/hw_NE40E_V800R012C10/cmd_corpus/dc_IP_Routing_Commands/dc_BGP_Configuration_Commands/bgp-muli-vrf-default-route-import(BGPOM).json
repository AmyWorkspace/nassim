    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo import default routes to the BGP routing table, run the default-route imported command. After a default route of another routing protocol is added to the BGP routing table, packets can be transmitted over the default route when no matched route is available in the routing table, preventing packet loss.\nFollow-up Procedure\nWhen a device needs to advertise default routes to a peer or peer group and no default route exists in the local routing table, run the peer default-route-advertise command.\nIf a router in an HoVPN network needs to send the default route associated with a specified VPN instance to a VPNv4 peer or peer group, run the peer default-originate vpn-instance command.\nPrecautions\nTo import default routes, you need to run both the default-route imported and import-route commands. If you run only the import-route command, default routes cannot be imported. In addition, the default-route imported command is used to import only the default routes that exist in the local routing table."
