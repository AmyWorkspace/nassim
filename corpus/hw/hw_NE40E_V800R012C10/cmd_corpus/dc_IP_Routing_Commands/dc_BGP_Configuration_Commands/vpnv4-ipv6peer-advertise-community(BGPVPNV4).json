    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer advertise-community command is used to configure a device to advertise a community attribute to its peer. If a device advertises a community attribute to its peer group, all the members of the peer group will inherit the configuration. This simplifies the application of routing policies and facilitates route maintenance and management.\nPrerequisites\nA specific community attribute has been defined by in a routing policy.\nPrecautions\nTo configure a 6PE device to send labeled routes, specify an IPv4 unicast address for the peer of the device in the IPv6 unicast address family view."
