    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer listen-only command is used to configure a peer to only listen to connection requests and not to initiatively send connection requests.\nThe peer connect-only command is used to configure a peer to send connection requests but rejects connection requests.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf this command is run multiple times, the latest configuration overwrites the previous one.\nAfter being configured with this command, a peer does not initiate any connection request.\nPrecautions\nThe peer listen-only command can be run at only one end of a peer relationship. If this command is run at both ends of a peer relationship, the ends fail to establish a connection.\nThe peer connect-only command or the peer listen-only command cannot be run on two devices that will establish a peer relationship. Otherwise, no peer relationship can be established between the two devices."
