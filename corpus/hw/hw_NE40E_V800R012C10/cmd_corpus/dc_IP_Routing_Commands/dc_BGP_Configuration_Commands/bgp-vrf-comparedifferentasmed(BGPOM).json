    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe command is used to change BGP route selection rules. If the compare-different-as-med command is run, BGP will compare the MEDs of the routes learned from peers in different ASs. If there are multiple reachable routes to the same destination, BGP prefers the route with the smallest MED.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the compare-different-as-med command is run, the system compares the MEDs in the routes learned from peers in different ASs.\nPrecautions\nDo not run the compare-different-as-med command unless different ASs use the same IGP and route selection mode."
