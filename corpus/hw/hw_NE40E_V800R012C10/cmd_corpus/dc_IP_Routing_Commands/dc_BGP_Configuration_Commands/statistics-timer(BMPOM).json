    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an interval at which the router sends BGP running statistics to a monitoring server, run the statistics-timer command. You can configure the interval based on the network stability requirements. If BGP requires high stability, configure a small interval. However, if the router sends BGP running statistics frequently, a large amount of bandwidth resources will be consumed. Therefore, retaining the default value is recommended."
