    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore performing BGP configurations in an IPv4 address family, you need to run the ipv4-family command in the BGP view to enable the IPv4 address family and enter the address family view. By default, BGP uses the IPv4 unicast address family.\nConfiguration Impact\nTo disable the IPv4 unicast address family, run the undo default ipv4-unicast command.\nPrecautions\nThe undo ipv4-family command cannot delete the BGP-IPv4 unicast address family view.\nIf the undo ipv4-family command is run, the VPN target and IPv4 configurations of the VPN are deleted. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command."
