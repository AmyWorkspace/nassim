    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn update peer-group may consist of multiple BGP peers. If a network problem (congestion for example) occurs and slows down the speed at which the local device advertises routes to a BGP peer in the update peer-group, the speed at which the local device advertises routes to other BGP peers in the update peer-group is affected. To address this problem, run the slow-peer detection command to enable slow peer detection.\nAfter slow peer detection is enabled, the local device calculates the difference between the time taken to send packets to each BGP peer and the shortest time taken to send packets to a BGP peer in the group. If the difference between the time taken to send packets to BGP peer 1 and the shortest time is greater than the threshold, the local device considers BGP peer 1 as a slow peer and removes it from the update peer-group, which prevents this slow peer from affecting route advertisement to other peers in the group."
