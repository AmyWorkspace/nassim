    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRoute dampening is enabled to solve the problem of route instability. In most situations, BGP is applied to complex networks where routes change frequently. Route dampening is then used to suppress unstable routes.\nThe reset bgp dampening command is used to clear dampening information about specified routes on the public network and release specified suppressed routes. If no IP address is specified in the command, dampening information about all routes on the public network is cleared and all suppressed routes are released.\nPrerequisites\nYou can use display bgp routing-table dampened command to view information about suppressed routes.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the reset bgp dampening command is run, suppressed routes are released. If the status of some routes still changes frequently, route flapping may occur. Routing flapping consumes a large number of bandwidth and CPU resources.\nWhen ipv6-address prefix-length is not specified, after you run the reset bgp ipv6 dampening command, IPv6 route dampening information in the whole BGP routing table is cleared."
