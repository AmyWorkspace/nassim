    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn MTU value determines the maximum number of bytes of a packet each time a sender can send without fragmenting the packet. If the size of packets exceeds the MTU supported by a transit node or a receiver, the transit node or receiver fragments the packets or even discards them, aggravating the network transmission load. MTU values must be correctly negotiated between LSRs to allow packets to successfully reach the receiver."
