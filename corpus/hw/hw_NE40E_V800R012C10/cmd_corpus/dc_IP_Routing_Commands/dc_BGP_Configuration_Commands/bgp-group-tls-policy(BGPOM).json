    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol protects data privacy on the Internet by preventing attackers from eavesdropping on data exchanged between a client and a server. Specifically, to ensure data transmission security on a network, an SSL policy needs to be applied to an SSL client or server using the peer ssl-policy name command, and SSL data encryption, identity authentication, and message integrity verification mechanisms need to be used.\nPrerequisites\nAn SSL policy has been created using the ssl policy command, and a peer relationship has been established using the peer as-number command.\nPrecautions\nThe same SSL policy cannot be applied to different SSL roles.\nThe SSL policy configuration for a peer takes precedence over that for a peer group to which the peer belongs.\nSSL/TLS authentication takes effect only when SSL client and server roles are specified, SSL policies are applied to the client and server, and SSL/TLS authentication is enabled on the server (SSL/TLS authentication is not required on the client)."
