    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn remote BGP VPWS connection scenarios, the VPWS signaling mode must be enabled in the L2VPN AD address family view for BGP peers to exchange VPWS routes. To configure the VPWS signaling mode for all peers or peer groups, run the signaling vpws command.\nPrerequisites\nA peer or peer group has been enabled using the peer enable command.\nPrecautions\nThe signaling mode configured using the peer signaling vpws command takes precedence over the signaling mode configured using the signaling vpws command. If no signaling mode is configured for a peer or peer group but the signaling vpws command has been run, the peer or peer group uses the VPWS signaling mode configured using the signaling vpws command."
