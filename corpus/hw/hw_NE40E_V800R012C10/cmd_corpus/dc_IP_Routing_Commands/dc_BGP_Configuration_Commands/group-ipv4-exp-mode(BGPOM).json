    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the inter-AS seamless MPLS or inter-AS seamless MPLS+HVPN networking, each packet arriving at a CORE ASBR or AGG ASBR carries an inner private label, a BGP LSP label, and an outer MPLS tunnel label. The core ASBR and AGG ASBR remove outer MPLS tunnel labels from packets before sending the packets to each other. If the BGP LSP label in a packet carries a QoS priority different from that in the outer MPLS tunnel label in the packet, run the peer exp-mode command on the core ASBR or AGG ASBR to determine whether the BGP LSP label inherits the QoS priority carried in the outer MPLS tunnel label to be removed."
