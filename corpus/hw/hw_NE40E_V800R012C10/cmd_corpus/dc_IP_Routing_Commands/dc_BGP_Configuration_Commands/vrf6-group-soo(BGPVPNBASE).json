    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a L3VPN scenario, if the ASs to which two VPN sites belong use private AS numbers, the AS numbers of the two VPN sites may be the same. As a result, different sites of the same VPN cannot communicate. The peer substitute-as command can be used to enable AS number substitution on PEs to address this problem.\nEnabling AS number substitution will cause another problem. Several CEs at a VPN site may establish EBGP connections with different PEs of a L3VPN backbone network, and a routing protocol has been configured on the CEs. If AS number substitution is enabled on PEs, the AS numbers carried by VPN routes of this site will be replaced on the PEs. As a result, routes advertised from a CE to a PE may be re-advertised to this VPN site after the routes traverse the backbone network, causing a routing loop. The peer soo command can be run on the PEs to address this problem.\nAfter the peer soo command is run on a PE to configure the SoO attribute for a specified CE, the PE adds the attribute to a route sent from the CE and advertises the route to the remote PE. The remote PE checks the SoO attribute of the route before sending it to its attached CE. If the SoO attribute is the same as the local SoO attribute on the remote PE, the remote PE does not send the route to its attached CE, preventing a routing loop in a VPN site.\nPrecautions\nThe peer soo command is used only in the scenarios where PEs and CEs establish EBGP peer relationships."
