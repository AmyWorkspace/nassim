    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a BGP network, a device often receives multiple routes with the same prefix but different paths from different peers. To forward traffic to that prefix address, BGP needs to select an optimal route from these routes. By default, BGP will compare the IGP costs of these routes to their BGP next hops and select a route with the smallest IGP cost.\nThe bestroute igp-metric-ignore command can be run to configure BGP to ignore the IGP costs in route selection.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the bestroute igp-metric-ignore command is run, BGP does not compare the IGP costs of routes to BGP next hops."
