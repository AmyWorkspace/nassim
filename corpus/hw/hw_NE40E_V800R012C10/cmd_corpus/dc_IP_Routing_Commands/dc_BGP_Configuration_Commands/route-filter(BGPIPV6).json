    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo filter the routes to be advertised using a route-filter, run the route-filter export command.\nIf you specify a route protocol in the command, BGP filters only the routes of this protocol before advertising them. If you do not specify any protocol in the command, BGP filters all routes before advertising them.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the route-filter export command with the same route protocol specified is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nThe route-filter export command is mutually exclusive with the filter-policy export command.\nIf the route-filter export command is run, some BGP routes are not added to the IP routing table. Therefore, exercise caution when using the command.\nIf the route-filter import is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nThe route-filter import command is mutually exclusive with the filter-policy import command."
