    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a large number of routes recurse to the same next hop that flaps frequently, the system will be busy processing changes of these routes, which consumes excessive system resources and leads to high CPU usage. To address this problem, configure BGP recursion suppression in case of next hop flapping. If you do not care about whether the system is busy processing route selection and advertisement and the possible high CPU usage, run the nexthop recursive-lookup restrain disable command to disable BGP recursion suppression in case of next hop flapping."
