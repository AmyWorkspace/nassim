    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA BGP supernet route has the same destination address and next hop address or has a destination address that is more detailed than the next hop address. Any route that meets one of the following conditions is a BGP supernet route:\nIf you perform bitwise AND operations on the destination address mask with the destination address and next hop address, respectively, the calculated network addresses are the same, and the destination address mask is greater than or equal to the next hop address mask.If you perform bitwise AND operations on the destination address mask with the destination address and next hop address, respectively, the calculated network addresses are different. However, if you perform bitwise AND operations on the next hop address mask with the destination address and next hop address, respectively, the calculated network addresses are the same.\nBGP supernet routes include labeled BGP supernet routes and unicast BGP supernet routes. Run the supernet label-route advertise disable command to disable the BGP device from advertising labeled BGP supernet routes.\nTo allow a Huawei device to advertise BGP supernet unicast routes that it receives from a connected non-Huawei device to its BGP peers, run the supernet unicast advertise enable command on the Huawei device."
