    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn L3VPNv6 networking, after you run the ip vpn-instance command to create a VPN instance, you can run the ipv6-family command to enable the IPv6 address family for the VPN instance and perform VPN configurations in the address family view if you want to have IPv6 VPN routes advertised and IPv6 VPN data forwarded.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the route-distinguisher command to configure an RD for the IPv6 address family of the VPN instance. VPN configurations can be performed in the IPv6 address family view only after an RD is configured for the IPv6 address family of the VPN instance.\nPrecautions\nAfter the IPv6 address family for a VPN instance is disabled using the undo ipv6-family command, configurations in the IPv6 address family as well as the IPv6 address family-related configurations in the BGP view will be deleted. Therefore, exercise caution when you run this command."
