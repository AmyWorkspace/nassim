    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the destination of received packets is reachable through an IP route, but not through an MPLS LSP, run the unicast-route label pop-go command. After the command is run on a device, the device pops out the labels that are carried in received packets and allocated to non-labeled routes received in the BGP-IPv4 unicast address family and forwards the packets based on the next hop and outbound interface information."
