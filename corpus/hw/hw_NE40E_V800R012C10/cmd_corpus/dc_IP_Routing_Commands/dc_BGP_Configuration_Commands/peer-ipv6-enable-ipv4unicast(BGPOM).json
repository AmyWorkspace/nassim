    ],
    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, only peers in the BGP IPv4 unicast address family are automatically enabled. After the peer as-number command is used in the BGP view, the system automatically runs the peer enable command to enable a peer. In other address family view, however, a peer must be enabled manually.\nThe peer enable command needs to be run in the BGP-IPv4 unicast address family view to enable BGP IPv6 peer.\nConfiguration Impact\nEnabling or disabling a BGP peer in an address family, for example, running the peer enable command or the undo peer enable command in a IPv4 address family, causes teardown and re-establishment of the BGP connection of the peer in other address families."
