    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a route-policy is created, the peer route-policy import command is used to apply a Route-Policy to a peer group so that the routes received from a peer group can be controlled. To be specific, only the necessary routes are received from the peer group. In this manner, route management is implemented, the scale of the routing table is reduced, and fewer network resources are consumed.\nPrerequisites\nIf the command specifies a route-policy that does not exist, use the route-policy command to create the route-policy.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer route-policy command is run for a peer group, all the members of the peer group inherit the configuration.\nThe peer route-policy command is mutually exclusive with the peer route-filter commands.\nBinding a route-policy after a BGP peer relationship is established may cause peer flapping."
