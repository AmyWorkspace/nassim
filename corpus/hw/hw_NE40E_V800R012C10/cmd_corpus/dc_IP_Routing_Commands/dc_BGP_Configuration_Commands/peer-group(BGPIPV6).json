    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a large-scale BGP network, there are a large number of peers and many of them have the same routing policies. To configure these peers, you have to repeatedly use some commands. In such a case, configuring peer groups can simplify configurations. If you intend to perform the same configuration on several peers, create and configure a peer. Then, add the peers to the peer group. The peers will inherit the configurations of the peer group.\nPrecautions\nPeers with different AS numbers can be added to the same peer group. If a peer has an AS number, the peer keeps its own AS number after being added to a peer. If a peer has no AS number but the peer group to which the peer will be added has an AS number, the peer inherits the AS number of the peer group after being added to the peer group.\nThe members of a peer group can be configured with different route receiving and advertising policies.\nThe undo peer group command has the same function with the undo peer command and the undo peer enable command."
