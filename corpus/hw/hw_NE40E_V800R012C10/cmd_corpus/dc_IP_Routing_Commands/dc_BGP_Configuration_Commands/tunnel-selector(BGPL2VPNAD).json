    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an inter-AS BGP VPLS Option B scenario, to apply a tunnel selector to a device, run the tunnel-selector command. Then, the device recurses L2VPN-AD routes to tunnels that are selected based on a tunnel policy applied to the tunnel selector.\nPrerequisites\nA tunnel selector has been created using the tunnel-selector command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nAfter the tunnel selector applied to BGP L2VPN-AD routes is deleted, L2VPN services may be interrupted because the BGP L2VPN-AD routes cannot recurse to tunnels."
