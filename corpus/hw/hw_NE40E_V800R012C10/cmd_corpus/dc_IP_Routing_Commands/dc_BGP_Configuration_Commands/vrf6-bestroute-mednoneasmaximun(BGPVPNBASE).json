    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe bestroute med-none-as-maximum command takes effect during BGP route selection and is used only when no MED is carried by BGP routes. If no MED is carried and the bestroute med-none-as-maximum command is not run, the system cannot select the desired route as the optimal route.\nConfiguration Impact\nDuring BGP route selection, if the bestroute med-none-as-maximum command is run, a route without MED is assigned the maximum MED (4294967295)."
