    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, BMP does not report the trace data of BGP routes on a device. As a result, you can only manually query the trace data of the device's BGP routes.\nTo resolve this issue, run the trace-prefix command on the device after a connection is established between the device and BMP server. The command configures BMP to monitor the trace data of a specified IPv4 public network unicast route in real time. After the configuration, BMP can monitor how the route is processed in response to the following main items:\nImport route-policy for routes received from a specified peer (configured using the peer route-policy import command)Export route-policy for routes to be advertised to a specified peer (configured using the peer route-policy export command)Export route-policy for BGP VPN routes (configured using the export route-policy command)Import route-policy for BGP VPN routes (configured using the import route-policy command)Route-policy for routes imported using the network commandRoute-policy for summary routesRoute withdrawal"
