    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen routes change, the router sends routing updates to notify its peers. If a route changes frequently, the peer route-update-interval command can be used to adjust the interval at which Update packets are sent for changes of this route. This frees the router from sending Update packets for every route change.\nImplementation Procedure\nIf the peer route-update-interval command is used but no peer exists, a message is displayed, indicating that the peer does not exist.\nPrecautions\nIf a route is withdrawn, the router immediately sends an Update message to its peers, regardless of the peer route-update-interval configuration. If a route is added and the interval between the last route addition time and the current route addition time is greater than the interval configured using the peer route-update-interval command, the router immediately sends an Update message to its peers. If a route is added and the interval between the last route addition time and the current route addition time is less than the interval configured using the peer route-update-interval command, the router sends an Update message to its peers only after the configured interval expires."
