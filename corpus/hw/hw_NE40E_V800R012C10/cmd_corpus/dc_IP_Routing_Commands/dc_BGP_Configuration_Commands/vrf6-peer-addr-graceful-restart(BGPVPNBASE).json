    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the graceful-restart command is run in the BGP view to enable GR globally on a device, all the device's peer relationships are disconnected, and the device has to renegotiate the GR capability with its peers. You are therefore advised to run the peer capability-advertise graceful-restart command instead to enable GR for a specified peer. After the command is run, the device advertises the GR capability to the specified peer. This ensures that the device does not delete the routes received from the specified peer and related forwarding entries before the GR time elapses, thereby preventing traffic interruption.\nConfiguration Impact\nEnabling or disabling GR for a specified peer on a device causes the BGP peer relationship to be disconnected and then reestablished."
