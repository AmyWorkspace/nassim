    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe feature indicating whether the number of routes received from all peers in a BGP address family exceeds the upper limit can be restricted by the PAF. With the PAF restriction, if the number of received routes exceeds 80% of the upper limit, a threshold alarm is generated. If the number exceeds the upper limit, a threshold-crossing alarm is generated, and the excess routes are discarded. To enable the local device to continue to receive routes even after the number exceeds the upper limit, run the bgp paf feature off command to disable the PAF restriction for this feature.\nPrecautions\nIf the number of routes on a device has exceeded the upper limit, the discarded routes (those beyond the upper limit) cannot be restored automatically after the PAF restriction is disabled. To address this issue, run the refresh bgp command."
