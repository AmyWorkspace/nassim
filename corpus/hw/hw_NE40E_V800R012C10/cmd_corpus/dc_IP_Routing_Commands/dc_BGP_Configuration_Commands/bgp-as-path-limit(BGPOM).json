    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command is used to restrict the maximum number of AS numbers in the AS_Path attribute only when the AS_Path attribute is reconstructed or summarized routes are generated.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the as-path-limit command is configured, the device checks whether the number of AS numbers in the AS_Path attribute of each received or advertised route exceeds the maximum value. If the number of AS numbers exceeds the maximum value, the Router discards the route. Therefore, if the maximum number of AS numbers in the AS_Path attribute is set too small, routes will be lost."
