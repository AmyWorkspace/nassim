    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo check information about slow BGP IPv6 peers, run the display bgp ipv6 slow-peer command. The information includes the time when a peer began to be identified as a slow peer, the time when a peer last exited from the slow peer state, the number of times a peer has been identified as a slow peer, and the remaining time for a peer to exit from the slow peer state.\nThe\ndisplay bgp ipv6 peer command displays BGP IPv6 peer information. You can implement the following operations based on the command output:\nTo check the status of BGP connectionsTo check information about a BGP peerTo check whether a BGP peer is configured using the peer as-number commandTo check whether a BGP peer is deleted using the undo peer as-number command\nThe display bgp peer command can be used for troubleshooting, with details as follows: If BGP peers are disconnected, specify log-info in the command to check the log information of the specified peer. In the command output, Date/Time indicates the time when the peers were disconnected, and Error Code and Error Subcode indicate the cause of the disconnection."
