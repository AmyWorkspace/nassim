    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe router-id command is used to configure a Router ID for the Router. Each Router ID uniquely identifies one BGP Router in an AS.\nBy configuring automatic Router ID selection for BGP-VPN instance, you can differentiate the configured Router ID of BGP-VPN instance from the BGP Router ID. For more information about the Router ID of a BGP-VPN instance , see the router-id (BGP-VPN Instance IPv4 Address Family View) command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a BGP session has been established in a BGP VPN instance IPv4/IPv6 address family, changing or deleting the configured router ID resets the BGP session. So, confirm the action before you use the router-id command.\nIf router-id is configured in both the BGP VPN instance IPv4 address family view and BGP VPN instance view, it will be displayed in both views. Deleting the configuration from one view will also delete the configuration from the other view."
