    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBGP route summarization is classified as manual route summarization or automatic route summarization. The aggregate command is used to implement manual route summarization, which takes precedence over automatic route summarization. The aggregate ipv4-address { mask | mask-length } command configures BGP to summarize specific routes in the local BGP routing table and then advertise all specific routes as well as the summary route. The generated summary route inherits the Origin attribute from the specific routes if they have the same Origin attribute. If the specific routes have different Origin attributes, the summary route selects one as its own from these Origin attributes in descending order of preference: igp > egp > incomplete. In addition, the summary route carries the atomic-aggregate attribute. Except the Origin and atomic-aggregate attributes, the summary route does not carry any other attributes of the specific routes.\nTo generate a summary route that can be used to detect a routing loop, you can specify the as-set parameter when running the aggregate command. The summary route inherits the attributes such as Origin, AS_Path (used for loop prevention), community, and large-community from the specific routes. The summary route also carries the community attributes of all its original specific routes. If the number of community attributes carried in the specific routes being summarized exceeds 255, route summarization stops, and the routes that fail to participate in summarization are still advertised as specific routes. Exercise caution to use this parameter if a large number of AS_Path lists are involved in route summarization. This is because frequent changes in the specific routes may cause route flapping.\nIf detail-suppressed is specified in the command, the summarized route is advertised, but specific routes are not. The summarized route carries the atomic-aggregate attribute, not the community attributes of specific routes.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf detail-suppressed is configured in the command, the advertisement of specific routes will be suppressed. If suppress-policy is configured in the command, the advertisement of the specific routes that match the policy will be suppressed.\nPrecautions\nIf the undo aggregate command is run, the system will match routes against the configured attribute-policy, origin-policy, suppress-policy, as-set, or detail-suppressed. If no parameter is configured, the system will fail to execute the undo aggregate command.\nAfter a summary route is configured using the aggregate command and the summary route is leaked from the local VPN instance to another VPN instance, the summary route may be selected to guide traffic forwarding due to its high priority. As a result, traffic is dropped. To prevent this issue, plan a proper mask length for the summary route."
