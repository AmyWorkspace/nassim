    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen primary and backup paths exist, packets may get lost after traffic switches back to the primary path from the backup path.\nTo address this problem, run the route-select delay command on PE3 to configure a route selection delay. An appropriate delay ensures that traffic switches back to the primary path after PE1 completes refreshing forwarding entries.\nPrecautions\nIf the route-select delay command is run more than once, the later configuration overrides the previous one. If the route selection delay is reconfigured and the delay timer has started, the newly configured route selection delay will instantly take effect.\nA route selection delay takes effect only on routes received from peers, not on the routes that are imported locally."
