    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, BGP checks the first AS number in the AS_Path that is carried in Update messages sent by EBGP peers. The Update messages are accepted only when the first AS number is the AS where the EBGP peers locate. Otherwise, the Update messages are denied.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the refresh bgp command if you want to check the received routes again.\nPrecautions\nThe check-first-as command is not listed in the configuration file.\nAfter the undo check-first-as command is configured, routing loops may occur. Therefore, exercise caution when running the command."
