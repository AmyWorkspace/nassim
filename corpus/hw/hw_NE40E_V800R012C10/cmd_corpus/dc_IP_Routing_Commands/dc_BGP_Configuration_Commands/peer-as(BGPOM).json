    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer as-number command is used to create a BGP peer.\nPrecautions\nIf a peer does not join any peer group or the peer group to which a peer belongs is not configured with an AS number, deleting the AS number of the peer will reset the peer relationship.\nIf a peer in a peer group is not configured with an AS number, deleting the AS number of the peer group will interrupt the connection on the peer.\nThe AS number for external session group cannot be the same as the local AS number.\nIf you run the undo peer ipv4-address command, all configurations related to the peer are deleted. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command."
