    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer label-route-capability command is applicable to the scenario where labeled IPv4 routes need to be exchanged between the local end and the specified peer.\nConfiguring the check-tunnel-reachable parameter can only be used to check tunnels on IPv4 public networks.\nIf the check-tunnel-reachable parameter is configured, BGP advertises IPv4 unicast routes to peers when routed tunnels are unreachable or advertises labeled routes to peers when routed tunnels are reachable. In VPN scenario, this eliminates the risk of establishing an MP-EBGP peer relationship between PEs over a faulty LSP because this will cause data forwarding failures.If the check-tunnel-reachable parameter is not configured, BGP advertises labeled routes to peers whether the tunnels for imported routes are reachable or not.\nTo disable tunnel reachability checking, run the peer label-route-capability command, not the undo peer label-route-capability command.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe peer as-number command has been run to create a peer.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer label-route-capability command is run multiple times, the latest configuration overwrites the previous one."
