    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe filter-policy export command takes effect on the routes to be advertised by BGP. BGP filters the routes that are imported using the import-route command. After the command is run, only the routes that match the export policy can be added to the local BGP routing table and advertised by BGP.\nThe filter-policy import command is used to filter the routes received by BGP so that BGP adds only desired routes to the BGP routing table.\nIf protocol is specified, only the routes imported from the specified protocol will be filtered. If protocol is not specified, the routes imported from all protocols will be filtered.\nIf rules are configured for a named ACL using the rule command, only the source address range specified by source and the time period specified by time-range are valid.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the filter-policy export command with the same protocol specified is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nIf the filter-policy import command runs more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThe filter-policy export command is mutually exclusive with the route-filter export command.\nThe filter-policy import command is mutually exclusive with the route-filter import command."
