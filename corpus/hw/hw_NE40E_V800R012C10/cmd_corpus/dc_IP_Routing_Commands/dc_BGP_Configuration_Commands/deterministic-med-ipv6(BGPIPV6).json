    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the BGP deterministic-MED function is disabled, routes are compared against each other according to the sequence in which they are received.\nAfter the BGP deterministic-MED function is enabled using the deterministic-med command, BGP groups the routes that are learned from different ASs but are destined for the same network segment based on the leftmost AS number in the AS_Path, selects one optimal route from each group, and then compares the optimal routes of all the groups. This mode of route selection ensures that the sequence in which routes are received is irrelevant to the route selection result.\nFor detailed application of this command, see Configuration Guide > IP Routing > BGP Configuration > BGP Route Selection Rules > Route Attributes > MED."
