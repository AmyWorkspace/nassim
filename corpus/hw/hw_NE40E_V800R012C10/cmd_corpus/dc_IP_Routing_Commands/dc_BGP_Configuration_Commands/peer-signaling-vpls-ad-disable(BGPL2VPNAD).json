    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn BGP VPLS scenarios, configure the signaling mode for peers or peer groups in the L2VPN AD address family view so that peers can advertise routes to each other.\nPrerequisites\nA peer has been created using the peer enable command.\nPrecautions\nThe signaling mode configured for a peer is preferred over that configured for the peer group to which the peer belongs. When a signaling mode is configured for a peer group but not configured for a peer that belongs to the peer group, the peer uses the signaling mode configured for its peer group."
