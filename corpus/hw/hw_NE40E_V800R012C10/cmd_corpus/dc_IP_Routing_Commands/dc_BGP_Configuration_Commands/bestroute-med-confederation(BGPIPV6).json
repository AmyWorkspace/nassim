    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, BGP compares the MED values of only the routes that are learned from peers in the same AS (excluding confederation sub-ASs). To enable BGP to compare MED values of routes in a confederation when selecting the optimal route, run the bestroute med-confederation command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the bestroute med-confederation command is configured, BGP compares MED values only when AS_Path does not contain any external AS (AS that is not in the confederation) numbers.\nFor example, ASs 65000, 65001, 65002, and 65004 belong to the same confederation. Routes to the same destination are listed as follows:\npath1: AS_Path=65000 65004, med=2path2: AS_Path=65001 65004, med=3path3: AS_Path=65002 65004, med=4path4: AS_Path=65003 65004, med=1\nAfter the bestroute med-confederation command is run, the AS_Path attributes of paths 1, 2, and 3 does not contain external AS numbers. Therefore, when selecting routes based on MED values, BGP compares the MED values of paths 1, 2, and 3 only."
