    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a VPN ORF scenario, if a device does not support VPN ORF, you can configure an RR to advertise default VPN ORF routes to a peer group in the BGP-VPN-Target address family view so that the RR establishes a VPN ORF route-based peer relationship with the peer or peer group. In this way, VPN OFR is implemented.\nFor the specific usage scenario of this command, see \"VPN\" -> \"BGP/MPLS IP VPN Configuration\" -> \"Configuring VPN ORF\" in the Configuration Guide."
