    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the device can recurse BGP IPv6 unicast routes to outbound interfaces and next hops, but not to tunnels. To enable the device to recurse BGP IPv6 unicast routes to tunnels, run the unicast-route recursive-lookup tunnel-v4 command. After the command is run, the device preferentially recurses BGP IPv6 unicast routes to tunnels (LSPs, GRE tunnels, or local IFNET tunnels); if no such tunnels are available, the device recurses the BGP IPv6 unicast routes to outbound interfaces and next hops.\nIf tunnel-selector is specified in the command, BGP IPv6 unicast routes recurse to the tunnels that match the specified tunnel selector.\nPrecautions\nIf the unicast-route recursive-lookup tunnel-v4 command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
