    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter this command is run, the two devices that have established a BGP-MVPN peer relationship send ORF routes carrying the import VPN target (IRT) of the local MVPN instance to each other. After a device receives an ORF route, the device matches the export VPN target (ERT) carried in the MVPN routes to be advertised against the IRT in the received ORF route to filter the MVPN routes. This ensures that the remote peer receives only the desired routes, thereby reducing pressure on the remote peer and the network load.\nPrecautions\nThe ipv4-family vpn-target command must also be run. If the vpn-orf enable command is run, but the ipv4-family vpn-target command is not, the BGP speaker does not advertise routes to the peer in the BGP-MVPN address family."
