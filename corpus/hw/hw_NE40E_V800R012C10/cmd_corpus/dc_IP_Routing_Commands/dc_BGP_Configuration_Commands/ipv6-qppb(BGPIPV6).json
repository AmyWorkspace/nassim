    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, BGP IPv6 routes do not carry QoS attributes. Therefore, BGP IPv6 routes do not support traffic statistics collection. To enable the RM module to collect statistics of traffic along BGP IPv6 routes, run the ipv6 qppb command.\nPrerequisites\nThe BGP-IPv6 unicast address family view has been displayed using the ipv6-family unicast command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ipv6 qppb command is run, BGP IPv6 routes carry QoS attributes. The RM module obtains the QoS attributes upon receiving the BGP IPv6 routes and then collects traffic statistics.\nPrecautions\nThe ipv6 qppb and peer route-policy import commands must both be run so that statistics of traffic along BGP IPv6 routes can be collected."
