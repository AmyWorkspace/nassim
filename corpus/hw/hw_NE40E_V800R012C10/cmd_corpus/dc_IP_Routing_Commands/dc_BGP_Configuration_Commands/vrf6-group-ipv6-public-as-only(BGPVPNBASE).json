    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn general, AS numbers range from 1 to 4294967295. The public AS numbers range from 1 to 64511, and 65536 (1.0 in the format of x.y) to 4294967295 (65535.65535 in the format of x.y), and private AS numbers range from 64512 to 65534, and 65535 is reserved for certain circumstances.\nIf the 4-byte private AS number function is enabled using the private-4-byte-as enable command, private AS numbers range from 64512 to 65534 and from 4200000000 to 4294967294 (64086.59904 to 65535.65534 in the format of x.y).\nPublic AS numbers can be used on the Internet. Private AS numbers cannot be advertised to the Internet, and they are used only within ASs. If private AS numbers are advertised to the Internet, a routing loop may occur. After this command is configured, if the AS path attribute contains only private AS numbers, BGP deletes the private AS numbers and then advertises these update routes.\nBGP does not delete private AS numbers in either of the following scenarios if the peer public-as-only command is run, without any parameter following public-as-only specified:\nThe AS_Path attribute of a route carries the AS number of the remote peer. In this case, deleting private AS numbers may lead to a routing loop.The AS_Path attribute carries both public and private AS numbers, which indicates that the route has passed through the public network. In this case, deleting private AS numbers may lead to a traffic forwarding error.\nParameters that are used to delete or replace private AS numbers are described as follows:\nforce: deletes all private AS numbers from the AS_Path attribute except the private AS number of a specified peer group.force replace: replaces the private AS numbers in the AS_Path attribute with the local AS number except the private AS number of a specified peer group.force include-peer-as: deletes all private AS numbers from the AS_Path attribute.force replace include-peer-as: replaces the private AS numbers in the AS_Path attribute with the local AS number. This parameter ensures that the AS_Path attribute length remains unchanged. Therefore, the route selection result is not affected.limited: deletes private AS numbers from the leftmost one to the local or a public AS number except the private AS number of a specified peer group.limited replace: replaces private AS numbers from the leftmost one to the local or a public AS number in the AS_Path attribute with the local AS number except the private AS number of a specified peer group.limited include-peer-as: deletes private AS numbers from the leftmost one to the local or a public AS number. This parameter ensures that all private AS numbers of the local network are deleted.limited replace include-peer-as: replaces private AS numbers from the leftmost one to the local or a public AS number in the AS_Path attribute with the local AS number.\nSelect one of the preceding parameters based on the network topology to prevent routing loops or forwarding errors.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer public-as-only command is run for a peer group, the peers of the peer group inherit the configuration."
