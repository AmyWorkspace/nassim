    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nConfiguring Keychain authentication improves the security of the TCP connection. You must configure Keychain authentication specified for TCP-based applications on both BGP peers. Note that encryption algorithms and passwords configured for the Keychain authentication on both peers must be the same; otherwise, the TCP connection cannot be set up between BGP peers and BGP messages cannot be transmitted.\nPrerequisites\nBefore configuring the BGP Keychain authentication, a Keychain in accordance with the configured keychain-name must be configured first. For keychain configuration details, see the \"Keychain Configuration\" chapter in Configuration Guide - Security.\nPrecautions\nThe peer keychain command and the peer password command are mutually exclusive."
