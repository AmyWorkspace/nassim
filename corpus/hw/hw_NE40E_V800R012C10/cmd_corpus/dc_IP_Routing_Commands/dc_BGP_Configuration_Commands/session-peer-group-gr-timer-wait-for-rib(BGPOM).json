    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the maximum duration for a device to wait for the End-of-RIB flag from each peer in a specified group, run the peer graceful-restart timer wait-for-rib command on the device. After the BGP session between the device and a peer in the group is reestablished, if the device does not receive the End-of-RIB flag within the specified duration, the BGP session on the device exits from the GR process and the device selects the optimal route among reachable routes.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer graceful-restart timer wait-for-rib command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
