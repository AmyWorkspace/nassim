    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn general, AS numbers range from 1 to 4294967295. The public AS numbers range from 1 to 64511, and 65536 (1.0 in the format of x.y) to 4294967295 (65535.65535 in the format of x.y), and private AS numbers range from 64512 to 65534, and 65535 is reserved for certain circumstances.\nIf the 4-byte private AS number function is enabled using the private-4-byte-as enable command, private AS numbers range from 64512 to 65534 and from 4200000000 to 4294967294 (64086.59904 to 65535.65534 in the format of x.y).\nPublic AS numbers can be used on the Internet. Private AS numbers cannot be advertised to the Internet, and they are used only within ASs. If private AS numbers are advertised to the Internet, a routing loop may occur. After this command is configured, if the AS path attribute contains only private AS numbers, BGP deletes the private AS numbers and then advertises these update routes.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer public-as-only command is run for a peer group, the peers of the peer group inherit the configuration."
