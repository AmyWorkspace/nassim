    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBGP AD VPLS shares a TCP connection with BGP. Most BGP AD VPLS configurations are the same as BGP configurations. Unlike BGP, BGP AD VPLS requires the exchange of VPLS member information between BGP peers. Therefore, BGP peers need to be enabled to exchange VPLS member information in the BGP L2VPN AD address family view.\nThe L2VPN AD address family view is displayed after the l2vpn-ad-family command is run.\nAfter the BGP L2VPN AD address family view is displayed, BGP peers need to be enabled to exchange VPLS member information.\nPrerequisites\nBGP peers have been configured in the BGP view, and basic BGP functions have been configured on the peers.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the peer enable command in the L2VPN AD address family view to enable the exchange of VPLS member information."
