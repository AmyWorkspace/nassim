    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe next hops of BGP routes may not be directly reachable. In this case, recursion is required so that the BGP routes can be used for traffic forwarding. To enable BGP route recursion to the default route in a BGP-VPN instance IPv4 address family view, run the nexthop recursive-lookup default-route command.\nPrecautions\nAfter the nexthop recursive-lookup default-route command is run, BGP routes can recurse to the default route, which may lead to a forwarding path change."
