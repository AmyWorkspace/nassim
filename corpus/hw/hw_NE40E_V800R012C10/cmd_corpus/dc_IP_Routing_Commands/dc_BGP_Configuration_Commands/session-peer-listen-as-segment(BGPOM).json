    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo specify a peer AS range from which a dynamic EBGP peer group listens for BGP connection requests, run the peer listen-as-segment command. The dynamic BGP peer function enables BGP to listen for BGP connection requests from a specified network segment, dynamically establish BGP peer relationships, and add these peers to the same dynamic peer group. This spares you from adding or deleting BGP peer configurations in response to each change in BGP peers.\nPrecautions\nIf the undo peer listen-as-segment command is run, all connections established between the local device and the dynamic peers in the specified AS-Segment are also deleted. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command.\nWhen you run the undo peer listen-as-segment command, ensure that the start and end AS numbers in the AS range to be deleted are the same as those in the configured AS range."
