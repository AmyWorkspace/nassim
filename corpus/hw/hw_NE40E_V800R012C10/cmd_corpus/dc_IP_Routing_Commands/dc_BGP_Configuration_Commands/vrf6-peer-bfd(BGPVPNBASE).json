    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBFD provides millisecond-level fault detection. It helps BGP to detect faults in neighboring devices or links more quickly, and instructs BGP to recalculate routes for correct packet forwarding. The peer bfd command can be used to set the values of BFD session parameters on a specified interface.\nThe BFD configuration of a peer takes precedence over that of the peer group to which the peer belongs. If BFD is not configured on a peer and the peer group to which the peer belongs is enabled with BFD, the peer will inherit the BFD configurations of the peer group.\nPrerequisites\nA BFD session can be established only when the corresponding BGP session is in the Established state.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer bfd command is run multiple times, the latest configuration overwrites the previous one. The BFD session uses the latest parameters as the detection parameters.\nAssume that BFD is configured on a peer. If the peer bfd block command is not run on members of the peer group, the members will establish BFD sessions.\nPrecautions\nIf BFD parameters are set on a peer, a BFD session will be established by using the BFD parameters on the peer."
