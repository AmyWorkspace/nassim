    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a device and a BGP peer specified on the device both support GR, you can run the peer graceful-restart timer wait-for-rib command to set the maximum duration for the device to wait for the End-of-RIB flag from the peer. After the BGP session between the device and the peer is reestablished, if the device does not receive the End-of-RIB flag within the specified duration, the BGP session on the device exits from the GR process and the device selects the optimal route among reachable routes.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer graceful-restart timer wait-for-rib command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
