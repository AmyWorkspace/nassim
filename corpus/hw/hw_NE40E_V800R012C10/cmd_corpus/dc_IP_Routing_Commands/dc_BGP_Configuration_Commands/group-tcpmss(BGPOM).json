    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run the peer tcp-mss command to configure a TCP MSS value used for TCP connection establishment so that it is used to encapsulate BGP packets when the path MTU is unavailable. Such configuration improves network performance.\nPrecautions\nIf you change the tcp-mss-number value, the TCP connection will be re-established.\nIf both the peer tcp-mss and peer path-mtu auto-discovery commands are run, note the following rules:\nIf the local device obtains the path MTU, the smaller value of TCP MSS and path MTU takes effect.If the local device fails to obtain the path MTU, TCP MSS takes effect."
