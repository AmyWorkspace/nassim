    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol protects data privacy on the Internet by preventing attackers from eavesdropping on data exchanged between a client and a server. The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is an SSL successor and ensures data integrity and privacy. To enable SSL/TLS authentication on an SSL server, run the peer ssl-server certificate command. BGP messages are then encrypted to ensure data transmission security on the network.\nPrerequisites\nA BGP peer relationship has been established using the peer as-number command.\nPrecautions\nSSL/TLS authentication can be enabled only on servers.\nThe SSL/TLS authentication configuration for a peer takes precedence over that for a peer group to which the peer belongs.\nSSL/TLS authentication takes effect only when SSL client and server roles are specified, SSL policies are applied to the client and server, and SSL/TLS authentication is enabled on the server (SSL/TLS authentication is not required on the client)."
