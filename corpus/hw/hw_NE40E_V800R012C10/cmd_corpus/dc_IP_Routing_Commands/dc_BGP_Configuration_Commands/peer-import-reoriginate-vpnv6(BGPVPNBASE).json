    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the data center interconnect (DCI) solution, DCI-PE adds the regeneration flag to the received VPNv6 routes before sending the routes to the peer. By default, the function to add the regeneration flag to the routes received from the peer is disabled. Specifically, DCI-PE does not re-encapsulate the routes received from the peer. Therefore, to allow DCI-PE to re-encapsulate the VPNv6 routes, run the peer import reoriginate command to enable the function to add the regeneration flag to the routes received from the peer.\nPrerequisites\nRoute exchange with a specified peer has been enabled using the peer peer-address enable command."
