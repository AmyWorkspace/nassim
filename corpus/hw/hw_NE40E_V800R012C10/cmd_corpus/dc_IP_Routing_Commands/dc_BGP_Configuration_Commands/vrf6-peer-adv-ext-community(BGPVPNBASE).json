    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer advertise-ext-community command is used to enable a device to advertise an extended community attribute to a specified peer. If a device advertises an extended community attribute to a specified peer group, all the members of the peer group will inherit the configuration. This simplifies the application of routing policies and facilitates route maintenance and management.\nPrerequisites\nA specific extended community attribute has been defined in a routing policy."
