    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, a device supports 2-byte private AS numbers instead of 4-byte private AS numbers. The 2-byte private AS numbers range from 64512 to 65534, and 65535 is reserved for certain circumstances. If the private-4-byte-as enable command is run, the device supports both 2-byte and 4-byte private AS numbers, and 4-byte private AS numbers range from 4200000000 to 4294967294 (64086.59904 to 65535.65534 in the format of x.y). In this case, private AS numbers ranging from 64512 to 65534 or from 4200000000 to 4294967294 are used only within the AS, not advertised to the Internet, which prevents routing loops."
