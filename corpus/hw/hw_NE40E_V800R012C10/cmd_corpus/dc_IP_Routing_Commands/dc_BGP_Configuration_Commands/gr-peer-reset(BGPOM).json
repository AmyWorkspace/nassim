    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCurrently, BGP does not support dynamic capability negotiation. As a result, each time the BGP capability changes, the BGP peer relationship is re-established. For example, a BGP IPv4 unicast peer relationship is established and IPv4 services are running; if the BGP capability changes, the BGP IPv4 unicast peer relationship will be re-established, which interrupts ongoing IPv4 services. To prevent the service interruptions, run the graceful-restart peer-reset command to enable the router to reset a BGP session in GR mode.\nIf the GR reset function and a new BGP capability are enabled on a BGP speaker, the BGP speaker enters the GR state, resets the BGP session (without deleting the routing entries for the session), and renegotiates BGP capabilities with its peer. Therefore, existing services are not interrupted.\nEnable the device to reset a BGP connection in GR mode when establishing BGP peer relationships."
