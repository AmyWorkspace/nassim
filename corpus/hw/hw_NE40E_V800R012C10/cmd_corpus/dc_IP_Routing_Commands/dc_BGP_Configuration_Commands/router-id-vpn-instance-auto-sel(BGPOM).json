    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe router-id command is used to configure a Router ID for the Router. Each Router ID uniquely identifies one BGP Router in an AS.\nBy configuring automatic Router ID selection for BGP-VPN instance, you can differentiate the configured Router ID of BGP-VPN instance from the BGP Router ID. If a Router ID is manually specified for a BGP-VPN instance, the manually specified Router ID takes precedence over the automatically selected Router ID. For more information about the Router ID of a BGP-VPN instance , see the router-id (BGP-VPN Instance IPv4 Address Family View) command.\nPrerequisites\nThe bgp command is run to enable BGP.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a BGP session has been established in a BGP-VPN instance , deleting the configured Router ID resets the BGP session.Exercise caution when changing or deleting a Router ID.\nPrecautions\nBy default, the Router that is not configured with any interface uses the Router ID of 0.0.0.0 assigned by routing management."
