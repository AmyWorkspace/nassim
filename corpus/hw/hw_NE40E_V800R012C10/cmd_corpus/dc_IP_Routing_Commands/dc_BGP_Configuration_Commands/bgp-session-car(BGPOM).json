    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe BGP whitelist session CAR function is enabled by default. It isolates message channels between BGP sessions.\nTo disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car bgp disable command. BGP messages received by this device will then be sent directly through the BGP-specific CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of BGP messages, messages from different BGP sessions may preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not usually recommended.\nPrecautions\nIf the BGP whitelist session CAR function encounters an exception, you are advised to disable this function. In normal situations, enabling this function is recommended."
