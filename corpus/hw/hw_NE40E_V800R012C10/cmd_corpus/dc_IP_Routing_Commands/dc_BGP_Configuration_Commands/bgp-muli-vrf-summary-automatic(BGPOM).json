    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe summary automatic command is used in the BGP-IPv4 unicast address family view to configure a BGP device to automatically aggregate locally-imported routes on the public network.\nThe summary automatic command is used in the BGP-VPN instance view to configure a BGP device to automatically aggregate locally-imported routes on a private network.\nThe summary automatic command is used to aggregate the routes imported by BGP. These routes can be direct routes, static routes, RIP routes, OSPF routes, or IS-IS routes. After this command is run on a BGP device, the BGP device aggregates routes based on the natural network segment (for example, 10.1.1.1/32 and 10.2.1.1/32 are aggregated to 10.0.0.0/8, a class A address), and sends only the aggregated route to its peers. This reduces the number of routes.\nConfiguration Impact\nBGP route aggregation is classified into manual aggregation and automatic aggregation. The command is used to implement automatic aggregation. Manual aggregation takes precedence over automatic aggregation.\nPrecautions\nThe summary automatic command is invalid for the routes imported by using the network command."
