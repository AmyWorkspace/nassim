    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the controller notifies an RPD route update, protocols delay applying the updated route-policy for 30s by default. To speed up or slow down the response of protocols to RPD route changes, run the rpd-policy change notify-delay command to set a delay as required so that the updated route-policy is applied after the delay.\nPrecautions\nIf an RPD route-policy is updated during the delay, protocols do not reset the timer. Instead, they apply the most updated route-policy when the ongoing timer expires."
