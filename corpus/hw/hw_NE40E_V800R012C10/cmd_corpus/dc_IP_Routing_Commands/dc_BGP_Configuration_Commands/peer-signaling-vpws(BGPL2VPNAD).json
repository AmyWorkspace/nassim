    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn remote BGP VPWS connection scenarios, the VPWS signaling mode must be enabled in the L2VPN AD address family view for BGP peers to exchange VPWS routes. To configure the VPWS signaling mode for a specified peer, run the peer signaling vpws command.\nPrerequisites\nA peer has been enabled using the peer enable command.\nPrecautions\nThe signaling mode configured for a peer takes precedence over the signaling mode configured for the peer group to which the peer belongs. If no signaling mode is configured for a peer but a signaling mode is configured for the peer group to which the peer belongs, the peer uses the signaling mode configured for the peer group."
