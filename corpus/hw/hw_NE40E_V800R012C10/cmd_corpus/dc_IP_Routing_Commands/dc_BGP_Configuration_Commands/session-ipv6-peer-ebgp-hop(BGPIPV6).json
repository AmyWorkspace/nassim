If the specified maximum number of hops is 1, EBGP connection cannot be established between non-directly connected devices. If hop-count is not specified in the peer ebgp-max-hop command, 255 is used as the maximum number of hops in EBGP connections."

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA directly-connected physical link must be available between EBGP peers. Otherwise, the peer ebgp-max-hop command must be used to allow EBGP peers to establish a TCP connection over multiple hops.\nIf loopback interfaces are used to establish an EBGP peer relationship, the peer ebgp-max-hop command (max-hop-value >= 2) must be run; otherwise, the peer relationship cannot be established.\nPrecautions\nIf the peer ebgp-max-hop command is used on one end of an EBGP connection, it must also be used on the other end.\nThe configurations of GTSM and EBGP-MAX-HOP affect the TTL values of sent BGP packets, and the configurations of the two functions are mutually exclusive."
