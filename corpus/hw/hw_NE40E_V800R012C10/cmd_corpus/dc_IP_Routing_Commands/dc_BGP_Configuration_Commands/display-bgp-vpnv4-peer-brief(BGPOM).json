In the command output, Date/Time indicates the time when the peers were disconnected, and Error Code and Error Subcode indicate the cause of the disconnection.\nTo check information about slow BGP peers, run the display bgp slow-peer command. The information includes the time when a peer began to be identified as a slow peer, the time when a peer last exited from the slow peer state, the number of times a peer has been identified as a slow peer, and the remaining time for a peer to exit from the slow peer state."
