    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a BGP device to advertise Best-external routes to non-client IBGP peers, run the peer advertise best-external command. Best-external routes cannot be advertised to EBGP peers or clients.\nPrerequisites\nThe BGP device has been enabled to select Best-external routes if the route preferentially selected based on the policies for BGP route selection is an IBGP route using the bestroute best-external command.\nPrecautions\nThe peer advertise best-external and peer reflect-client commands are mutually exclusive.\nIf a peer is specified when the peer advertise best-external command is run, a peer group is specified when the peer advertise add-path, peer capability-advertise add-path, or peer reflect-client command is run, and then the peer is added to the peer group, the peer cannot inherit the configuration of the peer advertise add-path, peer capability-advertise add-path, or peer reflect-client command from the peer group."
