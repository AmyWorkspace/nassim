    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an inter-AS VPN Option C scenario where an VPNv4 Route Reflector (RR) is used, the peer next-hop-invariable command needs to be run on the RR to prevent the RR from modifying the Next_Hops of routes before advertising the routes to EBGP peers. This ensures that the remote PE recurses routes to the LSP destined for the local PE during traffic transmission.\nPrerequisites\nThe peer as-number command has been used to create a peer group.\nPrecautions\nThe peer next-hop-invariable command takes effect only for received routes. However, the configuration does not take effect for received IPv4 routes that do not carry labels.\nIf a device needs to advertise routes to its IBGP peer group, the peer next-hop-invariable and peer next-hop-local commands are mutually exclusive on the device."
