    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the RPD export route-policy function in an address family, run the peer rpd-policy export enable command. With the function, after the controller delivers an RPD route to the local device, the local device generates a dynamic route-policy based on the route and uses the policy as an export route-policy to filter and modify the routes advertised to the peer specified in the command.\nPrerequisites\nA BGP peer has been configured using the peer as-number command."
