To configure the device to import labeled routes from a specified VPN instance into the public network BGP routing table, run the import-rib vpn-instance labeled-unicast command in the BGP view or BGP-IPv4 unicast address family view.\nPrecautions\nIf the route-policy-name parameter is specified in the import-rib command, the if-match interface command configuration will become ineffective.\nBGP IPv4 route import between instances does not take effect for routes imported between local VPN instances or routes imported in Import or Network mode."
