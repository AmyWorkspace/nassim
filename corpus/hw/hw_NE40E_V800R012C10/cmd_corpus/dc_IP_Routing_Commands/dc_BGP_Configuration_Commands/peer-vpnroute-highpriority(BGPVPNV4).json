    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn networks where IPv4 and IPv6 services coexist, a device may have two routes with the same prefix but different next hops. One is an IPv4 route and the other is an IPv6 route. To enable the device to preferentially select one of the routes based on a higher priority, run the peer high-priority command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe peer high-priority command takes effect only for VPNv4 routes and remotely leaked routes."
