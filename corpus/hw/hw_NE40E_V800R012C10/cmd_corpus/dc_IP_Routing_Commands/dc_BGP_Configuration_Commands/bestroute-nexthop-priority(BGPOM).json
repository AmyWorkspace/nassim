    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn networks where IPv4 and IPv6 services coexist, a device may have two routes with the same prefix but different next hops. One is an IPv4 route and the other is an IPv6 route. To enable the device to preferentially select a route with an IPv4 or IPv6 next hop address, run the bestroute nexthop-priority command."
