    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBGP is an inter-AS dynamic routing protocol. BGP running within an AS is called Internal BGP (IBGP), and BGP running between ASs is called External BGP (EBGP).\nWhether to apply BGP to inter-AS routing information transmission depends on the following conditions:\nIf at least one of the following conditions is met, BGP can be used:\nData packets are allowed to be transmitted from one AS to another.Multiple connections to external ISPs and the Internet exist in ASs.Data flows entering or leaving ASs need to be controlled.If one of the following conditions is met, BGP does not need to be used:Users are connected to only one ISP network.The ISP does not need to provide Internet access services for users.ASs adopt default routes between each other.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the bgp command is run, BGP is enabled.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the peer as-number command to establish BGP peer relationships between devices on a BGP network.\nPrecautions\nEach device runs in only one AS; therefore, each device can be specified with only one local AS number.\nBy default, an AS number must be specified when you run the undo bgp command. If the re-confirmation function is disabled for undo commands using the configuration prevent-misoperation disable command, an AS number is optional when you run the undo bgp command.\nExercise caution when using the undo bgp command because it will delete all BGP configurations from a device."
