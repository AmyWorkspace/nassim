    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a dynamic routing protocol used between autonomous systems (ASs). BGP EPE is a BGP extension to segment routing and is used to implement source routing between ASs.\nBGP EPE allocates BGP peer SIDs to inter-AS paths. BGP-LS advertises the BGP peer SIDs to the network controller. The controller properly orchestrates IGP SIDs and BGP peer SIDs to implement inter-AS optimal path forwarding.\nAfter the peer egress-engineering srv6 command is run, a local device can assign peer node segment (peer-node SID) and peer adjacency segment (peer-Adj SID) values.\nA peer-node SID identifies a node on which a peer is configured.A peer-Adj SID identifies an adjacency to a peer.\n\nPrecautions\nBGP EPE takes effect only after BGP-LS is enabled using the link-state-family unicast command and SRv6 is enabled using the segment-routing ipv6 command.\nIf a locator is specified in the peer egress-engineering srv6 locator command, BGP EPE allocates SIDs from this locator to peers. If no locator is specified in the peer egress-engineering srv6 command, BGP EPE uses the locator specified in the segment-routing ipv6 egress-engineering locator command for allocation.\nA locator and a static SID cannot both be specified when you enable BGP EPE for a specified peer. If both of them are configured, the latter configuration overrides the previous one. If you want to specify a static SID, ensure that the value is in the static SID value range of the locator specified in the segment-routing ipv6 egress-engineering locator command and the SID value must be globally unique."
