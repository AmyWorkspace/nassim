    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter slow peer detection is enabled, the local device calculates the difference between the time taken to send Update messages to each BGP peer and the shortest time taken to send Update messages to a BGP peer in the group. If the difference between the time taken to send Update messages to BGP peer 1 and the shortest time is greater than the specified threshold, the local device considers BGP peer 1 as a slow peer and removes it from the update peer-group. The removal of the slow peer prevents this slow peer from affecting update message advertisement to other peers in the group. If Update messages fail to be advertised, the traditional slow peer detection function cannot be used to detect slow peers. To address this problem, configure an absolute threshold for slow peer detection. If the delay in sending Update messages to a peer is greater than the absolute threshold, the peer is considered a slow peer.\nTo configure an absolute threshold for slow peer detection, run the slow-peer absolute-detection threshold command."
