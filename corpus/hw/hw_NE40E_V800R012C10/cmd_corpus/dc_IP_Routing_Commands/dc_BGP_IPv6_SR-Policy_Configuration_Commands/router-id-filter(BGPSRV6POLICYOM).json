    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn inbound traffic optimization scenarios, traffic optimization policies need to be delivered only to specific devices. If NCE is connected to devices, NCE can directly deliver a traffic optimization policy to the devices. If the RR connection mode is used to reduce the number of required connections, policy-based route filtering needs to be performed on non-RRs to directly discard the traffic optimization policies that are not required by the local device. This prevents the generation of too many policy nodes after a large amount of policy-based routing data is received, guaranteeing performance. With router ID filtering, the local device checks whether the IP address in the Extcommunity carried in the received traffic optimization policy-based route matches the router-id of the local BGP process. If they do not match, the local device discards the route."
