    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEven if you run the graceful-restart timer restart time command in the BGP view, the maximum wait time can be changed to 3600s at most. If some BGP sessions take more than 3600s to re-establish due to poor network conditions, you can run the peer graceful-restart static-timer command to set a proper wait time for a specified peer.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the graceful-restart timer restart command is run in the BGP view and the peer graceful-restart static-timer command is run in any of its views, the latter command takes precedence over the former command.\nPrecautions\nGR has been enabled using the graceful-restart command."
