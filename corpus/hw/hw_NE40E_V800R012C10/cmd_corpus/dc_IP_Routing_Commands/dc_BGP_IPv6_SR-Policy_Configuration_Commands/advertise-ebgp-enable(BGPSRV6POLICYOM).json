    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSRv6 TE Policy is a tunneling technology developed based on SRv6. An SRv6 TE Policy route dynamically generated by a controller needs to be transmitted to a forwarder through BGP extension. By default, SRv6 TE Policy routes are advertised only to IBGP peers. To advertise SRv6 TE Policy routes to EBGP peers, run the advertise ebgp enable command."
