    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSRv6 TE Policy is a tunneling technology developed based on SRv6. An SRv6 TE Policy route dynamically generated by a controller needs to be transmitted to a forwarder through BGP extension. This function is implemented through the newly defined BGP SRv6 TE Policy subsequent address family identifier (SAFI). By establishing a BGP IPv6 SR-MPLS TE Policy address family-specific peer relationship between the controller and forwarder, this function enables the controller to deliver the SRv6 TE Policy route to the forwarder.\nBy default, the forwarder does not advertise the preferentially selected SRv6 TE Policy route to EBGP peers. You can run the advertise ebgp enable command to enable the forwarder to advertise the SRv6 TE Policy route to EBGP peers. After an SRv6 TE Policy is created using the SRv6 TE Policy route, different types of routes, such as EVPN, L2VPN, VPNv4, VPNv6, and public BGP routes, can be recursed to the SRv6 TE Policy.\nBefore you configure the BGP IPv6 SR-MPLS TE Policy address family, run the ipv6-family sr-policy command in the BGP view to enable the address family and enter the address family view."
