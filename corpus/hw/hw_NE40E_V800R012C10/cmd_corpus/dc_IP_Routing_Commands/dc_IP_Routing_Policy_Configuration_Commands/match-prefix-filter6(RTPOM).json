    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe filtering rule (based on the destination addresses, next hop addresses, or source addresses of IPv6 routes) configured using this command takes effect only after an IPv6 prefix or an ACL is configured.\nIf the if-match ipv6 next-hop prefix-list aa command is used but the ip ipv6-prefix aa is not configured, all routes are permitted. This is the same case when the ACL is used.If the if-match ipv6 next-hop prefix-list aa command is used after the ip ipv6-prefix aa permit 2001:db8:1::1 128 command is used, the routes with the next hop address 2001:db8:1::1 are permitted. This is the same case when the ACL is used.\n\nPrerequisites\nA route-policy has been configured using the route-policy command.\nAn IPv6 prefix has been configured using the ip ipv6-prefix command.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen you filter routes based on the destination addresses of IPv6 routes, the routes that match the filtering rule are permitted and the route that do not match the filtering rule are denied."
