    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Large-Community attribute is a private attribute of BGP and can be flexibly applied to route-policies. The ip large-community-filter command works with the if-match large-community-filter command so that a filtering rule based on a specific Large-Community filter can be used to filter BGP routes.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display ip large-community-filter command to view detailed configuration of the Large-Community filter.\nPrecautions\nThe relationship between the rules in a Large-Community filter is \"AND\", which is different from that in an RD filter. This is because each route has only one RD but can have multiple Large-Community values.\nBy default, a Large-Community filter works in deny mode. BGP routes that fail one of the filtering rules do not match the Large-Community filter. If all matching rules in a Large-Community filter work in deny mode, all BGP routes are denied by the filter. To prevent this problem, configure a matching rule in permit mode after one or more matching rules in deny mode so that the routes except for those denied by the preceding filtering rules match the filter."
