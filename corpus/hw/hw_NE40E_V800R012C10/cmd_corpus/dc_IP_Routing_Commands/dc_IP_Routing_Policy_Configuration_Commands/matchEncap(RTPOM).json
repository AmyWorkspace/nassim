    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nExtended community attributes help flexibly control a route-policy. To configure a matching rule based on an encapsulation extended community filter, run the if-match extcommunity-list encapsulation command.\nRun the route-policy command to configure a route-policy or enter the view of an existing route-policy.A route-policy may consist of multiple nodes, and the relationship among these nodes is OR. The system matches routes against the nodes in ascending order of node IDs. If a route matches a node in the route-policy, the route is not matched against the next node.Each node comprises a set of if-match and apply clauses. The if-match clauses define matching rules that are based on route attributes. The relationship among if-match clauses of the same node that are based on different route attributes is AND. Specifically, a route matches a node only when it meets all the if-match clauses of the node. The relationship among if-match clauses of the same node that are based on the same route attribute is OR; the system matches routes against the if-match clauses in order; if a route matches an if-match clause, the route matches the route-policy, and the system no longer matches the route against the rest if-match clauses. For example, the if-match community-filter 1 and if-match as-path-filter 1 configurations in node 10 are based on different route attributes. Therefore, the relationship among if-match clauses of this node is AND. The if-match community-filter 1 and if-match community-filter 2 configurations in node 20 are both based on the community attribute. Therefore, the relationship among if-match clauses of this node is OR. The apply clauses specify actions. If a route matches a node, the apply clauses set route attributes for the route.\nThe if-match extcommunity-list encapsulation command is mainly used to match BGP EVPN routes and requires the ip extcommunity-list encapsulation command to be configured. For example:\nIf the if-match extcommunity-list encapsulation basic aaa command is run but the filter named aaa is not configured, all BGP routes are permitted.If the if-match extcommunity-list encapsulation basic aaa and ip extcommunity-list encapsulation basic aaa permit 0:1 0:2 0:3 commands are run, BGP routes carrying the community attribute 0:1 0:2 0:3 are permitted.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn encapsulation extended community filter has been configured using the ip extcommunity-list encapsulation command."
