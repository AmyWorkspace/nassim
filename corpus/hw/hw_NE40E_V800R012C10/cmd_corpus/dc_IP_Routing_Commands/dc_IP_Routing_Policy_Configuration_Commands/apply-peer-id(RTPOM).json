    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMany attacks are initiated by bogus sources. Therefore, BGP peer-based URPF needs to be deployed on the interfaces connecting the backbone network (including IGWs) and external networks to prevent IP spoofing attacks and reduce bandwidth on the IGWs and backbone network.\nThe apply peer-id command generates a mapping between the peer group ID and the interface for the device to determine whether to discard the received traffic to prevent attacks."
