    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a device enabled to add the entropy label to advertised routes using the peer advertise-entropy-label command, if you want to discard the entropy label in received or advertised BGP routes, run the apply entropy-label none command in an import or export route-policy. Then, the entropy label in the BGP routes that match the if-match clauses will be discarded.\nPrerequisites\nA route-policy has been configured."
