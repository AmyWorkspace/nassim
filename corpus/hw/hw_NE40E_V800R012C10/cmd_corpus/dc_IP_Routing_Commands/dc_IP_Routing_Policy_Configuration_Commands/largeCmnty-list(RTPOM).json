    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Large-Community attribute is a private attribute of BGP and can be flexibly applied to route-policies. To set a BGP Large-Community list, run the ip large-community-list command. The BGP Large-Community list can be used to assign values to the Large-Community attribute in BGP routes.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the large-community command in the Large-Community list view to set values for the Large-Community attribute.\nIf no Large-community attribute is configured in the Large-community attribute list view, the filtering result of the route-policy that references the Large-community attribute list is not as expected."
