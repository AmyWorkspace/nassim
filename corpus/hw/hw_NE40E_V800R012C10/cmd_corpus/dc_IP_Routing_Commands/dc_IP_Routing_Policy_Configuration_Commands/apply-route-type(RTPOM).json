    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen importing routes to IS-IS, you can use the apply isis command to set the level of the routes imported to IS-IS.\nTo import routes to the OSPF backbone area or an NSSA, run the apply ospf command, which prevents too many external routes from being imported into OSPF.\nPrerequisites\nA route-policy has been configured using the route-policy command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter a route matches a route-policy, the level of the route imported to IS-IS is set.\nRoutes matching the if-match clauses defined in the route-policy will be imported into the OSPF area specified in the command."
