    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA VPN-Target extended community filter can be used as a matching condition of a route-policy using a command, such as the if-match extcommunity-filter zz command.\nOnly the extended community number can be specified for a basic VPN-Target extended community filter. The regular expression can be used as a matching rule in an advanced VPN-Target extended community filter.\nThe relationship between the rules of the VPN-Target extended community filter is \"OR\", which is different from that of an RD filter. This is because each route has only one RD but can have multiple communities.\nFor example, a VPN-Target extended community filter can be set in either of the following formats, with the same filtering result:\nFormat 1:\nip extcommunity-filter 1 permit rt 100:1 rt 200:1 rt 300:1\nThe filter has one rule, which consists of three VPN-Targets: 100:1, 200:1, and 300:1. The relationship between them is \"OR.\"\nFormat 2:\nip extcommunity-filter 1 permit rt 100:1\nip extcommunity-filter 1 permit rt 200:1 rt 300:1\nThe filter has two rules. Rule 1 consists of VPN-Target 100:1, and rule 2 consists of VPN-Targets 200:1 and 300:1. The relationship between the two rules is \"OR.\"\nIn format 2, the VPN-Target extended community defined in each rule must be a sub-set of route VPN-Target extended communities so that the rule can be matched.\nThe undo ip extcommunity-filter command deletes a specified VPN-Target extended community filter.\nThe display ip extcommunity-filter command displays detailed configurations of the VPN-Target extended community filter.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe ip extcommunity-filter command filters routes based on the RT attributes of the routes. The routes that match the filtering are permitted to pass through, and the routes that fail to match the filtering are denied.\nPrecautions\nThe extended community attributes of a route include VPN-target and Source of Origin (SoO). The ip extcommunity-filter command adds a VPN-Target extended community filter.\nBy default, VPN-Target extended community filters work in deny mode. If all matching rules in a filter are configured to work in deny mode, all routes are denied by the filter; to prevent this problem, configure one matching rule in permit mode after one or multiple matching rules in deny mode so that the routes except for those denied by preceding matching rules are permitted by the filter."
