    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCommunity attributes are BGP-specific and are used to simplify routing policy application and network maintenance and management. A community is a set of destination addresses with the same characteristics. These addresses have no physical boundary and are independent of their ASs. They share one or multiple community attributes. To create a BGP community list, run the ip community-list command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the community command to configure community attributes for a BGP community list.\nIf no community attribute is configured in the community list view, the filtering results of the route-policy that references the community list are not as expected."
