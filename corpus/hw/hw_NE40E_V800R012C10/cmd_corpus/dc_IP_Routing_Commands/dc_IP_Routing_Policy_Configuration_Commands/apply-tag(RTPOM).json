    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the same tag for the routes that match the filtering conditions specified in the if-match clause, run the apply tag command.\nRun the route-policy command to enter the Route-policy view.A route-policy may consist of multiple nodes. The relationship between the nodes is \"OR\". The system matches a route against the nodes in sequence. If the route matches a node, the route matches the route-policy, and the system no longer matches it against other nodes.Each node comprises a set of if-match and apply clauses. The if-match clauses define the filtering rules that are used to match certain route attributes. The relationship among if-match clauses of the same node that are based on different route attributes is AND. A route matches a node only when the route matches all the filtering rules specified in the if-match clauses of the node. The apply clauses specify actions. The relationship among if-match clauses of the same node that are based on the same route attribute is OR. The system matches routes against the if-match clauses in order. If a route matches an if-match clause, the system no longer matches the route against the rest if-match clauses. For example, the if-match community-filter 1 and if-match as-path-filter 1 configurations in node 10 are based on different route attributes. Therefore, the relationship among if-match clauses of this node is AND. The if-match community-filter 1 and if-match community-filter 2 configurations in node 20 are both based on the community attribute. Therefore, the relationship among if-match clauses of this node is OR. The apply clauses specify actions. If a route matches a node, the apply clauses set some attributes for the route.\n\nPrerequisites\nA route-policy has been configured using the route-policy command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter a route matches a route-policy, the tag of the route is changed.\nPrecautions\nThe apply tag command sets the tag for only IGP routes."
