    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a matching rule based on a Layer 3 VNI list, run the if-match l3vni command.\nRun the route-policy command to configure a route-policy or enter the view of an existing route-policy.A route-policy may consist of multiple nodes, and the relationship among these nodes is OR. The system matches routes against the nodes in ascending order of node IDs. If a route matches a node in the route-policy, the route is not matched against the next node.Each node comprises a set of if-match and apply clauses.The if-match clauses define matching rules that are based on route attributes. The relationship among if-match clauses of the same node that are based on different route attributes is AND. Specifically, a route matches a node only when it meets all the if-match clauses of the node. The relationship among if-match clauses of the same node that are based on the same route attribute is OR; the system matches routes against the if-match clauses in order; if a route matches an if-match clause, the route matches the route-policy, and the system no longer matches the route against the rest if-match clauses. For example, the if-match community-filter 1 and if-match as-path-filter 1 configurations in node 10 are based on different route attributes. Therefore, the relationship among if-match clauses of this node is AND. The if-match community-filter 1 and if-match community-filter 2 configurations in node 30 are both based on the community attribute. Therefore, the relationship among if-match clauses of this node is OR.\n\nPrerequisites\nA VNI list has been created using the filter-list vni command.\nPrecautions\nIf the if-match l3vni command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
