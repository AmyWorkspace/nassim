    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSoO records the BGP route originator. To configure an SoO extended community filter so that BGP routes carrying SoO can be filtered, run the ip extcommunity-list soo command.\nAn SoO extended community filter can be used as a matching condition of a route-policy using a command, such as the if-match extcommunity-list soo aaa command.\nAn SoO extended community filter in different formats may lead to different matching results. For example:\nFormat 1:\nip extcommunity-list soo basic aaa permit 100:1 200:1 300:1\nFormat 2:\nip extcommunity-list soo basic aaa permit 100:1\nip extcommunity-list soo basic aaa permit 200:1 300:1\nIn format 2, the extended community defined in each rule must be a sub-set of route extended communities so that the rule can be matched.\nThe undo ip extcommunity-list soo command deletes a specified SoO extended community filter.\nThe display ip extcommunity-list soo command displays detailed configurations of the SoO extended community filter.\nPrecautions\nThe extended community attributes of a route include VPN-target and SoO. The ip extcommunity-list soo command adds an SoO extended community filter.\nBy default, Source of Origin (SoO) extended community filters work in deny mode. If all matching rules in a filter are configured to work in deny mode, all routes are denied by the filter; to prevent this problem, configure one matching rule in permit mode after one or multiple matching rules in deny mode so that the routes except for those denied by preceding matching rules are permitted by the filter."
