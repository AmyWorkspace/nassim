    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSegmented-nh (with the full name being segmented nexthop) attributes are extended community attributes that can be carried in intra-AS I-PMSI A-D routes in NG MVPN scenarios. If you want a device to match NG MVPN routes based on segmented-nh attributes in segmented NG MVPN scenarios, run the if-match extcommunity-list segmented-nh command to configure a segmented-nh attribute-based match rule.\nThe relationship between the if-match clauses in a node of a route-policy is \"AND\". A route must match all the rules before the action defined by the apply clause is taken. If no if-match clause is specified, all routes will match the node in the route-policy.\nPrerequisites\nA route-policy has been configured using the route-policy command."
