    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a matching rule that is based on the AS_Path length, run the if-match as-path length command. After the matching rule is configured, attributes of the routes that match the matching rule can be modified based on the apply clause.\nPrecautions\nAS_Path is a private attribute of BGP. Therefore, matching rules that are based on the AS_Path length are mainly used to filter BGP routes.\nIf greEqualVal is configured, but lessEqualVal is not, the maximum value 2047 of lessEqualVal is used. If lessEqualVal is configured, but greEqualVal is not, the minimum value 0 of greEqualVal is used. If both greEqualVal and lessEqualVal are configured, lessEqualVal must be greater than greEqualVal."
