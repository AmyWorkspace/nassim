    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe AS_Path attribute is a private attribute of BGP used to record all ASs that a route passes through from the local area to the destination in distance-vector (DV) order. The AS_Path attribute can be used to control route selection and prevent routing loops. When the filtering conditions specified by if-match clauses are met and the matching mode is set to permit, you can use the apply as-path command to set the AS_Path attributes of the routes that match the filtering conditions.\nRun the route-policy command to enter the Route-policy view.A route-policy may consist of multiple nodes. The relationship between the nodes is \"OR\". The system matches a route against the nodes in sequence. If the route matches a node, the system no longer matches it against other nodes.Each node comprises a set of if-match and apply clauses. The if-match clauses define the filtering rules that are used to match certain route attributes. The relationship among if-match clauses of the same node that are based on different route attributes is AND. A route matches a node only when the route matches all the filtering rules specified in the if-match clauses of the node. The apply clauses specify actions. The relationship among if-match clauses of the same node that are based on the same route attribute is OR. The system matches routes against the if-match clauses in order. If a route matches an if-match clause, the system no longer matches the route against the rest if-match clauses. For example, the if-match community-filter 1 and if-match as-path-filter 1 configurations in node 10 are based on different route attributes. Therefore, the relationship among if-match clauses of this node is AND. The if-match community-filter 1 and if-match community-filter 2 configurations in node 20 are both based on the community attribute. Therefore, the relationship among if-match clauses of this node is OR. The apply clauses specify actions. If a route matches a node, the apply clauses set some attributes for the route.\n\nPrerequisites\nA route-policy has been configured using the route-policy command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the apply as-path none overwrite command is run for an export policy and the export policy is applied to an IBGP peer, the original AS_Path attribute is changed to null.\nAfter the apply as-path command is run, the configuration is backed up to the slave main control board. You can run the display route-policy command to check whether the configuration takes effect.\nPrecautions\nRunning the apply as-path command changes the path through which network traffic passes. Use this command only when you are familiar with the network topology and impact of the command on services.\nThe undo apply as-path command cancels the configuration of clearing the original AS_Path attribute."
