    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSegment Routing TE Policy (SR-MPLS TE Policy) is a tunneling technology developed based on SR. An SR-MPLS TE Policy route dynamically generated by a controller needs to be transmitted to a forwarder through BGP extension. By default, SR-MPLS TE Policy routes are advertised only to IBGP peers. To advertise SR-MPLS TE Policy routes to EBGP peers, run the advertise ebgp enable command."
