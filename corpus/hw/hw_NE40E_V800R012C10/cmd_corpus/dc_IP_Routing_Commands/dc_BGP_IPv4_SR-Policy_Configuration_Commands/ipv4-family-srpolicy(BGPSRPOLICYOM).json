    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSR-MPLS TE Policy is a tunneling technology developed based on SR. An SR-MPLS TE Policy route dynamically generated by a controller needs to be transmitted to a forwarder through BGP extension. This function is implemented through the newly defined BGP SR-MPLS TE Policy subsequent address family identifier (SAFI). By establishing a BGP IPv4 SR-MPLS TE Policy address family-specific peer relationship between the controller and forwarder, this function enables the controller to deliver the SR-MPLS TE Policy route to the forwarder.\nBy default, the forwarder does not advertise the preferentially selected SR-MPLS TE Policy route to EBGP peers. You can run the advertise ebgp enable command to enable the forwarder to advertise the SR-MPLS TE Policy route to EBGP peers. After an SR-MPLS TE Policy is created using the SR-MPLS TE Policy route, different types of routes, such as VPN routes and public BGP routes, can be recursed to the SR-MPLS TE Policy.\nBefore you configure the BGP IPv4 SR-MPLS TE Policy address family, run the ipv4-family sr-policy command in the BGP view to enable the address family and enter the address family view."
