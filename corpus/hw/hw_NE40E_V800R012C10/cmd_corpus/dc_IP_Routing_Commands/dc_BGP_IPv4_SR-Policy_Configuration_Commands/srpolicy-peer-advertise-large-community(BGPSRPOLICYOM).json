    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a device to advertise the Large-Community attribute to its BGP peer, run the peer advertise-large-community command. If the Large-Community attribute is advertised to a peer, all the peer members in the group inherit this configuration. This simplifies the application of route-policies and facilitates route maintenance and management.\nPrerequisites\nSpecific Large-Community values have been defined in a route-policy."
