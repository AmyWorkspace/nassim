    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf OSPF remote LFA FRR is enabled and the primary link fails, traffic is switched to the backup link. If route convergence occurs again, traffic is switched from the backup link to a new primary link. During the switchover, microloop may occur. To prevent this problem, OSPF anti-microloop is enabled by default and delays the switching. To configure a delay after which OSPF delivers routes, run the avoid-microloop frr-protected rib-update-delay command. After the command is run, OSPF does not switch traffic to the backup link in the preceding scenario until the delay elapses.\nPrerequisites\nOSPF has been enabled using the ospf command."
