    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nExternal factors may affect the physical bandwidth of links and change the physical bandwidth of interfaces, which in turn affects network performance. To configure a device to adjust and optimize route selection rules, you can run the bandwidth  command in the interface view to set configuration bandwidth for the interface, and then run the bandwidth-config enable command to enable the device to calculate the cost for the interface based on the configuration bandwidth of the interface.\nPrecautions\nIf the bandwidth command is not run, the cost is calculated based on the physical bandwidth of each OSPF interface.If the bandwidth-config enable command is not run, the cost is calculated based on the physical bandwidth of each OSPF interface."
