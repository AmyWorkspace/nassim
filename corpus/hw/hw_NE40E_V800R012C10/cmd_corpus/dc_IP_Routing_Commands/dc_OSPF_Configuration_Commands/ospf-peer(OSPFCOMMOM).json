    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an NBMA network (such as an X.25 network), the entire network can be fully meshed if adjacent router mapping is configured. With the mapping, there is a virtual link between any two routers. In this case, the OSPF network can be considered as a broadcast network where a DR or BDR can be selected. However, adjacent routers cannot be detected dynamically by broadcasting Hello packets. To address this problem, run the peer command to specify an IP address and a DR priority for each adjacent router."
