    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an interface carrying OSPF services alternates between Up and Down, OSPF neighbor relationship flapping occurs on the interface. During the flapping, OSPF frequently sends Hello packets to reestablish the neighbor relationship, synchronizes LSDBs, and recalculates routes. In this process, a large number of packets are exchanged, adversely affecting neighbor relationship stability, OSPF services, and other OSPF-dependent services, such as BGP. OSPF neighbor relationship flapping suppression can address this problem by delaying OSPF neighbor relationship reestablishment or preventing service traffic from passing through flapping links.\nBy default, OSPF neighbor relationship flapping suppression is enabled globally. To disable this function globally, run the suppress-flapping peer disable command."
