    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen multiple links exist between two devices on a P2P, broadcast, or NBMA network, the ospf filter-lsa-out command configures the local device to filter outgoing LSAs before sending them along specified links. This can reduce the unnecessary retransmission of LSAs and save bandwidth resources.\nConfiguration Impact\nFiltering outgoing LSAs on an OSPF interface can prevent useless LSAs from being sent to neighbors. This can reduce the size of the LSDB of neighbors and speed up the network convergence.\nAfter the command is configured on an interface, the OSPF neighbor relationship of the interface will automatically re-establish.\nPrecautions\nConfigure the filtering rules for a named ACL only the source address range that is specified in source and the period that is specified in time-range take effect.\nGrace LSAs are used to inform the neighbor of the Graceful Restart (GR) time, cause, and interface instance ID when GR starts and ends. The command is not used to filter the grace LSAs.\nAfter the ospf filter-lsa-out command is run, the LSAs that other devices have received before will not be deleted immediately, but it will be deleted after a period of time (usually no more than one hour)."
