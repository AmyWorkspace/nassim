    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the primary LSP recovers from a fault, you can use the ospf timer ldp-sync hold-max-cost command to set the interval during which traffic is still transmitted along the backup LSP before the LDP session and LDP adjacency of the primary LSP are reestablished.\nYou can choose different parameters as required.\nWhen OSPF carries only LDP services, set infinite to ensure that the OSPF route is always consistent with the LDP LSP.When OSPF carries multiple services, including LDP services, specify value to ensure that OSPF route selection and other services are normal if an LDP session or LDP adjacency for the primary LSP fails.\n\nPrecautions\nIf this command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous ones."
