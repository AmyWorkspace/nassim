    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the OSPF Session-CAR function is enabled, which isolates packet channels between OSPF sessions. To disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car ospf disable command. After the configuration, OSPF packets received by the device are directly sent to the CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of OSPF packets in this case, packets from different OSPF sessions may preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not recommended in normal cases.\nPrecautions\nTo check whether CAR for whitelisted OSPF sessions is supported on each board, run the display cpu-defend whitelist session-car ospf statistics slot <slot-id> command."
