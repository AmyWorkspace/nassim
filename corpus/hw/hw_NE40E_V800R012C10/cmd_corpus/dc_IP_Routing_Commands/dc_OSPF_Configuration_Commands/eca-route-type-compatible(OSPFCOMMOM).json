    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe eca-route-type compatible command is used in OSPF VPN scenarios.\nFor the Router supporting standard protocol, you can set the route type of the extended community attribute of OSPF VPN to 0x0306 and configure the Router to identify both 0x0306 and 0x8000 route types.For the Router that does not support standard protocol, you can set the route type of the extended community attribute of OSPF VPN to 0x8000 and configure the Router to identify only the 0x8000 route type.\nBy running the eca-route-type compatible command enables Routers to communicate with each other and avoid the failure in parsing the route type because the route type of the extended community attribute of OSPF VPN is unrecognized.\n\nPrecautions\nThe eca-route-type compatible command cannot be run on the public network."
