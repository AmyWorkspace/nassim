    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a network fault occurs, IGP convergence is triggered. In this case, a transient forwarding status inconsistency may occur among nodes because of their different convergence rates, which poses the risk of microloops. If the outbound interface of a route before IGP convergence is a shortcut TE tunnel interface and the OSPF TE tunnel anti-microloop function is enabled, the outbound interface of the route remains unchanged during the IGP convergence. In this case, traffic is forwarded through a hot standby TE tunnel, and the forwarding process does not depend on IGP convergence on each device, preventing microloops. To configure a switchback delay (delay in delivering the OSPF routes whose outbound interface is a TE tunnel interface), run the avoid-microloop te-tunnel rib-update-delay command."
