    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOSPF interfaces use Hello packets to establish and maintain adjacencies. A Hello packet includes information about the designated router (DR), backup designated router (BDR), timers, and known neighbors.\nTo set the interval at which Hello packets are sent, run the ospf timer hello multi-area command. The hello interval value will be added to Hello packets. A smaller hello interval value indicates a larger route cost and a higher speed in detecting topology changes. Ensure that parameters on the interface and those on its neighbor are the same.\nPrerequisites\nThe ospf enable multi-area area-id command has been run.\nPrecautions\nThe ospf timer hello multi-area command does not apply to null interfaces."
