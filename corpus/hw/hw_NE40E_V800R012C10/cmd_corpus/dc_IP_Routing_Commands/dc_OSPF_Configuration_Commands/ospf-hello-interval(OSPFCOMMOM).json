    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nHello packets are periodically exchanged by OSPF interfaces to establish and maintain neighbor relationships. A Hello packet contains information about timers, DRs, BDRs, and known neighbors.\nThe smaller the interval value, the faster a network topology change can be detected, and the larger the route cost. Ensure that the parameters of this interface and the adjacent routers are consistent.\nTo speed up OSPF convergence in the case of a link failure, configuring BFD For OSPF is recommended. If the remote end does not support BFD for OSPF or you do not want to configure BFD for OSPF, specify conservative when you run the ospf timer hello command. If the conservative mode is configured, the value configured for the dead timer using the ospf timer dead command takes effect even when the value is less than 10s; if the value configured for the dead timer is greater than 10s, services may be affected.\nPrecautions\nThe ospf timer hello command cannot be run on a null interface.\nIf the configured interval (X) for sending Hello packets is less than 10s, the actual interval (Y) for sending Hello packets is calculated using the following formula:\nY = X/2 + X%2, where X/2 refers to the rounded-off value of X divided by 2, and X%2 refers to X mod 2. For example, if X equals 5, then X/2 equals 2, and X%2 equals 1.\nIf the interval for sending Hello packets is set and the ospf timer dead command is not run, the dead interval for OSPF neighbors is four times the interval for sending Hello packets. Therefore, if the interval for sending Hello packets is less than or equal to 2s, the dead interval for OSPF neighbors is less than 10s. In this case, if no Hello packets are received within the dead interval, the neighbor relationships are disconnected. To prevent neighbor relationship flapping and improve network reliability, the system automatically sets the dead interval for OSPF neighbors to 10s if the actual dead interval is less than 10s. However, if the conservative mode is enabled for the dead interval for OSPF neighbors, the dead interval that is four times the interval for sending Hello packets is still used to check whether OSPF neighbors are valid."
