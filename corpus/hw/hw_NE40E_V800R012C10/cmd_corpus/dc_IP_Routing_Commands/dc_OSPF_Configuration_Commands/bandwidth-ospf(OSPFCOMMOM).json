    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe interface cost calculation formula is as follows: Interface cost = Bandwidth reference value/Interface bandwidth. The system only supports integer interface costs. If a calculated result is smaller than 1, such as 0.3, the system takes 1 as the result. If a calculated result is greater than 1 but not an integer, such as 2.3, the system takes the integer (2 in this example) as the result. If the bandwidth-reference command is executed to configure a new bandwidth reference value, the interface cost will be changed, and OSPF will re-select routes.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the bandwidth-reference command is configured in a process, bandwidth reference values of all interfaces in the process are changed to the specified value."
