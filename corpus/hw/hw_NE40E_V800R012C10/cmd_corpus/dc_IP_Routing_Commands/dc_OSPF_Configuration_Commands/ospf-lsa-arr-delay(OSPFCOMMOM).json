    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf no flapping occurs among received OSPF LSAs, the configuration of the lsa-arrival-interval command prevents the device from frequently receiving LSAs. If received OSPF LSAs flap, the configuration of the lsa-arrival-interval suppress-flapping command minimizes the impact of the flapping on services. The larger value of the two intervals specified in the commands is used as the suppression period.\nThe suppression mechanism takes effect based on the following rules:\nFlapping detection: OSPF starts a flapping counter. If the interval between two OSPF LSAs that are received successively is less than or equal to 10s, OSPF records a flapping event and increases the flapping_count by 1.Suppression phase: If the flapping_count is greater than or equal to , flapping suppression takes effect.Suppression exit: If the interval between two OSPF LSAs that are received successively is greater than 10s, OSPF resets the flapping_count and exits from suppression."
