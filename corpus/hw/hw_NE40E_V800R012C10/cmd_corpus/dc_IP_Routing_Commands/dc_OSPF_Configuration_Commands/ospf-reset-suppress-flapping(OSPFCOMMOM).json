If the neighbors fail to receive such Hello packets, the function of notify-peer does not take effect. To force the neighbors to exit from OSPF neighbor relationship flapping suppression, run the reset ospf suppress-flapping peer command on them.\nThe OSPF process or the specified interface exits from flapping suppression in the following scenarios:\nThe suppression timer expires.The OSPF process is reset.The reset ospf suppress-flapping peer command is run.An OSPF neighbor is reset using the reset ospf peer command.OSPF neighbor relationship flapping suppression is disabled globally using the suppress-flapping peer disable (OSPF) command.\nIf notify-peer is specified when the reset ospf suppress-flapping peer command is run on a device, the device sends Hello packets in which HelloInterval and RouterDeadInterval are 0s to its neighbors to instruct the neighbors to exit from OSPF neighbor relationship flapping suppression too.
