    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOSPF can automatically calculate the link cost for an interface based on the interface bandwidth. You can also set the link cost for the interface using the ospf cost command. Load balancing can be implemented among several routes of the same protocol, cost, and destination address. According to the actual networking condition, you can determine whether to perform load balancing by changing the interface cost.\nIf no cost is set for an OSPF interface using the ospf cost command, OSPF automatically calculates its cost based on the interface bandwidth. The calculation formula is as follows: Cost of the interface = Bandwidth reference value/Interface bandwidth. The integer of the calculated result is the cost of the interface. If the calculated result is smaller than 1, the cost is 1. Changing the bandwidth reference value can change the cost of an interface.\nBy default, the bandwidth reference value is 100 Mbit/s divided by the interface bandwidth. With the formula 100000000/Bandwidth, the default costs of the Ethernet (100 Mbit/s) interface is 1.\nNo default cost is configured for trunk interfaces, because they have multiple member interfaces that are in constant change.\nPrecautions\nThe ospf cost command cannot run on null interfaces."
