    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo view information about the topology based on which OSPF routes are calculated, including the cause of route calculation, and the number of changed routes, run the display ospf topology command. The command output helps you diagnose OSPF route flapping.\nIf segment routing is configured and a segment routing next hop exists, the display ospf topology verbose command displays the segment routing next hop. If segment routing anti-micro loop is configured and the device is in the anti-micro loop state, the display ospf topology verbose command displays the label stack of segment routing anti-micro loop."
