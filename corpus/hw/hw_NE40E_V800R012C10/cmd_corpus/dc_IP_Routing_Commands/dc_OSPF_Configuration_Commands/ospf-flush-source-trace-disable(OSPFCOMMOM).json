    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf network-wide OSPF LSAs are flushed, network stability will be adversely affected. In this case, source tracing must be implemented to locate the root cause of the fault immediately to minimize the impact. However, OSPF itself does not support source tracing. A conventional solution is isolation node by node until the faulty node is located. The solution is complex and time-consuming. OSPF flush LSA source tracing can address this problem. In the preceding scenario, OSPF flush LSA source tracing packets are flooded on the network, and the node that flushed the LSAs can be queried on any device on the network, which speeds up fault locating and faulty node isolation.\nTo disable OSPF flush LSA source tracing globally, run the ospf flush-source-trace disable command. To disable Vlink OSPF flush LSA source tracing, run the ospf flush-source-trace vlink disable command."
