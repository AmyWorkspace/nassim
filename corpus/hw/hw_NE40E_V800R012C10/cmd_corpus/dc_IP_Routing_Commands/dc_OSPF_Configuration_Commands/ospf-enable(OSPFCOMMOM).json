    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ospf enable command configuration takes precedence over the network command configuration.\nAfter the undo ospf enable command is run to disable OSPF from an interface, the network configuration takes effect on the interface automatically.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe interface will alternate between Up and Down when the ospf enable and network commands are run on the interface repeatedly.\nPrecautions\nThe area specified in the ospf enable command must have been created. Otherwise, the configuration does not take effect.\nThe configured interface and the OSPF process must be in the same VPN.\nThe ospf enable command can be configured on an interface before an OSPF process is created. The interface specified in the ospf enable command and the created OSPF process must be in the same VPN.If a process is created before the ospf enable command is run on an interface, the process of the interface and existing process must belong to the same VPN. Otherwise, the ospf enable command cannot be run.If no OSPF process is created, interfaces that belong to different VPN instances cannot be added to the same OSPF process."
