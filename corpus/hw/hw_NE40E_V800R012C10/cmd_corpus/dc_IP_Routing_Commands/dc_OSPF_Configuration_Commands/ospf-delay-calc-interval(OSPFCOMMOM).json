    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFrequent OSPF LSA flapping on the remote device may lead to route flapping on the local device, affecting services. To address this problem, run the maxage-lsa route-calculate-delay command to configure the local device to delay route calculation in the case of frequent OSPF LSA flapping, which suppresses route flapping locally."
