    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf OSPF interfaces frequently alternate between up and down, the interfaces will flap, and protocol packets will be frequently exchanged, affecting OSPF services. To address this issue, run the undo ospf suppress-flapping interface disable command to enable interface flapping suppression. This function allows a device to delay interface state changes to up.\nBy default, interface flapping suppression is enabled globally for all OSPF interfaces. If this function is not needed, run the ospf suppress-flapping interface disable command to disable it."
