    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe OSPF flush LSA source tracing port receives and sends OSPF flush LSA source tracing packets, and the port is identified by a UDP port number.\nIf the UDP port number conflicts with that of an application, you can change the UDP port number of OSPF flush LSA source tracing packets using the ospf flush-source-trace port command. To change the UDP port number of Vlink OSPF flush LSA source tracing packets, run the ospf flush-source-trace vlink port command."
