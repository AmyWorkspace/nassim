    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prevent the link that travels through the devices running important services from becoming a backup link, run the ospf frr block command on the devices. In this manner, services on the devices are not affected when FRR calculation is performed.\nPrecautions\nBefore configuring OSPF IP FRR, run the ospf frr block command to block FRR on a specified interface. In this manner, the link where the interface resides is not calculated as a backup link during FRR calculation."
