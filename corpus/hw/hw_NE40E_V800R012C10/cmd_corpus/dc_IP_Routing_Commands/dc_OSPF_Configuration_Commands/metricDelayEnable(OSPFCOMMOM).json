    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTraditional path computation algorithms compute the optimal path to a destination address based on costs. However, the optimal path computed based on costs may not be the path with the minimum delay. For services that have stringent requirements on delay, configure path computation based on delay instead of costs to ensure that service traffic is transmitted along the path with the minimum delay. To enable delay information advertisement, run the metric-delay advertisement enable command so that information about intra-domain link delay is collected and advertised through OSPF and reported to the controller through BGP-LS. This allows the controller to use delay constraints to compute paths of the P2P network.\nPrecautions\nDelay information advertisement takes effect only if the metric-delay advertisement enable command is run in an OSPF process and an interface in the OSPF process is bound to a TWAMP Light test session."
