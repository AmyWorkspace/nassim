    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter OSPF areas are defined, OSPF route updates between non-backbone areas are transmitted through a backbone area. Therefore, OSPF requires that all non-backbone areas maintain the connectivity with the backbone area and the backbone areas in different OSPF areas maintain the connectivity with each other. In real world situations, this requirement may not be met because of some restrictions. To resolve this problem, you can configure OSPF virtual links.\nThe display ospf vlink command displays OSPF virtual link information, which can help you troubleshoot OSPF virtual link faults."
