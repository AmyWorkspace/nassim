    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOSPF can automatically calculate the cost for an interface according to the interface bandwidth. The cost can also be configured using the ospf cost command. If multiple routes with the same protocol, cost, and destination IP address are available, they participate in load balancing. You can determine whether load balancing is implemented by changing the cost.\nIf no cost is configured for a multi-area adjacency interface using the ospf cost multi-area command, OSPF calculates the cost by dividing the bandwidth reference value by the interface bandwidth. The integer of the quotient is used as the cost of the interface. If the quotient is less than 1, the cost is 1. Changing the bandwidth reference value can change the cost of an interface.\nBy default, the bandwidth reference value is 100 Mbit/s. The default cost of Ethernet interfaces is 1 because their interface bandwidth is 100 Mbit/s.\nThe bandwidth of each trunk interface is the sum of bandwidth of all member interfaces, and the member interfaces constantly change. Therefore, trunk interfaces have no default cost.\nPrerequisites\nThe ospf enable multi-area command has been run.\nPrecautions\nThe ospf cost multi-area command does not apply to null interfaces."
