    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an active link between two devices enabled with LDP and OSPF synchronization recovers from a fault, the OSPF module enters the Hold-down state and starts a Hold-down timer. This setting allows an interface to create an LDP session and an LDP adjacency before setting up an OSPF neighbor relationship. Traffic can switch back to the active link over a reachable OSPF route for an established LDP LSP.\nThe ospf timer ldp-sync hold-down command sets the Hold-down timer value."
