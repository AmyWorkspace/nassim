    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThere are two stub area-related commands: stub and default-cost (OSPF). If you want to configure one area as a stub area, run the stub command on all devices in the area.\nThe default-cost (OSPF) command is used to specify the cost of the default summary route that the ABR sends to the stub area. The command takes effect only when it is run on an ABR.\nOn an ABR, you can configure no-summary in the stub command to prevent Type 3 LSAs from entering the stub area to which the ABR connects.\nIf default-route-advertise and backbone-peer-ignore are configured in the command, the ABR is prevented from checking the neighbor status when it generates a default Type 3 LSA and advertises it to the stub area."
