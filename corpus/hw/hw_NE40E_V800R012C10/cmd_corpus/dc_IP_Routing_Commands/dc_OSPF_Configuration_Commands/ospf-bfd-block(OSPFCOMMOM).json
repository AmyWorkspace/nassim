    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the bfd all-interfaces enable command is run in an OSPF process, BFD sessions are created on all the OSPF interfaces whose neighbor status is Full. If BFD is not required on some interfaces, run the ospf bfd block command on the interfaces to prevent them from dynamically setting up BFD sessions.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been enabled on interfaces.\nPrecautions\nThe ospf bfd enable command and ospf bfd block command are mutually exclusive in function, and the later configuration overwrites the previous one."
