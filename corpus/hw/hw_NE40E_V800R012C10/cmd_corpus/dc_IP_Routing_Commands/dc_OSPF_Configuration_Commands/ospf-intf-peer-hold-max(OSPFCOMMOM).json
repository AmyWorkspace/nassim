    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an OSPF interface changes from Down to Up, the OSPF neighbor relationship is re-established. When IGP route convergence ends, traffic is switched back. IGP routes converge fast. Many services that depend on IGP routes may require a delayed switchback. In this case, you can run the ospf peer hold-max-cost command so that OSPF keeps the maximum cost in local LSAs for a specified period after the OSPF neighbor relationship reaches Full state. During this period, the traffic forwarding path remains unchanged. After this period elapses, the original cost is restored, and traffic is switched back."
