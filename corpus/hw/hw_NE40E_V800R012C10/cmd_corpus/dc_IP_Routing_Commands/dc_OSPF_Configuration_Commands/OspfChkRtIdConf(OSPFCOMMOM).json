    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a router ID conflict occurs in an OSPF area, the system selects a new router ID, which prevents route flapping and reduces route calculation operations. Other protocols will not go Down when the CPU usage is controlled.\nIf the automatic recovery function is enabled and a router ID conflict occurs between indirectly connected routers in one OSPF area, the system replaces the conflicted router ID with a newly calculated one. The automatic recovery function takes effect on both configured and automatically generated router IDs.The system can replace a router ID in a maximum of three attempts in case the router ID conflict persists."
