To disable Remote LFA on OSPF interfaces, run the ospf remote-lfa disable command with corresponding parameter specified.\nPrecautions\nIf the remote-lfa command is not run prior to the ospf remote-lfa disable command, the ospf remote-lfa disable command can be run, but its configuration does not take effect on interfaces.\nIf you run the remote-lfa command when the ospf remote-lfa disable command has been run, Remote LFA is disabled."
