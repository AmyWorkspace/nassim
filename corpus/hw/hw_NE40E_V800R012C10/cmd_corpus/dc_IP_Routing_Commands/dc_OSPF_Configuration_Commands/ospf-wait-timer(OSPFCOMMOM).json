    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo change the wait timer, run the ospf timer wait command. If no Backup Seen event is received within the timer, the designated router (DR) election starts. Setting a proper value for the wait timer can slow down changes of the DR and the backup designated router (BDR) on the network, reducing network flapping. When setting the wait timer, note the following points:\nThe wait timer takes effect only on broadcast and NBMA interfaces.The value of the wait timer cannot be greater than the value of the dead timer.\n\nPrecautions\nThe command cannot be run on a null interface."
