    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a P2MP network, when multiple P2MP links exist between two devices, you can configure the local router to filter the outgoing LSAs on the specified link. This can reduce unnecessary LSA retransmission attempts and save bandwidth resources.\nFor a named ACL, configure filtering rules, only the source address range that is specified by the source parameter and the period of time that is specified by the time-range parameter take effect.\nPrerequisites\nThe network type has been changed to P2MP using the ospf network-type p2mp command.\nPrecautions\nConfigure a router to filter the outgoing LSAs on the specified OSPF interface, run the ospf filter-lsa-out command.\nAfter the filter-lsa-out peer command is run, the LSAs that other devices have received before will not be deleted immediately, but it will be deleted after a period of time (usually no more than one hour)."
