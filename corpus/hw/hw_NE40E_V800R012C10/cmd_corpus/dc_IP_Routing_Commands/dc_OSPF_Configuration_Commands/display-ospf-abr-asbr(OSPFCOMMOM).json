    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn ABR can belong to two or more areas, and one of the areas must be a backbone area. An ABR is used to connect the backbone area and non-backbone areas. It can be physically or logically connected to the backbone area.\nAn ASBR exchanges routing information with other ASs. An ASBR may not reside at the boundary of an AS. It can be an internal router or an ABR. If an OSPF device imports external routes, the router is an ASBR.\nTo view information about the ABRs and ASBRs of OSPF, run the display ospf abr-asbr command."
