    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf no Hello packet is received from a neighbor within a dead interval, the neighbor is considered invalid. The dead interval on OSPF interfaces must be greater than the transmission interval of Hello messages. In addition, the dead intervals of devices on the same network segment must be the same.\nBy default, the dead interval of OSPF neighbors is four times the transmission interval of Hello messages.\nPrecautions\nThe command cannot be run on a null interface.\nIf the dead interval of an OSPF neighbor is shorter than 10s, the session may be closed. Therefore, if dead interval is shorter than 10s, the actual dead interval of an OSPF neighbor is not shorter than 10s. If the conservative mode is configured using the ospf timer hello command, the configured dead timer takes effect even when its value is less than 10s.\nTo speed up OSPF convergence in the case of a link failure, configuring BFD For OSPF is recommended."
