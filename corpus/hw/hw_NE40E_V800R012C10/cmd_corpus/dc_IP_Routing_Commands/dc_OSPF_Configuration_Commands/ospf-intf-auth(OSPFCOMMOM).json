    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDue to inherent defects and flawed implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite, there are an increasing number of attacks, which poses greater threats on TCP/IP networks than ever before. The attacks on network devices may lead to network failures. To configure an authentication mode and a password for an OSPF interface to improve OSPF network security, run the ospf authentication-mode command.\nConfiguration Impact\nInterface authentication is used to set authentication mode and password used between neighboring devices. It takes precedence over area authentication. If both interface authentication and area authentication are configured, the authentication succeeds as long as the interface authentication succeeds. If authentication is configured on an interface, OSPFv3 neighbor relationships can be established on the interface as long as interface authentication succeeds, regardless of the area authentication configuration or whether area authentication is configured.\nPrecautions\nNull authentication is also an authentication method. It does not indicate that no authentication is configured.\nThe authentication mode and password configured on the device interfaces on the same network segment must be the same."
