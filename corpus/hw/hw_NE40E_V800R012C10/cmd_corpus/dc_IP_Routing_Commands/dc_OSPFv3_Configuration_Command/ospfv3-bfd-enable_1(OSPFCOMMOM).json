    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEither a link fault or topology change on a network will cause routes to be re-calculated within an area. As such, speeding up the convergence of a routing protocol is critical to improving the network performance.\nAs link faults are inevitable, rapidly detecting these faults and notifying routing protocols is an effective way to quickly mitigate them. This includes associating BFD with a routing protocol to speed up convergence of the routing protocol once a link fault occurs.\nDuring the configuration of OSPFv3 IP FRR, the lower layer can fast respond to the link change so that traffic can be rapidly switched to the backup link if the primary link fails. By setting frr-binding, you can associate the BFD session status with the link status of an interface (when the BFD session goes Down, the link status of the interface becomes Down) so that link faults can be rapidly detected.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been enabled on the interface.\nImplementation Procedure\nThe receive-interval is negotiated by the local and peer ends by comparing the values of the local min-rx-interval and the peer min-tx-interval. If the local end fails to receive a BFD packet from the neighbor within an interval of receive-interval * multiplier-value, the local end considers the neighbor Down.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf global BFD is not enabled, BFD can be enabled on an interface. The BFD session, however, cannot be set up after BFD is enabled on the interface. If the parameters of a BFD session are set but the ospfv3 bfd enable command is not run, the BFD session cannot be set up.\nThe BFD configuration on an interface takes precedence over that in a process. If BFD is enabled on an interface, a BFD session is established according to the BFD parameters set on the interface.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display ospfv3 bfd session command to view the information about neighbors enabled with BFD.\nPrecautions\nAfter BFD is enabled, a device sets up BFD sessions with only adjacencies.\nThe ospfv3 bfd enable command and ospfv3 bfd block command are mutually exclusive in function, and the later configuration overwrites the previous one.\nAfter BFD is disabled from an interface using the undo ospfv3 bfd enable command, the parameters for setting up BFD sessions remain on this interface but no longer take effect."
