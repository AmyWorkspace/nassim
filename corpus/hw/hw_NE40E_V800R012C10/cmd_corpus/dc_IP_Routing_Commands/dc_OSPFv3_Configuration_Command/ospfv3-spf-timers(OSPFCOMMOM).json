    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAccording to the local LSDB, the Router that runs OSPFv3 can calculate an SPT with itself as the root and determines the next hop to the destination network according to the SPT. To use a common Shortest Path First (SPT) timer to calculate the interval at which OSPFv3 routes are calculated, run the spf timers command. Adjusting the SPF calculation interval can avoid the exhaustion of bandwidth and router sources caused by frequent change of the network.\nA common SPF timer and an intelligent SPF timer are mutually exclusive."
