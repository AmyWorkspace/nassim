    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe transmission mechanism of OSPFv3 packets is applicable to the following packets:\nDD packetsUpdate packetsRequest packets\nIf the three types of packets cannot receive response packets, enable the retransmission limit, set the maximum number of retransmissions, and disconnect the neighbor when the number of retransmissions exceeds the specified value.\nIn this manner, neighbor flapping caused by packet loss can be avoided.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the maximum number of retransmissions is set too small, route flapping may occur. If the maximum number of retransmissions is set too large, neighbor information of the local device may become incorrect."
