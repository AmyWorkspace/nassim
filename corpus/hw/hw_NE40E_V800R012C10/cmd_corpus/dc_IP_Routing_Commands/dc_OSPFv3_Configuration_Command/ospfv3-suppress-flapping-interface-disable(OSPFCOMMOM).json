    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf OSPFv3 interfaces frequently alternate between up and down, the interfaces will flap, and protocol packets will be frequently exchanged, affecting OSPFv3 services. To address this issue, run the undo ospfv3 suppress-flapping interface disable command to enable interface flapping suppression. This function allows a device to delay interface state changes to up.\nBy default, interface flapping suppression is enabled globally for all OSPFv3 interfaces. If this function is not needed, run the ospfv3 suppress-flapping interface disable command to disable it."
