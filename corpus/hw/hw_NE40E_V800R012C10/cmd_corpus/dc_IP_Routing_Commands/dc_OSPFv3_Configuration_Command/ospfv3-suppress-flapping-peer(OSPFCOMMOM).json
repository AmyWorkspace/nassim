    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an interface carrying OSPFv3 services alternates between Up and Down, OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping occurs on the interface. During the flapping, OSPFv3 frequently sends Hello packets to reestablish the neighbor relationship, synchronizes LSDBs, and recalculates routes. In this process, a large number of packets are exchanged, adversely affecting neighbor relationship stability, OSPFv3 services, and other OSPFv3-dependent services, such as BGP. OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping suppression can address this problem by delaying OSPFv3 neighbor relationship reestablishment or preventing service traffic from passing through flapping links.\nBy default, OSPFv3 neighbor relationship flapping suppression is enabled globally. To disable this function globally, run the suppress-flapping peer disable command."
