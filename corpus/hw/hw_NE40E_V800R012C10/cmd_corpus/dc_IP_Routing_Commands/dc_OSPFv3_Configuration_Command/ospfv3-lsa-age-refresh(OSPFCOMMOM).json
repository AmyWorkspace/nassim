    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an exception occurs in the age field of LSAs, LSAs may be aged unexpectedly, causing LSA flapping or a route calculation error. For example, if the abnormal aging time is 2500s and the actual aging time is 500s, LSAs are aged prematurely. To address this problem, OSPFv3 LSA aging management is enabled by default. If the aging time in a received LSA is greater than 1800s, OSPFv3 considers the LSA abnormal and changes the aging time to 1700s until the aging time values of all LSAs in the area become the same. In this case, routes can be calculated correctly."
