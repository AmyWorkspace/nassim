    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe number of devices increases with the network expansion, which leads to a large LSDB on each OSPFv3-enabled device on a large-scale network. Consequently, route flapping frequently occurs, and a large number of OSPFv3 packets are transmitted on the network, which wastes bandwidth resources.\nOSPFv3 addresses the preceding problem by logically partitioning an AS into different areas.\nPrerequisites\nBefore creating and entering an OSPFv3 area, you need to enter the OSPFv3 process.\nPrecautions\nAfter an AS is partitioned into different areas, not all areas are equal. The area with ID 0 is a backbone area. The backbone area is responsible for forwarding inter-area routes. In addition, the routing information between non-backbone areas must be forwarded through the backbone area.\nThe first time the area command is run, an OSPFv3 area is created and the OSPFv3 area view is displayed; running the area command later enters the OSPFv3 area view only.\nIf the undo area command is run, all configurations in the OSPFv3 area are deleted. Therefore, exercise caution when using the command."
