    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the interface cost is not set, OSPFv3 calculates it according to the link bandwidth (Cost = Reference Value/Bandwidth). The ospfv3 cost command sets a cost for an OSPFv3 interface. The priority of the cost set using the ospfv3 cost command is higher than that of the cost set using the bandwidth-reference command."
