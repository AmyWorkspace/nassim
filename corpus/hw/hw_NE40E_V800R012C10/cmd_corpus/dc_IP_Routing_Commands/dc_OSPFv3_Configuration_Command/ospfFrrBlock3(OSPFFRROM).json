In this manner, services on the devices are not affected when FRR calculation is performed.\nPrecautions\nBefore configuring OSPFv3 IP FRR, you need to run the ospfv3 frr block command to block FRR on a specified interface. In this manner, the link where the interface resides is not calculated as a backup link during FRR calculation."
