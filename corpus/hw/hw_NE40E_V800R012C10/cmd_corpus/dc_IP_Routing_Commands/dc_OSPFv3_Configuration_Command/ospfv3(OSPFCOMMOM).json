Otherwise, the OSPFv3 process can be viewed, but LSAs cannot be generated.\nRunning the undo ospfv3 command will also delete all configurations from the OSPFv3 view. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command.\nospfv3 <process-id> [ vpn6-instance <vpnname> ] command is to be compatible with older version and only valid in the configuration loading when restarts."
