If the lsa-forwarding-address standard command is run, only the Type 7 LSAs with the P bit set to 1 and a non-zero FA can be translated into Type 5 LSAs. If the lsa-forwarding-address zero-translate command is run, the Type 7 LSAs with the P bit set to 1 and without the FA can be translated into Type 5 LSAs."
