    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRoutes with the same IPv6 prefix can be summarized into one route. On a large-scale OSPFv3 network, route lookup may slow down because of the large size of the routing table. To reduce the routing table size and simplify management, configure route summarization. With route summarization, if a link connected to a device within an IPv6 address range that has been summarized alternates between Up and Down, the link status change is not advertised to the devices beyond the IPv6 address range. This prevents route flapping and improves network stability.\nTo configure route summarization on an ABR, run the abr-summary command. When an ABR transmits routing information to other areas, it generates Type 3 LSAs for each network segment. If contiguous segments exist in this area, run the abr-summary command to summarize these segments into one segment so that the ABR sends only one summarized LSA. The summarization reduces the routing table size and improves device performance.\nPrecautions\nThe abr-summary command applies only to ABRs. To configure route summarization on an AS boundary router (ASBR), run the asbr-summary command."
