If an area is configured as a stub area, the stub command must be run in the OSPFv3 view on all Routers in the area.\nYou can run the default-cost(OSPFV3) command in the OSPFv3 area view to specify the cost of the default route sent from an ABR to a stub area. This command takes effect only on an ABR."
