    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf multiple routes with the same cost to the same destination are available, they can carry out load balancing. The maximum load-balancing command sets the maximum number of equal-cost routes for carrying out load balancing. This optimizes route selection rules and meet traffic forwarding requirements on a complex network.\nConfiguration Impact\nPackets will be load-balanced by multiple equal-cost routes to one destination.\nLoad balancing is performed either per-destination or per-packet. By default, packets are load-balanced per-destination.\nThe undo maximum load-balancing command restores the default maximum number of 32 equal-cost routes that are discovered by OSPFv3 for load balancing.\nPrecautions\nTo disable load balancing, set the value of number to 1."
