    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nQPPB advertises QoS policies through BGP. With QPPB, a BGP route sender can set attributes (QoS local ID for example) for the BGP routes for differentiation, and the BGP route receiver can apply different local QoS policies to the BGP routes based on the attributes set by the BGP route sender. To enable OSPFv3 QPPB, run the qppb enable command. After the command is run, OSPFv3 can set the QoS local ID for routes in the routing table."
