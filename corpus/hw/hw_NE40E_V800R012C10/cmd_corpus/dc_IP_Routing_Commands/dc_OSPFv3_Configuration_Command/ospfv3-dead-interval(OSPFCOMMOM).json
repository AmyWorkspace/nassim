The command cannot be run on P2MP and NBMA interfaces.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf no Hello packet is received from a neighbor within a dead interval, the neighbor is considered invalid. The dead interval of Routers in the same network segment must be consistent.\nPrecautions\nThe command cannot be run on a null interface.\nIf the dead interval of an OSPFv3 neighbor is shorter than 10s, the session may be closed. Therefore, if dead interval is shorter than 10s, the actual dead interval of an OSPFv3 neighbor is not shorter than 10s. If the conservative mode is configured using the ospfv3 timer hello command, the configured dead timer takes effect even when its value is less than 10s.\nTo speed up OSPFv3 convergence in the case of a link failure, configuring BFD For OSPFv3 is recommended."
