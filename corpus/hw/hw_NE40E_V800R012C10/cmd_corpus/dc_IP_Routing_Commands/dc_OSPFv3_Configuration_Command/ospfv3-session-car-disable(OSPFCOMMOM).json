    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the OSPFv3 Session-CAR function is enabled, which isolates packet channels between OSPFv3 sessions.\nTo disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car ospfv3 disable command. After the configuration, OSPFv3 packets received by the device are directly sent to the CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of OSPFv3 packets in this case, packets from different OSPFv3 sessions may preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not recommended in normal cases.\nPrecautions\nTo check whether CAR for whitelisted OSPF sessions is supported on each board, run the display cpu-defend whitelist-v6 session-car ospfv3 statistics slot <slot-id> command."
