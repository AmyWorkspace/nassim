    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe number of devices increases with the network expansion, which\nleads to a large LSDB on each OSPFv3-enabled device on a large-scale\nnetwork. Consequently, route flapping frequently occurs, and a large\nnumber of OSPFv3 packets are transmitted on the network, which wastes\nbandwidth resources. OSPFv3 addresses the preceding problem by logically\npartitioning an AS into different areas."
