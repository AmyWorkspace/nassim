    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOSPFv3 can automatically calculate the link cost for an interface based on the interface bandwidth. You can also set the link cost for the interface using the ospfv3 cost commands.\nPrerequisites\nOSPFv3 has been enabled using the ospfv3 area command in the interface view.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe ospfv3 cost command cannot be run on null interfaces.\nPrecautions\nIf no cost is set for an OSPFv3 interface using the ospfv3 cost command, OSPFv3 automatically calculates its cost based on the interface bandwidth. The calculation formula is as follows: Cost of the interface = Bandwidth reference value/Interface bandwidth. The integer of the calculated result is the cost of the interface. If the calculated result is smaller than 1, the cost is 1. Changing the bandwidth reference value can change the cost of an interface."
