In addition, the smaller value between min-rx-interval set on the local end and min-tx-interval set on the remote end is used as min-tx-interval of the remote end. If the local end does not receive any BFD packets within the interval of x (local detection multiplier), it declares the remote end Down.\nPrecautions\nAfter BFD is enabled, OSPFv3 establishes BFD sessions only with the neighbors in the Full state.\nThe preference of BFD configured on an interface is higher than that configured in the process.\nThe bfd all-interfaces (OSPFv3) command and the ospfv3 bfd block command are mutually exclusive."
