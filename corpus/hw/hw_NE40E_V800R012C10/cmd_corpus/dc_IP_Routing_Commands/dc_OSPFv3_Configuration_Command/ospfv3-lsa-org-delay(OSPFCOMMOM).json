    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf no flapping occurs among the OSPFv3 LSAs to be sent, the configuration of the lsa-originate-interval command prevents the device from frequently sending LSAs. If the OSPFv3 LSAs to be sent flap, the configuration of the lsa-originate-interval suppress-flapping command minimizes the impact of the flapping on services. The larger value of the two intervals specified in the commands is used as the suppression period.\nThe suppression mechanism takes effect based on the following rules:\nFlapping detection: OSPFv3 starts a flapping counter. If the interval between two OSPFv3 LSAs that are sent successively is less than or equal to 10s, OSPFv3 records a flapping event and increases the flapping_count by 1.Suppression phase: If the flapping_count is greater than or equal to threshold, flapping suppression takes effect.Suppression exit: If the interval between two OSPFv3 LSAs that are sent successively is greater than 10s, OSPFv3 resets the flapping_count and exits from suppression."
