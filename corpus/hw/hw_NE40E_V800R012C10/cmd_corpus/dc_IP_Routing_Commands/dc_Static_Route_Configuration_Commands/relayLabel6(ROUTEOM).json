    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA route needs recursion if its next hop is unreachable. To allow IPv6 routes to recurse to remotely leaked VPN routes, run the ipv6 route recursive-lookup inherit-label-route enable command. After the command is run, IPv6 routes inherit the labels and Tunnel IDs of the remotely leaked VPN routes, which ensures correct traffic forwarding. This command mainly applies to BGP/MPLS IPv6 VPN scenarios. For configurations details, see Configuration-BGP/MPLS IPv6 VPN Configuration-Configuring IPv6 Route Recursion to Remotely Leaked VPN Routes."
