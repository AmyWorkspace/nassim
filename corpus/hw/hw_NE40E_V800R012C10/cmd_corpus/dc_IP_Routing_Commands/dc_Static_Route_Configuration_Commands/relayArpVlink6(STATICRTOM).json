    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a scenario where a Layer 2 VPN accesses a Layer 3 VPN, to configure a device to recurse static routes to ARP Vlink routes, run the ipv6 route-static command with recursive-lookup host-route specified and IPv6 route recursive-lookup arp vlink-direct-route protocol static.\nIf a Layer 2 link fails, for example, the physical interface of a Layer 2 device fails, traffic can be switched to the backup path immediately, preventing traffic loss caused by a black-hole route.\nPrecautions\nAfter the ipv6 route recursive-lookup arp vlink-direct-route protocol static command is run, all IPv6 static routes can recurse to ARP Vlink routes. After the undo ipv6 route recursive-lookup arp vlink-direct-route protocol static command is run, IPv6 static routes cannot recurse to ARP Vlink routes."
