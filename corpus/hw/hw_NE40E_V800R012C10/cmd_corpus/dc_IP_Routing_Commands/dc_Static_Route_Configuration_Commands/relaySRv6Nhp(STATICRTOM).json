    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an L3VPNv4 HoVPN over SRv6 BE or L3VPNv4 HoVPN over SRv6 TE Policy scenario, if the next hop of a default static route on the SPE is the SPE itself and the link between the SPE and the NPE fails, the UPE cannot detect the link fault. As a result, a traffic black hole occurs after traffic reaches the SPE. To resolve this problem, you need to specify the NPE's address as the next-hop address of the default static route on the SPE. In this manner, the validity of the static route depends on whether the link between the SPE and NPE is available. If the link fails, the default static route on the SPE becomes inactive. In addition, you need to run the ip route-static recursive-lookup inherit-label-route segment-routing-ipv6 command to enable the SPE to recurse static routes to SRv6 routes. This configuration allows the SPE to withdraw this inactive route when the SPE-NPE link fails so that the UPE can detect the route withdrawal and no longer sends traffic to the SPE, thereby preventing a traffic black hole."
