    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA route needs recursion if its next hop is unreachable. To allow routes to recurse to remotely leaked VPN routes, run the ip route recursive-lookup inherit-label-route enable command. After the command is run, routes inherit the labels and Tunnel IDs of the remotely leaked VPN routes, which ensures correct traffic forwarding. This command mainly applies to BGP/MPLS IP VPN scenarios. For configurations details, see Configuration-BGP/MPLS IP VPN Configuration-Configuring Route Recursion to Remotely Leaked VPN Routes."
