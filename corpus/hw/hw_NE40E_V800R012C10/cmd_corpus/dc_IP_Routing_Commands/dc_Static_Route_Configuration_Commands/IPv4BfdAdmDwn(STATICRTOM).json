    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, a static route can still be selected by Huawei devices even though the BFD session associated with it is in the AdminDown state, but not by non-Huawei devices. As a result, Huawei devices cannot interwork with non-Huawei devices.\nTo address this problem, run the ip route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid command to configure the Router not to select the static route if the BFD session associated with it is in the AdminDown state.\nPrerequisites\nThe BFD session has been created.\nPrecautions\nThe undo ip route-static track bfd-session admindown invalid command enables all static routes to be selected by the Router even though the BFD sessions associated with them are in the AdminDown state."
