    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prevent a routing loop when GGSN services are being forwarded between boards, run the ip route-static selection-rule relay-depth command to configure static routes to be selected based on recursion depths.\nImplementation Procedure\nUse the ip route-static selection-rule relay-depth command.The static routes with the same prefix have the same priority but different recursion depths. The static route module selects the static route with the smallest recursion depth as the active route and sends it to the RM.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIn the system, some static routes have the same prefix and priority but different recursion depths. After static routes are configured to be selected based on recursion depths, the static route module selects the static route with smallest recursion depth as the active route and adds it to the RM. Other static routes become inactive.\nPrecautions\nThe routes whose recursion depth is greater than 10 are inactive.\nAfter recursion depth-based static route selection is configured, the load balancing result may change because load balancing cannot be implemented among static routes with different recursion depths."
