    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, devices discard all RIPng packets with a non-zero MBZ field.\nTo allow a Huawei device to communicate with a non-Huawei device that can send RIPng packets with a non-zero MBZ field, run the undo checkzero command on the Huawei device.\nIf all neighbors are trustworthy, run the undo checkzero command to disable the check on the MBZ field to save CPU resources.\nPrecautions\nIf the RIPng packets with a non-zero MBZ field need to be discarded, do not disable the check on the MBZ field."
