    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure RIPng-related parameters, run the ripng command to create a RIPng process first.\nRIPng supports multi-process. Multiple RIPng processes can run on the same device, independent of each other. Route exchange between different RIPng processes is similar to route exchange between different routing protocols.\nPrecautions\nIf a VPN instance is specified for a RIPng process, the RIPng process is associated with this VPN instance; otherwise, the RIPng process is associated with the public network instance. A VPN instance can be specified for an existing RIPng process only.\nIf the undo ripng command is run, all configurations in the RIPng process are deleted. Therefore, exercise caution when using the command."
