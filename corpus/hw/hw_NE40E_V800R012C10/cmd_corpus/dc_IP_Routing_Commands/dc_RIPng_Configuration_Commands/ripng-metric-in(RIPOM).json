    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf there are multiple routes that perform load balancing and are destined for the same destination in the routing table, you can run the ripng metricin command to change the route metric locally. After the command is run, the routing entries in the routing table change accordingly.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen an interface receives a route, RIPng adds the interface metric to the route, and then adds the route to the routing table. Therefore, increasing the interface metric also increases the metric of the RIPng route received by the interface."
