    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf no VPN instance is specified, the RIP process is run in the global or default instance. RIP must be started first so that global RIP parameters can be configured. However, the configurations of interface-related parameters are not restricted.\nIf the undo rip process-id command is run, all configurations in the RIP process are deleted. Therefore, exercise caution when using the command.\nPrecautions\nRIP packets can be sent only when the interface MTU is greater than or equal to 52 bytes."
