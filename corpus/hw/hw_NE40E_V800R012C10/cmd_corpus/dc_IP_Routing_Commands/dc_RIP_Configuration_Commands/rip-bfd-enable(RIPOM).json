    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAs technologies develop, voice, video, and other video on demand (VoD) services are widely applied. These services are sensitive to packet loss and delay. RIP-capable devices detect neighbor status by exchanging Update packets periodically. By default, a local device cannot detect a link failure until 180s after the link failure occurs. During this period, carriers or users may suffer the loss of a large number of packets. To address this problem, configure BFD.\nThe bfd all-interfaces enable command enables BFD for RIP, which speeds up fault detection and route convergence.\nPrerequisites\nBefore running this command, ensure the following operations have been performed:\nGlobal BFD has been enabled using the bfd command.A RIP process has been created and the RIP view has been displayed using the rip command.\n\nPrecautions\nThe BFD priority set using the rip bfd enable command in the interface view is higher than the one set using the bfd all-interfaces enable command.\nIf the rip bfd block command has been run on a RIP-capable interface, the bfd all-interfaces enable command does not take effect. In this situation, run the rip bfd enable command to enable BFD."
