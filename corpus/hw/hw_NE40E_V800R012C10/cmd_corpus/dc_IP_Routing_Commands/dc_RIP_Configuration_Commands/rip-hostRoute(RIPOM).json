    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, after receiving a RIP-1 route, the device selects the mask according to the following rules:\nIf the IP address carried in the received RIP-1 route and the IP address of the interface that receives the RIP-1 route belong to the same network segment, the mask of the RIP-1 route is that of the interface.If the IP address carried in the received RIP-1 route and the IP address of the interface that receives the RIP-1 route belong to different network segments, the mask of the RIP-1 route is a natural mask.\nAfter the host-route command is run, if the IP address carried in the received RIP-1 route and the IP address of the interface that receives the RIP-1 route belong to the same network segment, the mask carried in the RIP-1 route is adopted.\n\nPrecautions\nThis command applies to RIP-1. In RIP-2, host routes are added to the routing table, regardless of whether the command is run."
