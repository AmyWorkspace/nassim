    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe versions of request and response packets vary with the configured RIP version.\nIf the version of RIP is not set, a device sends RIP-1 packets in broadcast mode and receives the RIP-1 and RIP-2 packets that are sent in broadcast mode.If the RIP version is set to RIP-2, a device sends only RIP-2 packets in multicast mode and receives RIP-2 packets that are sent in multicast or broadcast mode.If the RIP version is set to broadcast RIP-2, a device sends RIP-2 packets in broadcast mode and receives RIP-1 and RIP-2 packets.\n\nPrecautions\nYou can also set a RIP version in a RIP process, but the RIP version that is set on an interface has a higher priority."
