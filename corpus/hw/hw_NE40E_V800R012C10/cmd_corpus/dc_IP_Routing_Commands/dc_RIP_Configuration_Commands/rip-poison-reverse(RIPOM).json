    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPoison reverse allows a RIP-enabled interface to set the cost of the route that it learns from a neighbor to 16 (indicating that the route is unreachable) and then send the route back. After receiving this route, the neighbor deletes the useless route from its routing table, which prevents loops. To enable poison reverse for RIP update packets, run the rip poison-reverse command.\nPrecautions\nWhen split horizon and poison reverse are both configured, only poison reverse takes effect."
