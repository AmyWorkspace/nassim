    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a device running RIP is connected to a network running other routing protocols, run the rip output command on the interface that connects the device to the network to prevent the interface from sending useless packets to the network.\nPrecautions\nThe silent-interface command that is run in a RIP process takes precedence over the rip input or rip output command that is run on an interface. By default, an interface does not work in the silent state."
