    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a device running RIP is connected to a network running other routing protocols, you can run the rip input command on the interface that connects the device to the network to prevent the interface from receiving useless packets from the network.\nImplementation Procedure\nThe silent-interface command that is run in a RIP process takes precedence over the rip input or rip output command that is run on an interface."
