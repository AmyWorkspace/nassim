    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a device running RIP is connected to a network running other routing protocols, you can run the silent-interface command on the interface that connects the device to the network to prevent the interface from sending useless packets to the network.\nYou can run the silent-interface and peer (RIP) commands to advertise routes to a specified device.\nPrecautions\nThe silent-interface command that is run in a RIP process takes precedence over the rip input or rip output command that is run on an interface.\nIf the undo silent-interface all command has been run in the current process, running the silent-interface all command causes the undo silent-interface command all configuration to be deleted. As a result, the RIP neighbor relationship established using the interface specified in the undo silent-interface all command goes down."
