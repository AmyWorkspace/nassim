    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe versions of request and response packets vary with the configured RIP version.\nIf the RIP version is set to RIP-2, a device sends only RIP-2 packets in multicast mode and receives RIP-2 packets that are sent in multicast or broadcast mode.If the RIP version is set to multicast RIP-2, a device sends RIP-2 packets in multicast mode and receives RIP-2 packets that are sent in multicast mode.\n\nPrecautions\nYou can also set a RIP version in a RIP process, but the RIP version that is set on an interface has a higher priority."
