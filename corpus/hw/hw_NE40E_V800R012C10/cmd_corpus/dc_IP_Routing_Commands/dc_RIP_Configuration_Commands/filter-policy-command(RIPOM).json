    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf you want to delete an interface-based export policy, specify interface-type interface-number. Export policies can be deleted from only one interface each time. The command is configured in the RIP process. If you want to filter routes based on an interface or a protocol, you can configure only one export policy for the interface or protocol. If no interface or protocol is specified, the configured export policy takes effect globally. You can configure only one export policy each time.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
