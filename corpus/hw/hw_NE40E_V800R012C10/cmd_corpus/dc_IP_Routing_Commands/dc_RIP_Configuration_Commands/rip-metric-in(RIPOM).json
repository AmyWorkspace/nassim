    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an interface receives a route, RIP adds the interface metric to the route, and then adds the route to the routing table. Therefore, increasing the interface metric also increases the metric of RIP routes received by the interface.\nYou can specify the metric to be added to the RIP routes that match the ACL or IP prefix list by specifying . If a RIP route fails to match the ACL or IP prefix list, the metric is not added to the route.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the metric of a route is greater than 16 after the configured value is added, 16 is used as its metric.\nIf the route is unreachable after the rip metricin command is run, run the undo rip metricin command to restore the default value."
