    ],
    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the check on the MBZ field, run the checkzero command. The command is valid only for RIP-1 packets because there are no MBZ field in RIP-2 packets.\nConfiguration Impact\nBy default, devices discard all RIP-1 packets with a non-zero MBZ field.\nTo allow a Huawei device to communicate with a non-Huawei device that can send RIP-1 packets with a non-zero MBZ field, run the undo checkzero command on the Huawei device. However, exercise caution when running the command because it may decrease security."
