    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter source IP address verification is enabled, a device checks the source address of each packet received by an interface to determine whether the source IP address and the IP address of the interface are in the same subnet. The packets from a different subnet are denied by the device.\nDo not disable source IP address verification in normal cases."
