    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSplit horizon prevents a RIP-enabled interface from sending back the routes it learns, which reduces bandwidth consumption and prevents routing loops. To enable split horizon for RIP update packets, run the rip split-horizon command.\nDo not disable split horizon for RIP update packets.\nPrecautions\nWhen split horizon and poison reverse are both configured, only poison reverse takes effect."
