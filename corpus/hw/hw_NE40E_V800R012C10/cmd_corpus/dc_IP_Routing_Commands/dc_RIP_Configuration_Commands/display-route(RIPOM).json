    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo check information about all the activated and deactivated RIP routes that are learned from other devices and the values of the timers associated with each RIP route, run the display rip route command. You can specify different parameters to view information about the specified routes.\nBy viewing routing information, you can learn key information carried in routes, which helps debug and detect protocols. When a route becomes inactive, you can check the Aging, Suppressed, or Garbage-collect field to learn the route status and the time during which the route remains in a specific state."
