    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the EMDI detection solution detects only the packet loss rate and packet disorder rate. In some scenarios, the jitter indicator also needs to be detected. To enable jitter detection, run the emdi rtp-jitter enable command.\nPrecautions\nOn some specified network, after jitter detection is enabled, the jitter along with the packet loss rate and packet disorder rate are periodically sent to the uTraffic. On other network, after jitter detection is enabled, a device detects the jitter indicator but does not report the detection indicator data to the uTraffic."
