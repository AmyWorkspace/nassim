    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a device deployed with the EMDI detection solution detects that the packet disorder rate and packet loss rate of various video streams exceed the specified thresholds, the device reports an alarm to the NMS. To configure the alarm thresholds of the packet loss rate and packet disorder rate for various video sources (SD, HD, and 4K), run the emdi alarm threshold command.\nBy default, the alarm thresholds corresponding to various EMDI monitoring periods are as follows:\nMonitoring Period\n\nThreshold of Packet Loss Rate (SD)\n\nThreshold of Packet Loss Rate (HD)\n\nThreshold of Packet Loss Rate (4K)\n\nThreshold of Packet Disorder Rate (SD)\n\nThreshold of Packet Disorder Rate (HD)\n\nThreshold of Packet Disorder Rate (4K)\n\n\n\n60s\n\n38\n\n9\n\n3\n\n38\n\n9\n\n3\n\n\n30s\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n\n10s\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen a detection indicator equals to the configured alarm threshold, an alarm is generated.\nPrecautions\nWhen the monitoring period has been changed using the emdi monitor-period command, the alarm thresholds are automatically changed to the default values corresponding to the new monitoring period."
