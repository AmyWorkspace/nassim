    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn the NG-MVPN, if the transit and bud nodes overlap, two pieces of traffic will be detected on the same node, causing offset in the detection results of the packet loss rate, packet disorder rate, and jitter. To avoid detection offset when the transit and bud nodes overlap and ensure the accuracy of detection results, run the emdi monitor-rate-only command to enable EMDI detection only on the rate of video streams that pass through the node instead of the packet loss rate, packet disorder rate, and jitter."
