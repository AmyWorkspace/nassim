    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the downstream EMDI detection solution is used, after the EMDI channels and boards to be detected are configured and the EMDI channel group is bound to the EMDI board group, run the emdi channel outbound command to bind an EMDI channel to the outbound interface to detect indicators of the EMDI channel in the downstream direction.\nPrerequisites\nAn EMDI channel group has been created using the emdi channel-group command. An EMDI board group has been created using the emdi lpu-group command. The EMDI channel group has been bound to the EMDI board group using the emdi bind channel-group lpu-group outbound command.\nPrecautions\nAn EMDI channel can be bound to only one interface on a board. A maximum of 20 EMDI channels can be bound to an interface."
