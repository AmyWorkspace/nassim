After an EMDI channel group has been created using the emdi channel-group command, run the emdi channel command to add a specified multicast channel to the EMDI channel group to complete configuration of the EMDI detection channel.\nPrerequisites\nAn EMDI channel group has been created using the emdi channel-group command.\nPrecautions\nDifferent channels cannot be configured with the same channel name.A channel can be configured only in one channel group.In IPTV scenarios, the default value of <pt-value> is 33.When multicast channels are configured for uncompressed streams, the uncompressed parameter is mandatory."
