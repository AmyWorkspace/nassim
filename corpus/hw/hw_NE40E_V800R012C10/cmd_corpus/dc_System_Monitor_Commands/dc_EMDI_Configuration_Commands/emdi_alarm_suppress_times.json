    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo ensure the accuracy of EMDI alarm reporting, run the emdi alarm suppress times command to configure the number of EMDI alarm suppression times so that an alarm is reported to the NMS only after an indicator reaches the alarm threshold for the specified times.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the number of EMDI alarm suppression times is configured, an alarm is reported to the NMS only after an indicator reaches the alarm threshold for the specified times.\nFor example, after the emdi alarm suppress times command has been run to configure the alarm threshold of the packet loss rate for SD video streams as 1/10000 and the number of alarm suppression times is configured as 4, an alarm is reported to the NMS only when the packet loss rate of SD video streams reaches 1/10000 for four times."
