    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the telco cloud VXLAN scenario, a probe packet with the same 5-tuple information as that of the service flow is constructed on the ingress node and is added with a special DSCP value for the devices through which the service flow passes to identify. This helps restore the device path through which the service flow passes.\nThis command is used to enable DSCP-based IPv4 or IPv6 path detection.\nPrecautions\nThe path detection function can detect only the traffic path between any two devices in the VXLAN tunnel scenario.Before using DSCP-based path detection, plan an unoccupied DSCP value that will be used to identify detection packets."
