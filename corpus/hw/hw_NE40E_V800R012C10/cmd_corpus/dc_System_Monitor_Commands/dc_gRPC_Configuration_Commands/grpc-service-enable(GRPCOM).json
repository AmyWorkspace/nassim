    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a collector functioning as a client initiates a connection to a device functioning as a server, the data sampled is dynamically subscribed to. In this case, you need to enable the gRPC IPv4 service on the server.\nPrerequisites\nThe gRPC IPv4 service listens to a specified source IP address. Therefore, before enabling the gRPC IPv4 service, you must run the source-ip command to configure a source IPv4 address to be listened.\nPrecautions\nTo delete a configured source IPv4 address in the gRPC server view, ensure that the gRPC IPv4 service is disabled."
