    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a collector functioning as a client initiates a connection to a device functioning as a server, the data sampled is dynamically subscribed to. In this case, you can run the idle-timeout command to configure an idle timeout period for the gRPC IPv6 service. If no RPC connection is established before the idle timeout period expires, the gRPC IPv6 service is disconnected and waits for the client to connect to the server again."
