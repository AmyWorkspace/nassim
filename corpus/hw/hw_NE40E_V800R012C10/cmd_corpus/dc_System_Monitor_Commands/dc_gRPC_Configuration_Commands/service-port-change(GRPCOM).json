    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a collector functioning as a client initiates a connection to a device functioning as a IPv4 server, the data sampled is dynamically subscribed to. In this case, you can run the server-port command to configure a server port to be listened. A connection can then be established between the server and client."
