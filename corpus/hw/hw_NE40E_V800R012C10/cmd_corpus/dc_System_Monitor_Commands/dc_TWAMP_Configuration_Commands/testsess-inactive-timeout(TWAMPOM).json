    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA test session is started based on a control session. After the session-reflector is configured, the session-reflector can reply to the session-sender with probes carrying timestamps and serial numbers. Upon receiving response probes, the session-sender calculates the IP performance statistics based on the timestamps and serial numbers and sends the result to the client. The control-client collects statistics and provides them for users.\nIf a test session stays in the inactive state within the specified inactive interval, the test session is deleted to reduce resource consumption."
