    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTwo-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) uses the client/server mode.\nThe client creates, starts, and ends a test session and generates and maintains statistics indicating the IP link performance.The server responds to the client's request for establishing, starting, or stopping a test session and responds to probes.After the nqa twamp command displays the TWAMP view, you can run the server command to enable the server function.\nCurrently a Huawei device can function only as the server. To implement TWAMP, ensure that devices that can function as the client exist on the network.\n\nPrecautions\nThe undo server command deletes all configurations of a server."
