    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTwo-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) uses the client/server mode and defines four logical entities, the server, client, session-sender, and session-reflector. Control signals are transmitted between the client and server, and probes are transmitted between the session-sender and session-reflector. After the session-reflector is configured, the session-reflector can reply to the session-sender with timestamps and serial numbers to help collect statistics about the delay, jitter, and packet loss rate.\nCurrently a Huawei device can function only as the session-reflector. To implement TWAMP, ensure that devices that can function as the session-sender exist on the network.\nPrecautions\nThe undo reflector command deletes all configurations of a session-reflector."
