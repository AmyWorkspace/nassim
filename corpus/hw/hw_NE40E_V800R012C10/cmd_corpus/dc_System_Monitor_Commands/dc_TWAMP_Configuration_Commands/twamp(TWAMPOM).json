    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAs networks rapidly develop, various services are deployed to meet requirements in different scenarios. Therefore, networks encounter increasingly higher requirements for statistics collection. A tool that rapidly provides statistics on the IP network performance is urgently needed.\nTraditionally, network elements (NEs) individually generate and maintain statistics on their IP network performance. To display performance statistics for the entire network, a network management system (NMS) is required to manage multiple NEs and collect statistics about these NEs. However, there may be no NMS deployed, or the NMS may be incapable of collecting statistics.\nTWAMP is introduced so that NEs no longer need to generate or maintain statistics on IP network performance. The performance management system manages only the TWAMP client and easily obtains statistics for the entire network. Therefore, TWAMP applies to the scenario in which statistics on the IP network performance must be quickly obtained but not necessarily be highly accurate.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the nqa twamp command is used to enable the TWAMP function, the TWAMP function does not take effect if no relevant configuration exists in the TWAMP view.\nPrecautions\nThe undo nqa twamp command deletes all configurations in the TWAMP view."
