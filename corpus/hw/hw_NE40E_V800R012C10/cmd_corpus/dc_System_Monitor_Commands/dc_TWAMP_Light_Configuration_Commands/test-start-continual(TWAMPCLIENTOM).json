To implement performance measurement continuously, run the test start-continual command to enable proactive measurement.\nPrerequisites\nA session has been created on the Control-Client.\nPrecautions\nAfter a test session is deleted, the proactive measurement configuration for the test session will be deleted.After a Session-Sender is deleted, all proactive measurement configurations will be deleted.When on-demand measurement is running, if proactive measurement is started, on-demand measurement is immediately stopped, and proactive measurement starts to work.On-demand measurement may fail when board resources are insufficient. If the display twamp-light test-session command output shows inactive in the State option, on-demand measurement fails."
