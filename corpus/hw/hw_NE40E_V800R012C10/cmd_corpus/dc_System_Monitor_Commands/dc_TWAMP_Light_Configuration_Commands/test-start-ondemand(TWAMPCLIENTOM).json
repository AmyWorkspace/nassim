    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn-demand measurement works in a specified period after being triggered. It can be performed once in the specified period. To implement performance measurement once, run the test start command to enable on-demand measurement. On-demand measurement automatically stops after the specified period elapses or the number of sent packets reaches the specified threshold.\nPrecautions\nOn-demand measurement fails in any of the following situations:\nOn-demand measurement is started when proactive measurement is running.On-demand measurement is started when board resources are insufficient. If the display twamp-light test-session command output shows inactive in the State option, on-demand measurement fails."
