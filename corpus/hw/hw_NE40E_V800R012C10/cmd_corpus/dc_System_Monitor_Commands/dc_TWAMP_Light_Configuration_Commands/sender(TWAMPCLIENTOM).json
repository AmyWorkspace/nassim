    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo start a TWAMP Light statistical service, run the sender command to create a TWAMP Light Session-Sender.\nPrecautions\nA TWAMP Light session must be created on the Control-Client where TWAMP Light statistics are to be collected.After a Session-Sender is deleted, only proactive measurement is stopped. On-demand measurement automatically stops after required statistics are collected.To configure TWAMP Light, you must configure the Responder and then the Controller. If only the Controller is configured, the Responder sends a large number of TWAMP Light packets received from the Controller to the LDM, and responds to the Controller with a large number of ICMP packets."
