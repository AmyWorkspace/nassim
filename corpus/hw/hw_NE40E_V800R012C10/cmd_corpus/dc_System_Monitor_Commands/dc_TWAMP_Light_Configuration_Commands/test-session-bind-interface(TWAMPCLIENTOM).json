    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo bind an interface to a TWAMP Light test session, run the test-session bind interface command. After an interface is bound to a TWAMP Light test session and TWAMP Light discovers valid statistics, TWAMP Light advertises the statistics (including the remote IP address, maximum delay, minimum delay, and average delay) to the interface. Other functional modules can use these statistics to implement more service applications. For example, an IGP can obtain the statistics from the interface and report them to the Controller for path computation. In this case, the outbound interface of the route needs to be bound to the test session.\nPrerequisites\nA TWAMP Light test session has been created.\nPrecautions\nThe TWAMP Light test session can be of the IPv4 or IPv6 type.\nTWAMP Light advertises test statistics to the bound interface after discovering valid statistics only when the test start-continual or test start twamp-regular command is configured.\nA TWAMP Light test session can be bound to only one interface, and an interface is bound to a maximum of one IPv4 test session and one IPv6 test session."
