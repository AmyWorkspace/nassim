    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMultiple filter criteria can be configured for the same filter of a sampling path. The final filter criteria can be determined only after logical operations are performed between these filter criteria. To perform logical operations between multiple filter criteria, you must run the condition-relation command to configure a logical operation mode between these filter criteria.\nPrerequisites\nA filter has been created using the filter command."
