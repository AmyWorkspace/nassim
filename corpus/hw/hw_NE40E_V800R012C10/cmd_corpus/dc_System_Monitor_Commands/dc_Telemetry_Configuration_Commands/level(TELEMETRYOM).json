    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo ensure normal network and service running, specify a customized threshold for a performance indicator of a resource object that telemetry monitors, and configure a customized event. If the performance indicator exceeds the customized threshold, the system automatically reports the customized event to the collector for service policy determination.\nTo specify a level for a customized event, run the level command. You can define the meaning of level-value. For example, the larger the level value, the greater the impact of the event. After the level of a customized event is configured, the data packet sent to the collector contains the level value when the customized event is reported. You can determine the severity of the event based on the level value and take measures accordingly."
