    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen telemetry collects data, the main control board's CPU is consumed. When the CPU usage reaches a certain percentage, other services may be affected. To prevent other services from being affected, run the cpu-usage max-percent command to configure a maximum usage for the main control board's CPU used when telemetry collects data. If the CPU usage exceeds the configured maximum usage, telemetry stops sending sampled data. After the CPU usage falls below the maximum usage, telemetry continues to send sampled data.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
