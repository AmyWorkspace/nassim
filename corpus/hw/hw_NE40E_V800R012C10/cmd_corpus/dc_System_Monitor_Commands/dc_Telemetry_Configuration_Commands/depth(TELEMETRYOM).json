    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter configuring a sampling path on a device, you can run the depth command to configure a sampling depth for the sampling path. The device collects data of some or all nodes in the path based on the sampling depth.\nIf the sampling depth is set to 1, only the data of the specified path is sampled.If the sampling depth is set to 2, the data of the specified path and all its child nodes is sampled.If the sampling path depth is set to 3, the data of the specified path and all its child and grandchild nodes is sampled."
