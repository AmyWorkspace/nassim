    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen configuring a sampling path, you can specify filter criteria so that the data that meets the filter criteria can be collected and reported. Filter criteria can be configured only in the filter view. Therefore, before configuring filter criteria, run the filter command to create a filter and enter the filter view.\nPrecautions\nOnly one filter can be configured for a sampling path.\nIf a sampling sensor group has been subscribed to and the sensor-group command has been run in the subscription view to configure a heartbeat interval or redundancy suppression, no filter can be configured for sampling paths in the sampling sensor group."
