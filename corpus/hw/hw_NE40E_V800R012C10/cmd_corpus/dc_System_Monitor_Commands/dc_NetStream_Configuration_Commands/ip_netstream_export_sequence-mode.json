    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNetStream packets can be exported in the V5, V8, V9, or IPFIX format. NetStream packets exported in the V5 or V8 format carry the flow sequence field, recording the sequence number of flows; NetStream packets exported in the V9 format carry the packet sequence field, recording the sequence number of packets. The command apply to the V9 format only. To configure NetStream packets to carry the flow sequence field, run the ip netstream export sequence-mode command."
