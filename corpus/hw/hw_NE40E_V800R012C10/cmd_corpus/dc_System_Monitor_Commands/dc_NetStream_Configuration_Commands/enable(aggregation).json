    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOriginal flow statistics are used to analyze sampled packets. Various types of original flows sharing characteristics can be aggregated into an aggregated flow. An aggregated flow has less data volume and shared characteristics, which meets requirements of feature-based statistics collection.\nAfter creating an IPv4 or IPv6 NetStream aggregation mode using the ip netstream aggregation or ipv6 netstream aggregation command in the system view, you must run the enable command in the aggregation view to make the aggregation mode take effect."
