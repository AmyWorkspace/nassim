    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the number of NetStream sampling IDs configured on the device exceeds the total number of assignable sampling IDs, the sampling result may be inaccurate or the sampling function does not take effect. As a result, traffic-based accounting settlement is affected. For proper planning, run the display ip netstream sampler-id allocated-info command to view sampling ID allocation information on all interface boards."
