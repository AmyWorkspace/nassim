    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn NDE samples data traffic and sends the sampled data to an NSC for processing. To specify the NSC IP address to which the NDE outputs sampled data, run this command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe destination IP address configured in the NetStream aggregation view is for aggregated NetStream flows. The destination IP configured in the slot view is for original NetStream flows. The destination IP address configured in the system view is for both original and aggregated NetStream flows. The destination IP address configured in the NetStream monitoring view is for original NetStream flows.\nFor aggregated flows, the destination IP address configured in the NetStream aggregation view takes precedence over that configured in the system view. If no destination IP address is configured in the NetStream aggregation view, the destination IP address configured in the system view is used.\nFor original flows, the destination IP address configured in the slot view takes precedence over that configured in the system view. If no destination IP address is configured in the slot view, the destination IP address configured in the system view is used. When destination IP address configured in the slot view,\nIf a destination IP address is configured in the slot view rather than the monitoring view, but the monitoring service is deployed on the associated interface, template packets are output to the destination IP address configured in the slot view.If two different destination IP addresses are respectively configured in the slot and monitoring views, and the monitoring service is deployed on the associated interface, template packets are output to the destination IP addresses configured in the netstream monitoring view.\n\nPrecautions\nIn the system view or slot view, if IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are not distinguished, each of the ip netstream export host and ipv6 netstream export host commands supports the configuration of eight output addresses. In the IPv4 NetStream aggregation view, the ip netstream export host command supports the configuration of eight output addresses. In the IPv6 NetStream aggregation view, the ipv6 netstream export host command supports the configuration of eight output addresses.In real-world applications, the destination IP address of NetStream traffic statistics can be set to either a public or private address, but the source IP address can be set only to a public address.VSn has no slot view. Therefore, the output address configured in the slot view of the admin-VS takes effect in VSn.\nWhen running the command in the slot view, you must run this command on the NetStream service processing board. The destination IP address configured on other boards does not take effect.\nThe output of NetStream packets to the NSC is through the service interface not through the management interface."
