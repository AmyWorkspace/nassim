To check whether NetStream configurations performed in views can meet the requirement, run the display netstream command.\nThe display netstream configuration command output displays NetStream configurations that exist in each view. If the NetStream function is not configured, the display netstream command output is null.\nPrecautions\nWhen the aggregation mode is configured but is not enabled, display netstream all fails to display the aggregation mode."
