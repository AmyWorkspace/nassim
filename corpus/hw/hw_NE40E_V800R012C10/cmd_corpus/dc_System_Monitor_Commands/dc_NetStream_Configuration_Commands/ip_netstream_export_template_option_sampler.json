    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOption packets are exported in V9 or IPFIX format. Therefore, the NetStream Data Exporter (NDE) must send a matching option template to the NetStream Collector (NSC) so that the NMS can properly parse option packets. After the NetStream sends packet statistics to the NSC, the NSC must analyze and store the statistics in sampling mode. To enable the function of exporting interface option packet statistics, such as the interface sampling mode, sampling ratio, sampling direction, and index, to an NSC server, run the ip netstream export template option sampler command or ipv6 netstream export template option sampler command.\nAt present, interface option packet statistics that can be exported are interface sampling parameters, the index of the interface where NetStream is enabled, and the interface direction. System option packet statistics that can be exported are system sampling parameters and the ID of the slot where NetStream sampling is enabled.\nPrerequisites\nIf the ip netstream export source and ip netstream export host commands are not run in the system view before you run the ip netstream export template option sampler command, the system does not automatically output option statistics, and you cannot view the statistics increase using the display ip netstream export template option command.If the ipv6 netstream export source and ipv6 netstream export host commands are not run in the system view before you run the ipv6 netstream export template option sampler command, the system does not automatically output option statistics, and you cannot view the statistics increase using the display ipv6 netstream export template option command."
