            "Info": "Specifies the interval at which the output template is refreshed. Generally, the higher the network traffic volume is, the smaller the template refresh interval should be set, but the volume of the network traffic generated for sending the template also increases. In a similar manner, the lower the network traffic volume is, the greater the template refresh interval should be set, but the volume of the network traffic generated for sending the template decreases. Therefore, set a proper template refresh interval. The default value is recommended.\nThe value is an integer ranging from 1 to 3600, in minutes. The default value is 30."

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNetStream aggregated flows can be output in V8, V9 or IPFIX format. When NetStream aggregated flows are output in the V9 or IPFIX format, a corresponding output template needs to be output for the NMS to parse the received aggregated flows. Output templates for parsing different flows vary. Therefore, the NDE needs to periodically send aggregation templates to the NMS."
