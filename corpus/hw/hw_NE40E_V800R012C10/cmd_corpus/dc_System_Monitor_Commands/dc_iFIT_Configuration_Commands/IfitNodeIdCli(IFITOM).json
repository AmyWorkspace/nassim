To ensure that a unique network-wide flow ID is generated, run the node-id command to set a node ID.\nPrerequisites\niFIT has been globally enabled using the ifit command.\nPrecautions\nnode-id can be modified only after all iFIT instances are deleted.\nThe node IDs configured for devices cannot be the same"
