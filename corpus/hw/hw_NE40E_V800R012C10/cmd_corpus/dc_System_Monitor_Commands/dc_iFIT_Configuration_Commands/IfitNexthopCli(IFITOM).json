    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore using iFIT, you must run the encapsulation nexthop command to enable a device to encapsulate the iFIT header in packets destined for a specified next hop IP address.\nIf there are multiple next hops, you can repeat this command.\nPrecautions\nBefore running the encapsulation nexthop command, ensure that the corresponding next hop has the capability of removing the iFIT header. Otherwise, traffic forwarding on the next hop is affected."
