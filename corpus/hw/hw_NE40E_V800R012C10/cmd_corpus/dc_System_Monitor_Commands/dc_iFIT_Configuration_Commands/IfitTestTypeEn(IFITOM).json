    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\niFIT measurement results serve as a reliable reference for assessing IP network performance and therefore are useful for fault diagnosis and service statistics. To measure the packet loss rate and delay on the entire network, run the measure-mode e2e command to set end-to-end measurement. To accurately obtain the packet loss rate and delay of each network node, run the measure-mode trace command to set hop-by-hop measurement.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
