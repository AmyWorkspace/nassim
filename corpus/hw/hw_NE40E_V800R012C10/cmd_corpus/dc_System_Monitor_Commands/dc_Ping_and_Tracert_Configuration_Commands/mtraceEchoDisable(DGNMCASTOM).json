    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a fault occurs on a multicast network, run the mtrace command to check network connectivity. The mtrace command mainly has the following uses:\nThe mtrace command can be used in multicast troubleshooting and routine maintenance to locate a faulty device and reduce  configuration errors.It can be used to collect traffic statistics in path tracing and calculate the multicast traffic rate in cyclic path tracing.The NMS analyzes faulty device information displayed in the mtrace command output and generates alarms.\nYou can run the mtrace echo disable command to disable a device from responding to MTrace request and query messages for management or security purposes.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the mtrace echo disable command is run, a device discards MTrace request and query messages. As a result, MTrace detection is terminated on this device.\nPrecautions\nAfter the undo mtrace echo disable command is run, a device records MTrace request and query message statistics. Therefore, you are advised to run the reset mtrace statistics command to clear the original statistics before running the mtrace command. This ensures that the statistics recorded are correct."
