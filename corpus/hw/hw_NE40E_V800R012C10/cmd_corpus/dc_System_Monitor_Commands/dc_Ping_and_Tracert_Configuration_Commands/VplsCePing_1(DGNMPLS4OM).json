You must specify different source MAC addresses for different devices.The source MAC address for CE ping must not be used by an interface.\nBy default, the system automatically selects one MAC address from 16 MAC addresses for CE ping as the source MAC address and encapsulates it into a packet. The system may not select different MAC addresses for different devices.

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo check the connectivity between the PE on an MPLS network and the CE in a specified BD in EVC scenarios, run the ce-ping bd command on the PE. The PE broadcasts CE Ping packets to the specified BD to request the destination CE's MAC address. If the PE can receive a response packet from the CE, the CE is reachable.\nPrecautions\nWhen you specify a source IP address, note the following points:\nThe source IP address must be on the same network segment as the CE's IP address. If they are on different network segments, the CE considers received CE pings invalid and discards them.The source IP address must be an unused IP address in the specified BD. If you specify a used IP address for the source IP address, CE Ping packets cannot be properly forwarded. As a result, the user using the source IP address cannot access the Internet. If you specify a gateway IP address for the source IP address, all users cannot access the Internet.\nTo avoid this problem, do not specify a used IP address for the source IP address."
