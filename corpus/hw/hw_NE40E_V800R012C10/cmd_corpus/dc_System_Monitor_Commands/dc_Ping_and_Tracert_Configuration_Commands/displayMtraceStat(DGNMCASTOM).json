    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a fault occurs on a multicast network, you can run the mtrace command to check network connectivity.\nIf network connectivity is abnormal or you need to view information about IGMP messages sent and received by devices on the multicast network, run the display mtrace statistics command.\nThe\nmtrace and\ndisplay mtrace statistics command output helps locate a faulty network device. The detailed process is as follows:\nRun the display mtrace statistics command on the initiator. The number of query messages sent must be the same as that of response messages sent.Run the mtrace command on the initiator. If the multicast path is not detected, run the display mtrace statistics command on the initiator to check whether response messages are replied.Run the display mtrace statistics command on an intermediate device and check whether there are request messages sent or received. If no such messages exist, the intermediate device is faulty.\n\nPrecautions\nBefore running the display mtrace statistics command to collect MTrace message statistics generated in a certain period, you need to run the reset mtrace statistics command to clear the original statistics."
