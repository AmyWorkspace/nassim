    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an SRv6 TE Policy network, if data forwarding fails over the SRv6 TE Policy, the control plane for SRv6 establishment cannot detect this failure, making network maintenance difficult. The SRv6 TE Policy ping mechanism can be used to detect such faults and locate faulty nodes. This mechanism is implemented using the ping srv6-te policy command. To test the connectivity of an SRv6 TE Policy, run the ping srv6-te policy command.\nPrerequisites\nSRv6 has been enabled on the device and is working properly.\nPrecautions\nIf the segment list changes during the SRv6 TE Policy ping test, the ping results may be inaccurate. It is recommended that you press Ctrl+C to stop and then re-initiate a ping operation.\nIf the IPv6 router ID is not specified, a source IPv6 address need to be configured manually when running this command."
