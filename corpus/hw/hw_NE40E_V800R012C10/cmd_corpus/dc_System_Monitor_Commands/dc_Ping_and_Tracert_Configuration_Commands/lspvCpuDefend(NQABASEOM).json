    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAs NQA is deployed on the main control board of a device, both the initiator and responder of an LSP ping test need to send LSP ping test packets to the main control board for processing. If a large number of packets are sent to the main control board, the CPU usage of the main control board increases, which adversely affects device operation. To prevent this problem, run the lspv mpls-lsp-ping cpu-defend command to set an upper limit for the rate of sending MPLS echo request packets to the main control board.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the number of MPLS echo request packets sent to the main control board exceeds the specified upper limit, excess packets will be discarded."
