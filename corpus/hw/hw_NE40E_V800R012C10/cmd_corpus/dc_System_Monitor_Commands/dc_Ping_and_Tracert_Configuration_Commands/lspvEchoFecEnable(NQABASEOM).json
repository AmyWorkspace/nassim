    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe tracert lsp command is used to check the fault point on a network, which facilitates fault diagnosis. This command uses MPLS echo request and MPLS echo reply packets to detect LSP connectivity.\nWhen a Huawei device interworks with a non-Huawei device, if the Huawei device initiates a tracert lsp test, you can properly check the fault location on the network. If the non-Huawei device initiates a tracert lsp test and the Huawei device responds with an MPLS echo reply packet carrying FEC information, the non-Huawei device fails to identify the FEC information and therefore discards this packet, causing a test failure. To control the packet format and enable the device to respond to MPLS echo request packets with MPLS echo reply packets that do not carry FEC information, run the lspv echo-reply compitable fec enable command.\nPrerequisites\nThe lspv mpls-lsp-ping echo enable command has been run in the system view to enable the device to respond to MPLS echo request packets before you run this command."
