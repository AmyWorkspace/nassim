    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network with GMAC trace enabled, the source device does not need to be a MEP, and the intermediate or destination device does not need to be a MEP or MIP. In other words, GMAC trace can be implemented without the need to configure an MD, MA, or a MEP on the source, intermediate, or destination device. The only requirement is to enable all intermediate devices to reply with LTRs.\nIf devices between PEs are interconnected through a L2VPN,\nWhen packets received by PEs carry double tags, use the QinQ tag termination sub-interface that is bound to the L2VC/VSI to access the L2VPN. If you need to determine connectivity between PEs, specify the parameter pe-vid and ce-vid.When packets received by PEs carry one tag, use the Dot1q tag termination sub-interface that is bound to the L2VC/VSI to access the L2VPN. If you need to determine connectivity between PEs, specify the parameter dot1q-vlan vlan-id.When the destination of GMAC trace is the MAC address of the device, Ingress Port is the name of the interface where the PW resides and the ingress MAC address is the MAC address of the device.\nThe MAC address specified in the general MAC ping must be the physical MAC address of the physical interface in the Layer 2 scenario.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe GMAC ping function has been enabled using the trace mac enable command.\nPrecautions\nThe two devices must be enabled with 802.1ag of the same version."
