    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure the maximum length of sFlow packet payload, run the sflow max-packet-length command. Increasing the maximum length of sFlow packet payload reduces the number of sFlow packets that can be sent. However, when the length of an sFlow packet (packet payload length + packet header length) exceeds the MTU, the packet is fragmented. You are advised to increase the maximum length of sFlow packets within the MTU range.\nPrecautions\nIPv6 sFlow packets do not support fragmentation. Note that the maximum length of sFlow packets cannot exceed the MTU of an outbound interface."
