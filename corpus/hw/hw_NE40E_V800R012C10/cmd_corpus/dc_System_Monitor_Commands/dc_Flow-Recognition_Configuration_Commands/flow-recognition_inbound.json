    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable flow recognition on an interface, run the flow-recognition inbound command. After the command is run, the device collects the septuple information (source and destination MAC addresses, source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port numbers, and protocol type) of the upstream traffic on the interface, and identifies a flow based on the information. The device then sends the flow's statistics such as the numbers of packets and bytes to a controller.\nPrerequisites\nEnter the interface view.\nPrecautions\nFlow recognition does not support port extension services.Flow recognition is mutually exclusive with sFlow/NetStream/ESQM/QoS-NetStream/ACL-log on a board."
