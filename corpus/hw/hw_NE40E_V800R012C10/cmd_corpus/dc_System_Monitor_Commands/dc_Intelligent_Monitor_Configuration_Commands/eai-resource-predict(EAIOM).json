    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the intelligent resource trend prediction function is enabled, the system periodically detects the resource trend component and predicts the trend for 40 days, and checks whether the preset threshold will be crossed in the next 40 days under the current trend. The threshold is set to 80%. If the threshold is exceeded, an alarm is reported to the customer. When the alarm clearance condition is met, the alarm is cleared.\nPrecautions\nIf you run this command to configure intelligent resource trend prediction function on an unsupported chassis, a message is displayed indicating that the function is not supported.Intelligent resource trend prediction function is supported only on devices equipped with main control boards with a memory capacity of 4 GB or higher. If you run this command to configure intelligent resource trend prediction function on an unsupported device, a message is displayed indicating that the function is not supported.If you run this command to configure intelligent resource trend prediction function on a device whose main control boards do not meet CPU performance requirements, a message is displayed indicating that the function is not supported."
