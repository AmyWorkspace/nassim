    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn IP FPM statistical period is an interval between when a TLP counts the number of packets or bytes and when the TLP records the send and receive timestamps. The period can be set to 10s, 60s, or 600s. By default, the IP FPM statistical period is 10s.\nTo configure the one-way delay alarm threshold and its clear alarm threshold, run the delay-measure one-way delay-threshold command. The conditions for alarm generation are as follows:\nIf the one-way delay for five statistical periods exceeds the configured upper-limit, the hwIpfpmOneDelayExceed alarm is generated, and the link fault occurrence is notified in real time.If the one-way delay for five statistical periods falls below the configured lower-limit, the hwIpfpmOneDelayRecovery alarm is generated, and the link fault rectification is notified in real time.\nTo help network operation and maintenance, run the delay-measure one-way delay-threshold command based on network performance requirements.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the delay-measure one-way delay-threshold command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nThe delay-measure one-way delay-threshold command only configures the thresholds. The system generates a one-way delay alarm or its clear alarm only when the one-way delay alarm or its clear alarm function is enabled and the one-way delay for five statistical periods reaches the configured alarm threshold or falls below the configured clear alarm threshold."
