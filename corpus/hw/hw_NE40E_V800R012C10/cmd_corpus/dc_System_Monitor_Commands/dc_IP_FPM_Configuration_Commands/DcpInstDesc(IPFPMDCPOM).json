Configuring the description for an IP FPM instance is recommended in the following situations:\nMany IP FPM instances are configured, and their functions cannot be clearly identified.An IP FPM instance is used at a long interval, and its function may be left forgotten.\n\nPrecautions\nIf an IP FPM instance is configured but does not have a description, it may be misused."
