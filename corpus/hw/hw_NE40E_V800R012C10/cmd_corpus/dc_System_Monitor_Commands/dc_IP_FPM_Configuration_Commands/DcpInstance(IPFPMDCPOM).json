    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo implement IP FPM performance statistics on a specified service flow, run the instance command to create an IP FPM instance. Each IP FPM instance is composed of a target flow, TLPs, and a statistical period.\nPrerequisites\nThe nqa ipfpm dcp command has been run to enable DCP globally.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the following commands to configure parameters for the configured IP FPM instance.\nRun the flow command to configure target flow characteristics.Run the tlp command to configure a TLP.Run the interval command to configure the statistical period.\n\nPrecautions\nThe IP FPM instance ID must be unique on an MCP and all its associated DCPs.\nAn MCP and all its associated DCPs must have the same IP FPM instance configured. Otherwise, statistics collection does not take effect."
