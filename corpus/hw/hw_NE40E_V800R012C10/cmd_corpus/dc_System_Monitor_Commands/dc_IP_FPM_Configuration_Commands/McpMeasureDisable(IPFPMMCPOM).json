    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen DCP configurations are being changed, the MCP may receive incorrect statistics from the DCP. To prevent this, run the measure disable command to disable IP FPM performance statistics collection of a specified instance on the MCP. After the DCP configuration change is complete, run the undo measure disable or measure enable command to enable IP FPM performance statistics collection for the specified instance on the MCP. This ensures accurate measurement."
