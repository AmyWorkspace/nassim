The MCP ID specified for an IP FPM instance on a DCP must be the same as that specified in the mcp id command run on the MCP associated with this DCP.\nThe UDP port number configured on the DCP must be the same as that configured in the protocol udp port command run on the MCP associated with this DCP. Otherwise, the DCP cannot report the statistics to the MCP."
