    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allow communication between an MCP and a DCP, run the dcp id command to configure a DCP ID. After the DCP receives the statistics for an IP FPM instance from TLPs, the DCP encapsulates the statistics and the DCP ID to packets and sends the packets with the DCP ID set to the source IP address. After the MCP receives the packets, it compares the DCP ID carried in the packets with that configured in the dcp command run on itself.\nIf the two DCP IDs are the same, the MCP accepts the packets and summarizes and calculates the statistics.If the two DCP IDs are different, the MCP considers the packets invalid and discards them.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe nqa ipfpm dcp command has been run to enable DCP globally.\nPrecautions\nThe DCP ID configured in an IP FPM instance must be the same as that specified in the dcp command run on an MCP. Otherwise, the MCP associated with this DCP cannot process the statistics reported by the DCP"
