An MCP and its associated DCPs must have the same authentication mode and password configured. The MCP processes packets only from the authenticated DCPs.\nPrerequisites\nThe nqa ipfpm mcp command has been run to enable MCP globally.\nPrecautions\nThe authentication mode and password configured on an MCP must be the same as those configured on the DCPs associated with this MCP. Otherwise, the MCP cannot process the statistics reported by the DCPs."
