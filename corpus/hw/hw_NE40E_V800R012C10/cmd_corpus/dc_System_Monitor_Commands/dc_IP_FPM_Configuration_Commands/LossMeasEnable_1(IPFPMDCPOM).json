    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe IP FPM performance statistics serve as a reliable reference for assessing IP network performance and therefore are useful for fault diagnosis and service statistics. To diagnose network faults and locate faulty nodes when network performance deteriorates, run the loss-measure enable mid-point command.\nPrerequisites\nAn IP FPM model has been established, including configuring a DCP and MCP, binding a TLP to a physical interface, and creating a target flow and IP FPM instance.\nPrecautions\nIf a master/slave switchover is performed, or the device is restarted, packet loss measurement on a mid-point will become invalid. You must reconfigure the function."
