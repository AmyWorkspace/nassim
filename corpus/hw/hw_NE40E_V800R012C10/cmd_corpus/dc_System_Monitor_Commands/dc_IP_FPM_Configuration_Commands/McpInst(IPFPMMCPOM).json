    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo implement IP FPM performance statistics on a specified service flow, run the instance command to create an IP FPM instance. Each IP FPM instance is composed of a target flow, TLPs, and a statistical period.\nPrerequisites\nThe nqa ipfpm mcp command has been run to enable MCP globally.\nPrecautions\nThe IP FPM instance ID must be unique on an MCP and all its associated DCPs.\nAn MCP and all its associated DCPs must have the same IP FPM instance configured. Otherwise, statistics collection does not take effect."
