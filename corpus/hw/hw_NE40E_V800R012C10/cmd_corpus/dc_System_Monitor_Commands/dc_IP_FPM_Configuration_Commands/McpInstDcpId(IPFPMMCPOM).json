    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn IP FPM instance contains one or more DCPs. To specify DCP IDs for an IP FPM instance after it is created on an MCP, run the dcp command so that the MCP can determine whether the statistics are reported from authenticated DCPs.\nPrerequisites\nThe instance command has been run to configure an IP FPM instance on an MCP.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf dcp-id is not specified, the undo dcp command deletes all DCP IDs from a specified IP FPM instance on an MCP.\nPrecautions\nThe DCP ID specified for an IP FPM instance on an MCP must be the same as that configured in the dcp id command on a DCP."
