    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allow communication between an MCP and a DCP, run the mcp id command to configure an MCP ID. After the DCP receives the statistics for an IP FPM instance from TLPs, the DCP encapsulates the statistics and the MCP ID specified by the mcp command run in the IP FPM instance to packets and sends the packets to the destination IP address identified by the MCP ID. After the MCP receives the packets, it compares the MCP ID carried in the packets with that configured in the mcp id command run on itself.\nIf the two MCP IDs are the same, the MCP accepts the packets and summarizes and calculates the statistics.If the two MCP IDs are different, the MCP considers the packets invalid and discards them.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe nqa ipfpm mcp command has been run to enable MCP globally.\nPrecautions\nThe MCP ID must be an IP address reachable to the DCPs. The MCP ID configured on an MCP must be the same as that specified in the mcp command run in the IP FPM instance view of all DCPs associated with this MCP. If an MCP ID is changed on an MCP, it must be changed for all DCPs associated with this MCP in an IP FPM instance. Otherwise, the MCP cannot process the statistics reported by the DCPs."
