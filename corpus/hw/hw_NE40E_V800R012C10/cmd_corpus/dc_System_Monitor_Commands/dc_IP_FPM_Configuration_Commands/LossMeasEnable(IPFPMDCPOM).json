    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe IP FPM performance statistics serve as a reliable reference for assessing IP network performance and therefore are useful for fault diagnosis and service statistics.\nTo monitor on-demand packet loss performance in a specified period, run the loss-measure enable command.To detect faults when network performance deteriorates and monitor proactive packet loss performance, run the loss-measure enable continual command.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn IP FPM model has been established, including configuring a DCP and MCP, binding a TLP to a physical interface, and creating a target flow and IP FPM instance.\nPrecautions\nAfter a master/slave main control board switchover or a device restart, on-demand packet loss measurement does not take effect any longer.\nOn-demand packet loss measurement cannot function together with proactive packet loss measurement."
