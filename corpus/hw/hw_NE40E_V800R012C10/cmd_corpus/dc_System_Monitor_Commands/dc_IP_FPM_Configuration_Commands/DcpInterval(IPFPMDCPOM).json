    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo implement IP FPM performance statistics and ensure measurement accuracy, run the interval command to configure a statistical period based on the clock offset, maximum transmission delay, and system performance.\nThe statistical period of an IP FPM instance is a period of time from when TLPs measure the number of packets or bytes to when DCPs report the statistics to an MCP and the MCP calculates the measurement result. The shorter the statistical period, the more frequent DCPs report the statistics to the MCP, and the more statistics the DCPs and MCP will process. Therefore, the statistical period change will affect the system performance of the DCPs and MCP.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the statistical period of an IP FPM instance is changed, it must be changed for all DCPs of this IP FPM instance. Otherwise, statistics collection does not take effect.\nPrecautions\nBefore you change the statistical period of an IP FPM instance, disable packet loss or delay measurement in the instance view."
