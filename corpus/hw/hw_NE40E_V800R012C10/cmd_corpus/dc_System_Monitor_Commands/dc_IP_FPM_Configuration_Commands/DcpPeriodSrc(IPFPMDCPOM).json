    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo ensure accurate IP FPM delay measurement, IP FPM-deployed devices must have the same clock source.\nIn P2MP (MP being two points) delay measurement scenarios, if the ingress of the service traffic uses NTP as the clock source, but the egresses use a different clock source, for example, NTP or 1588v2, you must configure the egresses to select NTP as the clock source when calculating an IP FPM statistical period ID to ensure consistent clock sources on the ingress and egresses.\nTo configure a DCP to select NTP as the clock source when calculating an IP FPM statistical period ID, run the period source ntp command."
