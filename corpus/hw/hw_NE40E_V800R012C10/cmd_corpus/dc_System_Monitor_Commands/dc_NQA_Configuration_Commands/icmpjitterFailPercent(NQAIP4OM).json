    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA test consists of several probes. On an unreliable network, the probe-count command can be used to set the number of probes for an NQA test instance. The analysis on statistics about probe packets helps you monitor network quality.\nSome or all sent probe packets may be discarded. In this case, you can run the fail-percent command to set the failure percent threshold. When the number of failed probes reaches the specified percent threshold, the test is considered failed.\nFor example, 10 probes are set using the probe-count command, and seven probes fail.\nIf the failure percent threshold is set to 80, the probe failure percentage (70%) is lower than 80%, and therefore, the test instance is successful.If the failure percent threshold is set to 60, the probe failure percentage (70%) is higher than 60%, and therefore, the test instance fails.\n\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
