    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the ping mac-8021ag or trace mac-8021ag command is run to test the network connectivity or rectify a network fault, run the display cfm statistics lblt command to check 802.1ag packet statistics. Performing such tests for multiple times generates a lot of test packet statistics, adversely affecting test result analysis. To clear 802.1ag packet statistics, run the reset cfm statistics lblt command. You can also clear useless 802.1ag packet statistics before performing a test, so that the display cfm statistics lblt command displays the packet statistics of only the current test."
