    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA bandwidth profile defines SLA service flow parameters, including the CIR and EIR.\nA bandwidth profile must be specified for an Ethernet service activation test. Only after the bandwidth profile is specified, an initiator can construct and send test packets. Upon receipt of the test packets, the reflector calculates parameters, compares them with those in the bandwidth profile, and then determines whether the test is successful and whether the carrier network service deployment and network resources meet requirements for the tested services.\nPrecautions\nThis command is only run for an Ethernet service activation test instance."
