    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo specify a test type of an NQA LSP test instance, run the lsp-type command so that the test instance can monitor the connectivity of an LDP LSP or a TE tunnel.\nIf ipv4 is configured, the NQA test instance monitors the connectivity of a specified LDP LSP. The destination address of the test instance is configured using the destination-address command.If te is configured, the NQA test instance monitors the connectivity of a TE tunnel. The destination address of the test instance is configured using the lsp-tetunnel command.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn LSP test instance has been configured.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
