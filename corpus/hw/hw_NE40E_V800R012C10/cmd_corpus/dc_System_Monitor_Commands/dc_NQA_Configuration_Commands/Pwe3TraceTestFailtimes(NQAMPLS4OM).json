Once this threshold is reached, a trap is sent to the NMS.\nThe undo test-failtimes command restores the default threshold for the number of consecutive failures of an NQA test instance.\nBy default, an NQA test instance sends a trap message for each test failure.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA probe is a process in which a probe packet is sent in a test.\nMultiple packets can be sent in a test. That is, a test can contain several probes. By default, a test is considered as a success if one or more probes in the test succeed; a test is considered failed if all probes in the test fail.\nAfter the test-failtimes command is executed for an NQA test instance, traps will be sent only when send-trap is enabled.\nPrecautions\nIf you change a TTL propagation mode for the local PE during the running of a test instance, the system displays a message, asking you whether to stop the test instance. You can press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the system stops the test instance and changes the PW ID for the local PE. After you run the commit command, the change takes effect. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the TTL propagation mode fails to be modified."
