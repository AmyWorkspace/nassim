    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure Echo Request packets to be sent through an IP FRR bypass LSP, run the path-type bypass command. Normally, in an ICMP test instance, service traffic is sent through the primary LSP on an IP network configured with IP FRR LSPs. If the primary LSP is faulty, service traffic is switched to the bypass LSP for forwarding before route convergence. As the existing detection mechanism cannot cover the forwarding entries of a bypass LSP, the system fails to detect the fault in the primary LSP, causing service interruptions. Therefore, a detection mechanism that covers the forwarding entries of a bypass LSP is required so that you can detect forwarding entry problems of the bypass LSP."
