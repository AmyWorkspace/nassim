    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an NQA test instance starts, it will send multiple probe packets in each test. Network quality is checked by the data collected through multiple probe packets.\nIn actual situations, interference in the network can cause a probe failure. However, a single probe failure does not indicate the failure of the whole. A probe failure can be judged by setting one in ten thousands ratio for NQA test failures. A probe failure will be defined if failed probe packets of the total reach a certain ratio.\nPrerequisites\nThe type of NQA test instance has been configured as generalflow.\nPrecautions\nYou cannot change the test failure ratio of a running test instance."
