    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set delay thresholds after NQA is configured, run the threshold rtd command.\nThe conditions for alarm generation are as follows:\nIf the round-trip delay exceeds the parameter thresholdRtd, the nqaJitterStatsRTDThresholdNotification alarm is generated.If the round-trip delay is less than the parameter thresholdRtd, the round-trip delay is within an allowable range, and no alarm is generated.\n\nPrerequisites\nBefore using the threshold rtd command, run the test-type command to specify a test type.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
