    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prevent endless running of a test instance, age the test instance periodically. The agetime command can be used to set the aging time to change the survival time of a test instance in the system.\nThe aging time is started when the NQA test instance is in the inactive state. When the aging time expires, the system deletes the NQA test instance automatically.The aging time is reset when the NQA test instance is in the active state.\n\nPrerequisites\nBefore using the agetime command, run the test-type command to specify a test instance type.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
