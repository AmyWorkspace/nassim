    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the reply mode for an NQA LSP test instance, run the lsp-replymode command.\nBy default, a UDP packet is used to respond to an NQA test request. If no-reply is configured, the destination will send no packet for response. In most cases, no-reply is configured when NQA test packets received on the destination are used only for statistics collection or other applications.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf no-reply is configured, the NQA test instance will fail because it receives no reply packet.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
