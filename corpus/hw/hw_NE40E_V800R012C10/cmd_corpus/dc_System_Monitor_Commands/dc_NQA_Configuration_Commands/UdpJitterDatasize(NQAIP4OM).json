    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe datasize command sets the size of the data field in a test packet. This ensures that the size of the test packet is closer to the size of the actual data packet and the statistics obtained is more accurate.\nFor example, if a UDP jitter test instance is used to detect VoIP services, you can run the datasize command to set the size of the data field in a test packet to have the same size as the actual voice packet so as to simulate the actual traffic in a period of time.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the commands jitter-codec and datasize have been run to set the packet size, running the datasize command again overrides the previous configuration.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
