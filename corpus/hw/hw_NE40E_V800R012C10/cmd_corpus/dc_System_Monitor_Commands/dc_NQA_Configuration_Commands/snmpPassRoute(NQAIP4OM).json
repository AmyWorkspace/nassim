    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an NQA test instance to send packets without searching the routing table, run the sendpacket passroute command.\nThe sendpacket passroute command is applicable to the following scenarios:\nNo source IP address is set.\nIf no outbound interface is configured for an NQA test instance, after the sendpacket passroute command is run, the source IP address of packets to be sent in the test is obtained using an internal algorithm.If an outbound interface is configured for an NQA test instance, after the sendpacket passroute command is run, the IP address of the outbound interface is used as the source IP address of packets to be sent in the test.\nA source IP address is set.\nIf no outbound interface is configured for an NQA test instance, after the sendpacket passroute command is run, the specified source IP address is used as the source IP address of packets to be sent in the test.If an outbound interface is configured for an NQA test instance, after the sendpacket passroute command is run, the specified source IP address is used as the source IP address of packets to be sent in the test.\n\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
