    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA read community name uniquely identifies a community, a collection of the NMS and SNMP agents, and is used for communication authentication. The NMS and SNMP agents can communicate only if they have the same read community name. To configure an SNMP test instance to carry a read community name in NQA packets, run the community read cipher command.\nIf a target SNMP agent runs SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the read community name specified in the community read cipher command must be the same as the read community name configured on the SNMP agent. Otherwise, the SNMP test will fail.\nPrerequisites\nAn SNMP test instance has been configured using the nqa and test-type commands."
