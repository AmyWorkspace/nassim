    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn path MTU detection, to prevent packet fragmentation, run the set-df command. By increasing the packet size, the path MTU is obtained.\nYou can check the path MTU by using a trace test instance as follows:\nRun the set-df command to disable packet fragmentation. Then, run the datasize command to set the size of the packet data area. After that, start the test instance. If the test is successful, the size of the sent packet's data area is smaller than the path MTU. Then, keep increasing the packet data area size using the datasize command until the test fails. If the test fails, the size of the sent packet's data area is greater than the path MTU."
