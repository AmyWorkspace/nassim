    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo perform an NQA VPLS PW ping test, run the local-pw-id command to configure a PW ID for the local PE. The PW ID must be the same as the PW ID for the remote PE.\nPrecautions\nIf you change a PW ID for the local PE during the running of a test instance, the system displays a message, asking you whether to stop the test instance. You can press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the system stops the test instance and changes the PW ID for the local PE. After you run the commit command, the change takes effect. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the PW ID fails to be modified."
