You can press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the system stops the test instance and changes the PW ID for the local PE. After you run the commit command, the change takes effect. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the PW ID fails to be modified."
