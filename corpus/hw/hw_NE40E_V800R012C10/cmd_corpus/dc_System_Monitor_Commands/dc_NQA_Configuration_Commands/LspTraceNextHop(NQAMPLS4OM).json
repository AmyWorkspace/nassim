    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen load balancing is enabled on an ingress, run the lsp-nexthop command to specify a next hop IP address. After the configuration is complete, packets are transmitted in the specified direction.\nPrecautions\nIf you change an IP address for the local PE during the running of a test instance, the system displays a message, asking you whether to stop the test instance. You can press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the system stops the test instance and changes the PW ID for the local PE. After you run the commit command, the change takes effect. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the IP address fails to be modified.\nYou cannot configure the next hop IP address for a test instance which is testing."
