    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA DNS test instance detects the speed at which a DNS name is resolved to an IP address. It clearly reflects the performance of the DNS protocol on the network.\nPrerequisites\nThe NQA test instance type has been set to DNS test using the test-type command.\nPrecautions\nIf you change the DNS server IP address during the running of a test instance, the system displays a message, asking you whether to stop the test instance. You can press Y or N as required.\nIf you press Y, the system stops the test instance and changes the DNS server IP address. After you run the commit command, the change takes effect. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press N, the change fails and the test instance keeps running."
