    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nToS is an 8-bit field in the IP header. To set the ToS value for NQA test packets, run the tos command .\nBy configuring ToS, you can apply policy-based routing or CAR to test packets.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the ToS value has been set for packets in a test instance, running the tos command again overrides the previous configuration.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
