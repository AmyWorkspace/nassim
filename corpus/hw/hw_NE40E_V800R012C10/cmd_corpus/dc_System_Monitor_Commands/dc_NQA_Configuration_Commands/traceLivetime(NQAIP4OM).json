    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the minimum and maximum lifetime of a test instance, run the tracert-livetime command. This prevents endless traveling of test packets in routing on the network.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen configuring first-ttl and max-ttl, ensure that max-ttl is not smaller than max-ttl; otherwise, the configuration fails.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
