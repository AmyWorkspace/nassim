    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe SAC describes network service quality that a carrier promises before rolling out network services. The SAC consists of network performance parameters, such as the FLR, FTD, and FDV.\nThe SAC must be specified for an Ethernet service activation test. The initiator calculates these counters (including FLR, FTD, and FDV) based on received packets, compares these counters with configured ones, and determines whether test flow tests are successful, and network service quality meets the requirements.\nPrecautions\nThis command is only run for an Ethernet service activation test instance."
