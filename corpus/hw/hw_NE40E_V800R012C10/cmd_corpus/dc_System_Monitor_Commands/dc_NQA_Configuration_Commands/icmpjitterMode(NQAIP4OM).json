    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set an ICMP jitter test mode, run the icmp-jitter-mode command. The command output includes the date and time when the destination received ICMP packets.\nIf the peer device can respond to the ICMP timestamp packets, use the icmp-timestamp mode so that accurate test results can be displayed.\nPrerequisites\nThe icmp-jitter-mode command is applicable to ICMP jitter test instances.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf an ICMP jitter test mode is already specified, running the icmp-jitter-mode command overrides the configured mode.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
