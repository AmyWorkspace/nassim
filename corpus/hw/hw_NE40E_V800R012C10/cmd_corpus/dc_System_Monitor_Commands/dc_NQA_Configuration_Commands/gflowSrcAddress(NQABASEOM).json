    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure the source IP/MAC address of a test instance, run the source-address command. When test packets arrive at the destination address, the receive end returns reply packets to the configured source IP/MAC address.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the specified source IP address is not the IP address of the device that sends test packets, no reply packet will be received.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified.\nThe same test instance can be assigned only one source address, and the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nIf a source MAC address is configured to initiate an NQA generalflow test, MAC entry learning on the reflector will be affected."
