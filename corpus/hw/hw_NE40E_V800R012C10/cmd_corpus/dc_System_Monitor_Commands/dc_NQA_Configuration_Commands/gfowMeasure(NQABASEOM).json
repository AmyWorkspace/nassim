    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure the counter of a generalflow test instance, run the measure command. The following counters can be used:\nThroughput: maximum number of bits that can be sent along a link every second. The value is expressed in kbit/s.Packet loss ratio: percentage of discarded packets to all sent packets.Delay: time elapsed when a test packet is sent and returned. The value is expressed in microseconds.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe measure command can only be used for generalflow test instances.\nFollow-up Procedure\nConfigure other test parameters in specific test scenarios.\nPrecautions\nYou cannot change this configuration of a running test instance."
