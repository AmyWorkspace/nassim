    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMAC, IP, or both MAC and IP addresses are specified based on traffic types:\nFor Ethernet Layer 2 switching and L2VPN services, a MAC address must be specified, and an IP address is optional.For IP routing and L3VPN services, an IP address and a MAC address must be specified. If no IP address or MAC address is specified, the reflector will reflect all the traffic, which affects other service functions.For L2VPN accessing L3VPN, both MAC and IP addresses must be specified.\n\nPrecautions\nFor the same test flow, a range can be specified only in one of the traffic-type, vlan, pe-vid, udp destination-port, and udp source-port commands. In addition, the difference between the start and end values cannot be more than 127, and the end value must be greater than the start value.\nIn the traffic-type command, the start MAC or IP address has only one different octet from the end MAC or IP address. For example, the start IP address is set to 1.1.1.1, and the end IP address can only be set to an IP address in the network segment 1.1.1.0."
