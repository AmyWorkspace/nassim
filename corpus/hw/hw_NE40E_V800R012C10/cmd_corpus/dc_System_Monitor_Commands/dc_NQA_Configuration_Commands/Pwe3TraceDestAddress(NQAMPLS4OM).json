    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNQA monitors service features by creating test instances. In NQA, two test ends are called an NQA client and an NQA server. An NQA test is initiated by the NQA client. After test instances are configured on the client, NQA places different types of test instances into various test queues. After the test starts, a response packet is returned. You can then check the operating status about protocols by analyzing the received response packet.\nFor a test instance, the server is specified using the destination IP address configured using the destination-address command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a destination IP address has been configured for a test instance, running the destination-address command overrides the previous configuration.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
