    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn unreliable networks, to set the number of probes for an NQA test instance, run the probe-count command. Then, you can monitor network quality by analyzing the probe statistics.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the number of probes has been configured for an NQA test instance, running the probe-count command again overrides the previous configuration.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
