    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA MAC ping test is performed between a MEP and a Merge Point (MP) to detect network connectivity between the two nodes. The test is initiated by the MEP and the destination node can be either a MEP or a MIP with the same level as the MEP, no matter whether the two nodes are in the same maintenance association (MA). Be sure to specify the local MEP ID before starting a MAC ping test.\nBefore you specify the mep-id parameter, ensure that an MEP has been created using the mep mep-id command.The mep command applies only to MAC ping tests."
