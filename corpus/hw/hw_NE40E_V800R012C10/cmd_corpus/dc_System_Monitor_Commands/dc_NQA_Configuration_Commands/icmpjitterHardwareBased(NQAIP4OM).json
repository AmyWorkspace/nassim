    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen ICMP Jitter test are performed, the hardware forwarding engine on the interface board needs to be enabled to send packets and timestamp. In this case, you need to configure the hardware-based enable.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the hardware-based enable command is run, the sendpacket passroute command can be configured but does not take effect."
