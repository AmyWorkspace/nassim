    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo implement interworking with non-Huawei devices in MS-PW scenarios, run the sender-address command to specify a source IP address for the public network device that communicates with the remote PE. The source IP address is usually the IP address of an adjacent superstratum provider edge (SPE) or user-end provider edge (UPE).\nPrecautions\nIf you change a PW ID for the local PE during the running of a test instance, the system displays a message, asking you whether to stop the test instance. You can press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the system stops the test instance and changes the PW ID for the local PE. After you run the commit command, the change takes effect. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the PW ID fails to be modified."
