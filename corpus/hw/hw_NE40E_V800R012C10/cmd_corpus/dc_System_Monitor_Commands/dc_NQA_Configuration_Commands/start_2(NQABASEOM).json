    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRunning the restart command has the same function as running the following commands in sequence:\nRun the stop command to stop running NQA test instances. The stop command stops only the running NQA test instances (test instances in the active state).Run the start now command to start the NQA test instance immediately. For the same test instance, the start now command can be used again only after the previous configuration is complete.\nTo restart a test instance, you can use the restart command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a test instance is not complete, running the restart command causes incomplete test results.\nPrecautions\nIf a test instance is not started, running the restart command functions the same as running the start now command. Both commands start the test instance immediately."
