    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTTL is an 8-bit field in the IP header. The TTL value is decreased by 1 on each hop. When the TTL value is 0, the sender receives an ICMP Time Exceeded packet.\nThe ttl command sets the TTL value for test packets so that the test instance is performed within a specified number of hops.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the TTL value has been set for test packets, running the ttl command again overrides the previous configuration.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
