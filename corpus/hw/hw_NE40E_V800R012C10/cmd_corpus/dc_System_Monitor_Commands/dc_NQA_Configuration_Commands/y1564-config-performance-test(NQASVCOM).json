    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn Ethernet service activation test consists of configuration tests and performance tests. To specify the time a configuration test takes, run the duration configuration-test command. To specify the time a performance test takes, run the duration performance-test command.\nPrecautions\nThe configuration test period consists of times that all tests take. The tests include a 25% CIR test, a 50% CIR test, and an EIR test. The performance test period is the total time that a performance test takes."
