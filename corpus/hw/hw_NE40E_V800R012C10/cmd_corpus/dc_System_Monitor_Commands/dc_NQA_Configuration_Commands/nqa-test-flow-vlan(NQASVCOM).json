    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set a VLAN ID or a range of VLAN IDs carried in Ethernet service activation test packets, run the vlan command. The reflector can loop packets carrying the specified VLAN IDs.\nPrecautions\nFor the same test flow, a range can be specified only in one of the traffic-type, vlan, pe-vid, udp destination-port, and udp source-port commands. In addition, the difference between the start and end values cannot be more than 127, and the end value must be greater than the start value."
