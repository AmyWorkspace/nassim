    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe lsp-exp command sets the LSP EXP value in MPLS Echo Request packets of an NQA test instance.\nTest packets are added to different queues based on their LSP EXP values, which provides the following advantages:\nCongestion on the link can be preventedThe specified queue can be monitored.\n\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
