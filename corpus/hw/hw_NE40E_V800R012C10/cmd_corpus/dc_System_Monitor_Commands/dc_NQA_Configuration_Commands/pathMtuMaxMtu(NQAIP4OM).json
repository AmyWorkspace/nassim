    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the path MTU test scenario, if you want to measure the maximum detection range of the path MTU, run the discovery-pmtu-max-num command to set the maximum detection range for the path MTU test.\nPrerequisites\nThe discovery-pmtu-max command is available only for a path MTU test instance.\nPrecautions\nIf parameters need to be changed during the running of the test instance, the system prompts you whether to terminate the test instance. Press \"Y\" or \"N\" as required.\nIf you press \"Y\", the test instance is terminated and parameters changed. The changed parameters take effect after the commit command is run. To restart the test instance, run the start command.If you press \"N\", the test instance keeps running, and the parameters fail to be modified."
