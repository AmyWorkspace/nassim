Once this threshold is reached, a trap is sent to the NMS.\nThe undo description command restores the default threshold for the number of consecutive probe failures in an NQA DNS test instance.\nBy default, a trap is sent for each probe failure.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn NQA test checks whether response packets are received in a probe. If no response to a probe packet is received, the probe fails. When the number of consecutive probe failures in an NQA test instance reaches the specified threshold, a trap is sent to the NMS.\nPrerequisites\nThe type of an NQA test instance has been specified using the test-type command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the probe-failtimes command is executed, run the send-trap probefailure command to enable the system to send traps to the NMS after the number of consecutive probe failures reaches the specified threshold."
