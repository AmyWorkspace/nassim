    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn MPLS network management, the ping lsp or tracert lsp command can be used for LSP detection.\nIf the LSP detection fails, run the display lspv statistics command to view statistics about MPLS packets sent and received on the local device. If the number of MPLS packets that the local device sends is the same as the number of MPLS packets that the local device receives, but the ping or trace operation fails, the detection failure is caused by the fault of the local device, not the LSP.\nPrecautions\nBefore running the display lspv statistics command to collect LSPV statistics, run the reset lspv statistics command to delete the existing statistics."
