    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the existing IP RAN bearer solutions, a large number of dynamic signaling protocols need to run on an access ring, which imposes heavy pressure on access devices. Because a large number of devices are deployed on the access ring, configurations and maintenance consume a large amount of time and manpower. IP RAN virtual cluster access resolves these issues. To deploy IP RAN virtual cluster access on a node, run the virtual-cluster-access command to enable virtual cluster access on the node.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you globally enable virtual cluster access on a device, the device automatically establishes a virtual cluster access Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) process and globally enables Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the role master command to specify a master role for the node.Run the admin command to configure a management IP address for the node."
