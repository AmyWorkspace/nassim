    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nVirtual cluster access nodes have two roles: master and AP. A master node functions as a server and performs centralized path calculations, service provisioning, and traffic control for APs. After you enable virtual cluster access, run the role master command to specify a master role for an AGG on an IP RAN.\nPrerequisites\nVirtual cluster access has been configured using the virtual-cluster-access command.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo role master command deletes all local virtual cluster access configurations."
