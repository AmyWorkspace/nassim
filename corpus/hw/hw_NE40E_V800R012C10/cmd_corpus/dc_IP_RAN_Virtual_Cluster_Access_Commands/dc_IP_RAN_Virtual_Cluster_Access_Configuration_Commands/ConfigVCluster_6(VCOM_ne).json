    "ExtraInfo": "In virtual cluster access scenarios, when VPs are established to transmit services with high quality requirements, bit errors on VPs may cause service interruptions.\nIf the primary and backup VPs of a VP protection group are both in the excessive BER state or the backup VP fails, bit-error-triggered VP switching cannot protect traffic against bit errors, but bit-error-triggered VC switching can do so. To enable VC bit error detection, run the vc bit-error-detection command."
