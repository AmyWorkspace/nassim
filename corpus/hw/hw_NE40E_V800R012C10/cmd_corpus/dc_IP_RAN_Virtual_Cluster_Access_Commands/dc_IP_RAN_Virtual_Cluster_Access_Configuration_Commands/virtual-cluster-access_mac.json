    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe virtual-cluster-access mac command is used to change the MAC address of a virtual cluster access interface. By default, all virtual cluster access interfaces have the same MAC address. If all virtual cluster access interfaces with the same MAC address enter the same Layer 2 network, an error occurs. In this scenario, you need to change the MAC address of a virtual cluster access interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the virtual-cluster-access mac command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
