    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen multiple base stations are located on the same network segment, Remote-AP interfaces still terminate VCs on an access ring. You must bind a vBridge interface to an L3VPN instance and run the vbridge command to add Remote-AP interfaces to a vBridge broadcast domain to implement multiple VCs' access to the same L3VPN.\nPrerequisites\nThe following operations have been performed:\nRun the interface vbridge command to create a vBridge interface.Run the interface remote-ap command to create a Remote-AP interface.Run the connect-slot command to associate the Remote-AP interface with a specified slot.\n\nPrecautions\nIn the same Remote-AP interface view, the vbridge command and the mpls l2vc encapsulation command are mutually exclusive."
