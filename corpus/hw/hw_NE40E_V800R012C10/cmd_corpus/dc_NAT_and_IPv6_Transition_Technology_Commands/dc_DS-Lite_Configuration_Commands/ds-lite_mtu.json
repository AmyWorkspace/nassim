    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMTU is short for maximum transmission unit. An MTU value determines the maximum number of bytes each time a DS-Lite tunnel interface can send without fragmenting IPv6 packets on a DS-Lite device. If the size of packets exceeds the MTU supported by a transit node or a receiver CPE, the transit node or receiver CPE fragments the packets or even discards them, aggravating the network transmission load. MTU values must be correctly negotiated between devices to allow packets to successfully reach the receiver through the DS-Lite tunnel.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the size of packets is greater than the configured MTU value, the packets are broken into a great number of fragments.If the MTU is set too large, packets may be transmitted at a low speed.\n\nPrecautions\nThe MTU configured must be less than the IPv6 MTU configured on an DS-Lite interface."
