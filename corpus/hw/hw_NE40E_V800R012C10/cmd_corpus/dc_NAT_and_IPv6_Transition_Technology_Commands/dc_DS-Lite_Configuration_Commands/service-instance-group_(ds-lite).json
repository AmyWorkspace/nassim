A DS-Lite instance must be bound to a service-instance-group instance group before DS-Lite services are properly transmitted.\nPrecautions\nDS-Lite dynamic load balancing is not supported in distributed DS-Lite scenarios and is mutually exclusive with the common address pool, DS-Lite server function, and port-forwarding function.\nNAT dynamic load balancing is mutually exclusive with a common IP address pool, NAT server function, easy IP, port-forwarding, and an overloaded address pool."
