    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe hash algorithm produces results, which differs with network traffic models. An appropriate hash algorithm can be selected based on the network traffic model. To configure a hash algorithm used to implement CGN ECMP and trunk load balancing, run the ds-lite load-balance hash-arithmetic command. This command helps implement the best load balancing.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
