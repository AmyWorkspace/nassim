    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe MSS value defined in TCP specifies the length of a TCP packet to be sent without fragmentation. Two devices exchange SYN packets to negotiate the MSS value for a TCP connection to be established.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ds-lite tcp adjust-mss command is run in the DS-Lite instance view, a CGN device changes the MSS value in all TCP packets that are processed by DS-Lite. If the negotiated MSS value is greater than the configured , the negotiated MSS value is changed to the configured value. If the negotiated MSS value is smaller than the configured , the negotiated MSS value remains unchanged."
