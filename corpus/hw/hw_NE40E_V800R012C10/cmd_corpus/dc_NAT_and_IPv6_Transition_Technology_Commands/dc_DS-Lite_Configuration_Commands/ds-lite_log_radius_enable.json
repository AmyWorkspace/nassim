    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDue to the limitation on a RADIUS server, a NAT device sends RADIUS source tracing packets at a limited rate. When a log of users update port ranges simultaneously, RADIUS source tracing packets may be dropped.\nSince the NAT device ensures that source tracing packets are not dropped, when the rate at which RADIUS source tracing packets reaches a specified upper limit, the NAT device stops updating port ranges, which disables users from increasing or decreasing port ranges. As a result, system performance decreases. When a NAT device uses syslog log information to perform the source tracing function, run the undo ds-lite log radius enable command to disable the NAT device from sending RADIUS source tracing packets, which maintains system performance.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
