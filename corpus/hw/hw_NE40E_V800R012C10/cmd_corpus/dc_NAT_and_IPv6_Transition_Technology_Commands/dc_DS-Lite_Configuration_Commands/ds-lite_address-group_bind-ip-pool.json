    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA DS-Lite address pool is a collection of public IPv4 addresses. After receiving IPv4 packets sent by users, a DS-Lite device translates private IPv4 addresses carried in the IPv4 packets to public IPv4 addresses and transmits the packets to a public network. The DS-Lite address pool used in DS-Lite is determined by a specific traffic policy.\nPrerequisites\nA CGN global address pool has been configured.A DS-Lite instance has been created.\n\nPrecautions\nThe ds-lite address-group bind-ip-pool command takes effect only on the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
