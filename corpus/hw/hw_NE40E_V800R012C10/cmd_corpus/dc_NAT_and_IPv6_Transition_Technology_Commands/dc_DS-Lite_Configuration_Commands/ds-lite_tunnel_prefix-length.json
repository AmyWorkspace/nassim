    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA CPE and a DS-Lite device reside on both ends of a DS-Lite tunnel. A CPE encapsulates an IPv6 header into a user host IPv4 packet and sends the packet to the DS-Lite device. Upon receipt of the packet, the DS-Lite device identifies the tunnel based on a 128-bit source IPv6 address. When a BRAS only assigns a prefix, not an IPv6 address, to the CPE, the DS-Lite device can only use the IPv6 prefix to identify the tunnel. In this situation, run the ds-lite tunnel prefix-length command to set the length of an IPv6 address prefix on a CPE of a DS-Lite tunnel.\nIn a distributed DS-Lite scenario, a BRAS assigns an IPv6 address in the format of ND+PD to a CPE. The CPE's IPv6 prefix is assigned by the BRAS, and the interface ID is determined by the CPE itself. Therefore, the DS-Lite device can only use the prefix to identify the tunnel.\nPrecautions\nThe configured IPv6 prefix must be in the same length as the IPv6 prefix that the BRAS assigns to the CPE."
