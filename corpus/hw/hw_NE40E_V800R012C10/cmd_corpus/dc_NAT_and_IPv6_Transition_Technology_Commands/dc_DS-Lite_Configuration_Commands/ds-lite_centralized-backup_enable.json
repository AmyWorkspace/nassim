    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn centralized DS-Lite providing backup for centralized DS-Lite, the master and backup DS-Lite devices are configured and both support centralized DS-Lite function. If a service board on the master DS-Lite device fails, the master DS-Lite device distributes traffic to the backup DS-Lite device for DS-Lite processing. After the service board on the master DS-Lite device recovers, user traffic switches back for DS-Lite switching.\nPrecautions\nThe ds-lite centralized-backup enable command takes effect only on the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
