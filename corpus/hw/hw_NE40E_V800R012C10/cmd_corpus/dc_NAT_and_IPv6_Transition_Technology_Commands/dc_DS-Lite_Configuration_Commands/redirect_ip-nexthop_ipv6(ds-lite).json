This command is used when the next-hop IP address of DS-Lite traffic is the same as that used\nin PBR re-direction.\nPrecautions\nAlthough both the inbound- and outbound-rated commands can be run simultaneously in a DS-Lite instance, network-to-user traffic's next-hop address can be set only to an IPv6 address, and user-to-network traffic's next-hop address can be set only to an IPv4 address. Only a single address can be set each of network-to-user and user-to-network traffic."
