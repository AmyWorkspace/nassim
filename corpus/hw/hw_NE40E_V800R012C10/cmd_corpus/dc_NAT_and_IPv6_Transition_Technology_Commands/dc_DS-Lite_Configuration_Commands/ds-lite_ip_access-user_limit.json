    "ExtraInfo": "The limit on the number of private network users sharing a public IP address is primarily used when no port range is specified. Without a port range specified, if a device creates a large number of DS-Lite sessions for each of private network users sharing a public IP address, user traffic may fail to be forwarded. The limit helps a device evenly map private IP addresses to public IP addresses, which prevent excess users from sharing the same IP address. When the ds-lite ip access-user limit, port range, and ds-lite port-limit commands are used, the smallest value takes effect."
