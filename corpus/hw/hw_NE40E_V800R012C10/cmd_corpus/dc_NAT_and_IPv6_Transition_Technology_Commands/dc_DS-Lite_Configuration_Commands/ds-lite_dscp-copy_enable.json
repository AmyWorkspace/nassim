    "ExtraInfo": "A carrier network differentiates users based on DSCP values carried in user packets and provides users with matching QoS services. In a DS-Lite scenario, user IPv4 packets reach a DS-Lite device along a DS-Lite tunnel at one hop, and the carrier IPv6 network cannot modify the DSCP values carried in these packets. To provide QoS services for users in the DS-Lite scenario, the carrier network must be enabled to copy the IPv6 DSCP value to the DSCP field in every IPv4 packet on the egress of a DS-Lite tunnel."
