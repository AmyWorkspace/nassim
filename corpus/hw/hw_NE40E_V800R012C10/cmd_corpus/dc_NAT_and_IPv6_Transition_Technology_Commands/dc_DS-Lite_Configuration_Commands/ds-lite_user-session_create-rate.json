If the rate at which packets are sent exceeds the configured rate, excess packets are discarded.\nPrerequisites\nA DS-Lite instance has been created, and the DS-Lite session number limit function has been enabled. By default, the limit function is enabled.\nPrecautions\nThe ds-lite user-session create-rate command takes effect only on VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
