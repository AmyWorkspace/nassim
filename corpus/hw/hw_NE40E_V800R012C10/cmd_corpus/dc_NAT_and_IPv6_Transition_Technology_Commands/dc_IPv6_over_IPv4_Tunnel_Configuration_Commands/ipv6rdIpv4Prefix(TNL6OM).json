    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure the IPv4 prefix length of a 6RD tunnel, run the ipv4-prefix length command. The length indicates the number of high-order bits to be deleted from the source tunnel address (an IPv4 address). The remaining bits of the IPv4 address and the 6RD prefix together form the 6RD delegated prefix.\nPrerequisites\nThe tunnel encapsulation mode has been set to 6RD using the tunnel-protocol ipv6-ipv4 6rd command.\nPrecautions\nA 6RD delegated prefix is composed of a 6RD prefix and part or all bits of the source tunnel (IPv4) address, with a length not exceeding 64 bits."
