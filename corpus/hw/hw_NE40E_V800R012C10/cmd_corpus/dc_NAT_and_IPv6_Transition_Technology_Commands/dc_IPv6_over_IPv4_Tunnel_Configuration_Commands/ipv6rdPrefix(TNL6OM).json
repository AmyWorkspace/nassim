    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA 6RD prefix is the IPv6 prefix assigned by a carrier for a 6RD address. The 6RD delegated prefix is calculated by combining the 6RD prefix and part or all bits of an IPv4 address. The 6RD delegated prefix is used to assign IPv6 address prefixes to devices or hosts in a 6RD domain.\nTo configure the 6RD prefix of a 6RD tunnel, run the ipv6-prefix command.\nPrerequisites\nThe tunnel encapsulation mode has been set to 6RD using the tunnel-protocol ipv6-ipv4 6rd command.\nPrecautions\nA 6RD delegated prefix is composed of a 6RD prefix and part or all bits of the source tunnel (IPv4) address, with a length not exceeding 64 bits."
