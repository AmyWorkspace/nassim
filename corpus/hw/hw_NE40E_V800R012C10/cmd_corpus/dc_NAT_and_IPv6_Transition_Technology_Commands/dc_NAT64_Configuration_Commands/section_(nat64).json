    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA NAT64 address pool is a collection of public IPv4 addresses. After receiving IPv6 packets sent by users, a NAT64 device translates private IPv4 addresses carried in the IPv4 packets to public IPv4 addresses and transmits the packets to a public network. The NAT64 address pool used in NAT64 is determined by a specific traffic policy.\nEither of the following modes can be used to configure a NAT64 address range:\nConfigure an address range by specifying a start address and an end address or by specifying a network range address with a mask using the nat64 address-group command in the NAT64 instance view.Run the section command in the NAT64 address pool view to configure a range in a public IP address pool.\n\nPrerequisites\nA NAT64 address pool has been configured."
