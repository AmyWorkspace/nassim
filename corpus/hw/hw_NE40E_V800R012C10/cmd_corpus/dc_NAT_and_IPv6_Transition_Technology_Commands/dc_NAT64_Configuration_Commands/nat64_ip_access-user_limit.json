    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command is mainly used in dynamic port allocation and per-port allocation scenarios where multiple private network users use the same public IP address for access.One public IP address can be shared by multiple private network users. If the available ports are insufficient for the number of private network users, the traffic of some private network users fails to be forwarded. The limit helps a device evenly map private IP addresses to public IP addresses, which prevent excess users from sharing the same IP address. To set the maximum number of private network users sharing the same public IP address, run the nat64 ip access-user limit command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E."
