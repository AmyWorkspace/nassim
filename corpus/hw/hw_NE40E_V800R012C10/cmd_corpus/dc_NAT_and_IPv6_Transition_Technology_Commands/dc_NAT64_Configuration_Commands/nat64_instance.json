    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA NAT64 instance is a platform for NAT64 attribute configuration. The NAT64 attributes that can be configured include a NAT64 address pool, NAT64 ALG, and a limit on the maximum number of NAT64 sessions. For user traffic assigned to a NAT64 instance, NAT64 operations are performed based on NAT64 attributes configured for the NAT64 instance.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the nat64 instance command is run and the specified NAT64 instance does not exist, an instance with the specified name is created and the NAT64 instance view is displayed. If the name exists, the view of the specified NAT64 instance is displayed.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display nat64 instance command to view the configuration of the NAT64 instance.\nPrecautions\nThe IDs of master and backup NAT64 instances must be the same in an inter-chassis backup scenario."
