    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the link MTU is small, NAT64 packet fragments may be generated. You can change the MTU value so that the packets for NAT64 are not fragmented, improving NAT64 translation efficiency.\nPrecautions\nIf the size of packets is greater than the configured MTU value, the packets are broken into a great number of fragments.If the MTU is set too large, packets may be transmitted at a low speed."
