    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo exclude a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses from a NAT64 address pool, each IP address sub-range in the original address range must be configured. To simplify the configuration, run the nat64 address-group exclude-ip-address command to implement the same function.\nPrerequisites\nA NAT64 instance has been created and assigned an IP address pool. The nat64 outbound command does not need to be run to configure an ACL rule for matching the NAT64 address pool.\nPrecautions\nThe nat64 address-group exclude-ip-address command only removes a public IP address or a public IP address range.A maximum of 10 IP address sub-ranges can be excluded from each IP address range. IP addresses in these sub-ranges cannot overlap.Before you disable a device from excluding a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses from a NAT64 address pool, ensure that exclude-ip-address configured in the undo nat64 address-group exclude-ip-address command is the same as that configured in the nat64 address-group exclude-ip-address command.If an address pool is configured by specifying mask, the device advertises specific UNRs instead of network segment UNRs after this command is run. If you run this command to exclude some public IP addresses, routes to the public IP addresses may fail to be advertised, and services may be interrupted."
