    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a NAT64 log host, run the nat64 log host command. After NAT64 translates a source private IP address to a source public IP address, the source that initiates a request to access a network cannot be located, which decreases network security. To improve network security, the flow log function can be configured. NAT64 logs record information about NAT64 flows so that administrators can obtain addresses used before NAT64 translation is performed to query and trace network activities and operations. This improves network availability and security.\nPrerequisites\nThe NAT64 log function has been enabled using the nat64 log enable command.\nPrecautions\nA log host is uniquely identified by its IP address, port number, and VPN instance name."
