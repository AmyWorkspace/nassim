    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a device to record PCP port reservation logs in a nat instance, run the nat log session port-reservation command. With this function enabled, if the port that the PCP client is to preempt is within the reserved port range, the device assigns the port and sends a flow log message. In the other situations, the device does not send such a log message. The CGN device then sends user log messages to implement the source tracing function.\nIf the reserved port range is configured and the PCP client uses a port within the allocatable port range of the PCP server, the PCP server does not send flow log messages.If the port used to send the common first packet, the device does not send flow log messages.If a flow table ages and a used port is within the reserved port range, the device does not send flow log messages.\n\nPrerequisites\nA flow log host has been configured and the flow log function has been enabled.\nThe port reservation function has been enabled."
