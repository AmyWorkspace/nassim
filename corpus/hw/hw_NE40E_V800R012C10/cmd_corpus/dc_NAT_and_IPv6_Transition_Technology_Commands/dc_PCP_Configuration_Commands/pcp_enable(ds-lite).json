    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Port Control Protocol (PCP) establishes PCP connections between customer premises equipment (CPE) and Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) devices to implement point-to-point (P2P) applications between terminal users accessing different CGN devices. PCP is used in Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) scenarios. In a PCP application, a CGN device functions as a PCP server, and a CPE functions as a PCP client. After the CPE sends user requests for public IP addresses and port numbers to the CGN device, the CGN device establishes P2P connections to the users attached to the CPE. The CGN device provides P2P services, such as teleconference, online games, and P2P transmission, for the users. PCP helps improve P2P traffic bandwidth and P2P user experience.\nPrerequisites\nThe PCP license has been activated using the active pcp vsuf command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAssign an IP address to the PCP server.\nPrecautions\nThe pcp enable command takes effect only on VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
