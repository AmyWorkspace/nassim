    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the MAP-E or MAP-T scenario, the device uses IA-PD to assign MAP prefixes to MAP users. After a MAP rule is bound to an IPv6 delegation prefix pool configured using the map-rule command, the device uses the configured MAP rule to assign MAP prefixes to MAP-E and MAP-T users.\nPrerequisites\nThe map-rule command has been run in the system view, and an IPv6 prefix and its length, an IPv4 prefix and its length, and an EA length have been specified for the MAP rule.\nPrecautions\nA MAP rule can only bound to the IPv6 delegation prefix pool.The prefix command cannot be run after a MAP rule is bound to an IPv6 delegation prefix pool.The map-rule command is mutually exclusive with the slaac-unshare-only, pd-unshare-only, dhcpv6-unshare-only, and vpn-instance commands."
