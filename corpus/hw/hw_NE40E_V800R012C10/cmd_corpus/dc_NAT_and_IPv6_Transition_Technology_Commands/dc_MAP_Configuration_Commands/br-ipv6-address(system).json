To configure a local IPv6 address, run the br-ipv6-address command.\nPrecautions\nA single local IPv6 address can be configured in each MAP-T or MAP-E instance. The local IPv6 address is mutually exclusive with an interface IP address, an address in a BRAS address pool, a NAT64 prefix address, DS-Lite local IPv6 address, and a PCPv6 server address."
