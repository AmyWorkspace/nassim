    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA device needs to deliver log server information based on the log server status. After heartbeat detection is enabled for log servers, to set the ICMP detection interval and the maximum number of allowed failed detection attempts, run the nat log host detect icmp command. If the maximum number of allowed failed detection attempts is reached, the device considers the log server unavailable.\nPrecautions\nThe nat log host detect icmp command takes effect on UDP log servers, not TCP log servers."
