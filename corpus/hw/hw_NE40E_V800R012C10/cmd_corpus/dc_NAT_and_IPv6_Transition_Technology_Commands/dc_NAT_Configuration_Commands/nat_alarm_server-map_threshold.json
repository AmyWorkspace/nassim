    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRun the display nat memory-usage servermap command to query the number of used server-map entries and the number of supported server-map entries. To monitor server-map entry usage, run the nat alarm server-map threshold command to set an alarm threshold for server-map entry usage.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf server-map entry usage reaches the specified alarm threshold, a service board sends an alarm to the NMS. If server-map entry usage exceeds the alarm threshold, the service board does not repeatedly send an alarm. After server-map entry usage falls to 87.5% of the threshold, the service board sends a clear alarm to the NMS.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
