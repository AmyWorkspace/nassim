    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo change the MSS value in TCP SYN packets after NAT processes the packets, run the nat tcp-mss command.\nThe MSS value defined in TCP specifies the length of a TCP packet. The MSS value is carried in the SYN packet and is negotiated when the TCP connection is being established.\nWhen the link MTU is small, NAT packet fragments may be generated. You can change the MSS value in TCP, so that the packets for NAT are not fragmented. This helps improve NAT efficiency.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the nat tcp-mss command is run in the system view, the NAT device changes the MSS value in all TCP packets for NAT. If the negotiated MSS value is greater than the MSS value configured using the  parameter, the negotiated MSS value is changed to the configured value. If the negotiated MSS value is smaller than the MSS value configured using the  parameter, the negotiated MSS value remains unchanged."
