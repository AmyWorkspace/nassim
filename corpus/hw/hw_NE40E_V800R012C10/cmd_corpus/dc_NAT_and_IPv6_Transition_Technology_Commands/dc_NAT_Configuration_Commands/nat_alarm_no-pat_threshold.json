    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the alarm threshold for No-PAT address pools, run the nat alarm No-pat address-group threshold command. The command helps monitor No-PAT address pool usage in each NAT instance. If No-PAT address pool usage reaches a specified threshold, an alarm is sent to the NMS. When the IP address usage falls below 87.5% of the preset threshold, the system generates a clear alarm.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the NAT address pool in non-easy IP mode."
