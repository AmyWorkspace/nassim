If only the primary VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S but not the secondary VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S is configured, this command is used only for service direction.\nPrecautions\nIn a DS-Lite dynamic load balancing scenario, CPUs mapped to service-location backup groups bound to instances cannot back up each other. In addition, these CPUs mapped to service-location backup groups must reside in different locations.\nIn a NAT dynamic load balancing scenario, CPUs mapped to service-location backup groups bound to instances cannot back up each other.
