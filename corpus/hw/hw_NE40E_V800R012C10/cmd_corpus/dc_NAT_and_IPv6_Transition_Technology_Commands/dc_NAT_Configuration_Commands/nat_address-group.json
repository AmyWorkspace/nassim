    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA NAT address pool is a collection of public IPv4 addresses. After receiving IPv4 packets sent by users, a NAT device translates private IPv4 addresses carried in the IPv4 packets to public IPv4 addresses and transmits the packets to a public network. The NAT address pool used in NAT is determined by a specific traffic policy.\nConfiguration Impact\nIP addresses in a NAT address pool cannot be assigned to interfaces."
