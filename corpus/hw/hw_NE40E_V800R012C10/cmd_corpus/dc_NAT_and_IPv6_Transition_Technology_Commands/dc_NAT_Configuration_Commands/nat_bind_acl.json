The command helps direct traffic to a service board for NAT processing.\nThe device processes traffic matching an ACL deny rule as follows:\nIf the mode deny-forward parameter is configured, traffic matching the ACL deny rule is transparently transmitted.If the mode deny-forward parameter is not configured, traffic matching the ACL deny rule is discarded.\n\nPrerequisites\nACL rules have been configured.\nPrecautions\nNAT traffic distribution on the public network outbound interface: This command is not supported by dot1q and QinQ VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces.\nIf ECMP with multiple equal-cost outbound interfaces specified is configured, traffic distribution configurations must be the same on these outbound interfaces.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
