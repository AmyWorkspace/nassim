    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe static source tracing algorithm parameters include the private network address pool, public network address pool, port range, and port size. A public network address pool can consist of multiple public network address segments. To create a public network address pool or enter the public network address pool view, run the global-pool command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nIn the public network address pool view for static source tracing algorithm, run the section command to add public network address segments to the public network address pool for the static source tracing algorithm.\nPrecautions\nIf static source tracing algorithm parameters have been configured, a bound public network address pool cannot be deleted, or no address segments can be added to the public network address pool view."
