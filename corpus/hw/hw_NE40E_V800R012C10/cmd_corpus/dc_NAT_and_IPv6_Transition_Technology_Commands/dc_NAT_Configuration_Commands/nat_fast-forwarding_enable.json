    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo reduce CPU load and improve service processing performance, the device can deliver NAT session entries from the multi-core CPU to the NP. The NP performs NAT forwarding on the traffic, implementing fast NAT service forwarding. You can enable or disable the fast forwarding function as required.\nPrecautions\nThe interval between enabling and disabling fast forwarding on the same service board must be longer than 60 seconds.\nOnly support VSUI-400/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S board.\nThe fast forwarding function is supported only in NAT444 scenarios.\nThe fast forwarding function takes effect only when the aging time of sessions is greater than 60s. This aging time can be configured using the nat session aging-time command.\nAfter the nat fast-forwarding enable command is run, the NAT session table is delivered from the multi-core CPU to the NP. When the display nat user-information vebose command is run to query user table traffic statistics, only data in the multi-core CPU user table is collected."
