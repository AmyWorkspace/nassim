    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a user session establishment rate, run the nat user-session create-rate extended-range command. If the rate of sending user session establishment packets exceeds the preset threshold, the excess packets are discarded.\nPrerequisites\nThe session rate limit function has been enabled in the associated NAT instance. By default, this function is enabled.\nPrecautions\nThe user session establishment rate configured using the nat user-session create-rate extended-range command is expressed in sessions per second and at a smaller precision, whereas the user session establishment rate configured using the nat user-session create-rate command is expressed in Kpps. If both of the two commands are run, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
