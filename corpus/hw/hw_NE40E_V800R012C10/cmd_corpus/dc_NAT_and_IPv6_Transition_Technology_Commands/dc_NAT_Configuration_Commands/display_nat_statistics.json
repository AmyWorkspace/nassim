The display nat statistics { discard | global } nat-instance command can be used in load balancing scenarios. Information about all load-balancing members in a NAT instance can be displayed.The display nat statistics received payload slot command displays only NAT statistics on the LPUF-51-E/LPUI-51-E/LPUI-51-S and VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E.Before using the payload parameter, you must run the nat statistics payload enable command in the NAT instance view.For VSUI-400 boards,transmit packet statistics are collected before route lookup.For VSUF-8-/VSUF-160/VSUI-160 boards,transmit packet statistics are collected after route lookup.\nFor NAT, DNS takes effect only on the LPUF-51-E/LPUI-51-E/LPUI-51-S. For NAT64, DNS takes effect only on the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S.Statistics about RTSP protocol packets on a service board can be used in NAT/DS-Lite.\n\nBefore using the payload parameter, you must run the nat statistics payload enable command in the NAT instance view.Statistics about RTSP protocol packets on a service board can be used in NAT."
