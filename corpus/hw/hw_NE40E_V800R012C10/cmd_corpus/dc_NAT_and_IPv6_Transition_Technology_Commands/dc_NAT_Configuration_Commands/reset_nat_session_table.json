    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo delete unnecessary NAT session entries, run the reset nat session table command. This allows new NAT session entries to be created for fault location and rectification.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the reset nat session table command is run, NAT session entries are deleted from the NAT session table based on the IP address, port number, or protocol types.\nPrecautions\nCheck whether you need to delete NAT session entry statistics before running the reset nat session table command. After the command is run, the deleted records cannot be restored. Therefore, exercise caution when using this command. The system does not display any message after NAT session entries are deleted.\nRun the display nat session table command to view NAT session entry information only after the NAT sessions entries have been deleted. The deletion process takes seconds or more than 1 minute, based on the number of NAT session entries.\nIf you repeatedly run the reset nat session table command and a previous command instance is in process, a device ignores the existing running command instance and displays a message.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\ncpe and prefix-length parameters can be configured only in NAT64."
