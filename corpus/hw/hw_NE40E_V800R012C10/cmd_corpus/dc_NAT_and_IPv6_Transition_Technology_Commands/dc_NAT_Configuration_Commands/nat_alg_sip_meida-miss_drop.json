    "ExtraInfo": "When NAT ALG for SIP is configured and SIP terminals on the private and public networks establish a connection, a private network user sends a SIP ACK packet to notify the CGN ALG of successful negotiation. Upon receipt of the packet, the CGN ALG generates a server-map table and uses it to create a correct flow table to guide media flow forwarding. If the CGN ALG receives media flows sent by the private network before creating a server-map, the CGN ALG creates a common flow table, which adversely affects media flow communication. To address this problem, run the nat alg sip media-miss drop command to enable the CGN ALG to discard NAT ALG SIP media streams before creating a server-map table. After the ALG server-map table is created, flow tables can be correctly created to ensure proper media stream communication."
