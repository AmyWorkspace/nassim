Session entries can be backed up only if the active time of session traffic is longer than the configured delay time of service-location backup.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display service-ha global-information delay-time command to view the configured delay time of service-location backup.\nPrecautions\nIf the configured backup delay is less than 3/16 of the aging time of the sessions, the fast forwarding sessions can be backed up only after 3/16 of the aging time is reached. Non-fast forwarding sessions are not affected."
