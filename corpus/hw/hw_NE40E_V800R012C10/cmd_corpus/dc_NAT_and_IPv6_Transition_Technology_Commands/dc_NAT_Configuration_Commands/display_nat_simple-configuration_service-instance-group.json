Then the location slot command is run in the NAT instance so that the device automatically generates a service-location backup group and binds it to the instance group named _default_.\nTo view information about a service-instance-group service instance group and a service-location backup group that are generated by default in a simplified NAT instance, run the display nat simple-configuration service-instance-group.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
