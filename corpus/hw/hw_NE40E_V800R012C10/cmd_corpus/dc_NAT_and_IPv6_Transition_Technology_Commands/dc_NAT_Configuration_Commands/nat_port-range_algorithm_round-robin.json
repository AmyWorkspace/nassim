    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure the round-robin algorithm used by a device to allocate port ranges, run the nat port-range algorithm round-robin command. This algorithm enables a device to query port ranges starting at a cursor index and finds and assigns an idle port range. If no idle port range is available, the device queries port ranges based on the start index. After the device assigns a port range, the device moves the cursor index to the port range next to the assigned one, finds an idle port range, and moves the cursor index to the idle one if there is.\nConfiguration Impact\nA port range specified in the port-range command that is assigned in cursor-based port allocation mode will not be used immediately after being released. In some special scenarios, such a port range may be used immediately after being released.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
