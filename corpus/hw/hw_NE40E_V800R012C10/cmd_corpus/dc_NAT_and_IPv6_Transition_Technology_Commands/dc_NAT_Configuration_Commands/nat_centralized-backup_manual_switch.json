    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo ensure service continuity in case of a network or hardware upgrade on the BRAS, run the nat centralized-backup manual switch command to configure the manual switching function for centralized backup of distributed CGN.\nPrerequisites\nThe automatic switching and switchback function for centralized backup of distributed CGN has been enabled using the nat centralized-backup enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter user traffic is manually switched to centralized CGN devices for NAT implementation in centralized backup of distributed CGN, the public network resources on the BRAS will be reclaimed, causing fast aging of NAT session table entries.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
