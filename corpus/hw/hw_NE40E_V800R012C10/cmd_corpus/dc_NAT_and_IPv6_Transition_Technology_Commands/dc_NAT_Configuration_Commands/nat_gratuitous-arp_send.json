    "ExtraInfo": "If a CGN device is changed and has its CGN public IP address and the IP address of an interface on the public network side on the same network segment, to speed up ARP entry updates, run the nat gratuitous-arp send command on the public network side interface to send gratuitous ARP packets. Each board on a device sends a gratuitous ARP packet every 30s."
