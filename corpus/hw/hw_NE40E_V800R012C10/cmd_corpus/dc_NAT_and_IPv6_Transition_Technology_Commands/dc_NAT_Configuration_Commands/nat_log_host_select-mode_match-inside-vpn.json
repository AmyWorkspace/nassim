    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, each time a log is generated in a NAT instance, a device sends it to a log server that is randomly selected from a log server group. To send logs to a log server based on the user private-network VPN instance, run the nat log host select-mode match-inside-vpn command.\nPrecautions\nNote the following issues:\nIf the inside-vpn configured for a log server is the same as the user VPN instance, a device sends logs to the log server.If the inside-vpn parameter is not configured for a log server, logs only of public network users can be sent to the log server.If the user VPN instance differs from the inside-vpn configured for a log server, logs of this user are not sent.Before you delete the mode of selecting a log server based on user private-network VPN instances, delete the log server with the inside-vpn parameter configured from the NAT instance.\n\nThe nat log host select-mode match-inside-vpn command takes effect only on the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
