    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA dynamic address pool accepts address segment applications and releases addresses based on address pool usage:\nIf address usage of an address pool reaches an upper limit, a request is sent to an address server to apply for addresses.If address usage of an address pool reaches a lower limit, a request is sent to an address server to release addresses.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the ip used-threshold command is configured multiple times, only the latest configuration takes effect."
