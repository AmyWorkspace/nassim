    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nLoad balancing routes calculated using a hash algorithm may vary according to network traffic models. If a hash algorithm does not meet your expectation, run the nat load-balance hash-arithmetic command to configure a hash algorithm. This command applies to ECMP and trunk load balancing on a CGN network.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E."
