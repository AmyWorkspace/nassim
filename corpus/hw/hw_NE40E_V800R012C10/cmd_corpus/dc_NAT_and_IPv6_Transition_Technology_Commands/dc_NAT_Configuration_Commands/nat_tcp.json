    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe MSS value defined in TCP specifies the length of a TCP packet. The MSS value is carried in the SYN packet and is negotiated when the TCP connection is being established.\nConfiguration Impact\nIn the NAT instance view, the CGN device changes the MSS value for all the TCP packets that belong to NAT services. If the negotiated MSS value is greater than the MSS value configured by using the mss-value command, the negotiated MSS value is changed to the configured value; if the negotiated MSS value is smaller than the MSS value configured by using the mss-value command, the negotiated MSS value remains unchanged.\nPrecautions\nThe nat tcp adjust-mss command configured in the NAT instance view takes preference over the nat tcp adjust-mss command configured in the system view. This command is applicable only to the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
