    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a CGN service board fails, CGN users cannot access the device using a private IP address. In this situation, you can configure public IP address-based access for them to ensure that they can get online. After the CGN service board recovers, public IP address-based access can be switched back to private IP address-based access.\nDuring the switching, CGN users using public IP addresses need to go offline and obtain private IP addresses to go online.\nTo enable automatic switchback, run the cgn-pub-user auto-cut enable command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
