    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run the cut access-user cgn-pub-user command to log out CGN public network users and switch public IP address-based access back to private IP address-based access after a faulty service board recovers.\nPrecautions\nA CGN device undergoes the internal logout process for CGN users cutback, which cannot trigger logout for DHCP CGN public network users. Therefore, the CGN device differentiates the DHCP CGN public network users and the other users.\nThis command only takes effect on VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
