When the primary VSUF restores, the switchback function for inter-board backup is enabled, and the switchback timer is started. Switchback is performed once the switchback period starts.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display service-ha global-information preempt-time command to view the switchback period.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S and LPUF-51-E/LPUI-51-E/LPUI-51-S."
