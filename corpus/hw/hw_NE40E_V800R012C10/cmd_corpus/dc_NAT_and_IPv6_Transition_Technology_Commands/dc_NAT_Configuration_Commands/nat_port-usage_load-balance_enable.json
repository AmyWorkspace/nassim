    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a user attempts to get online, the user selects a public address pool mapped to private network information based on a NAT translation policy. A public IP address is randomly selected from the public address pool. This process ensures that public IP addresses are evenly assigned to users.\nIn dynamic port allocation scenarios, if a user dynamically applies for a great number of public ports, high usage of the ports mapped to a public IP address results in the insufficient number of ports assigned to other users within the same public network, which compromises services of the other users.\nTo address this problem, run the nat port-usage load-balance enable command to enable port load balancing for public NAT address pools. With this function enabled, new online users preferentially select public IP addresses with lower port usage, which leads to evenly use of ports within a public address pool.\nPrecautions\nThe nat port-usage load-balance enable command takes effect only on the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
