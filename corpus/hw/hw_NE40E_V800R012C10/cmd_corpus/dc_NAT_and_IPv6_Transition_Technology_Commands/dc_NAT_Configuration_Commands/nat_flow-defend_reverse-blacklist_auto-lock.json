    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a NAT blacklist is configured and its automatic lock function is enabled, once a device detects traffic matching entries in the blacklist, the device locks the IP address listed in the blacklist. As a result, users assigned the locked IP address cannot get online, and new users are not assigned this IP address.\nPrerequisites\nThe reverse first-packet blacklist function has been enabled using the undo nat flow-defend reverse-blacklist disable command.\nPrecautions\nThe automatically locked IP address must be the one contained in the blacklist. When the IP address is being locked, the device does not advertise a blackhole route destined for the IP address.\nThis command is mutually exclusive with the nat flow-defend reverse-blacklist lock-ip-address manual-unlock command.\nThe nat flow-defend reverse-blacklist auto-lock enable command takes effect only on the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S.\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
