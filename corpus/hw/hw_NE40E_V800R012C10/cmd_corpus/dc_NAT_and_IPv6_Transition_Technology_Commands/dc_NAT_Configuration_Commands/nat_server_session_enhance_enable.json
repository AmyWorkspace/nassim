    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a device to create a flow table after the device receives the first packet that is not a TCP SYN packet and the packet matches the address of an address-level internal server, run the nat server session enhance enable command. This command is used when an internal server receives and sends TCP packets over inconsistent paths.\nPrecautions\nThe nat server session enhance enable command is mutually exclusive with the nat alg command.\nRunning the nat server session enhance enable command or its undo form triggers the reestablishment of the flow tables that are created after packets match the address-level internal server.\nThe flow table aging time is equal to the aging time of TCP packets, regardless of TCP packet types."
