If the rate at which packets are sent exceeds the configured rate, excess packets are discarded.\nPrerequisites\nThe limitation on the rate at which packets are sent to create a flow on a NAT device has been enabled using the nat user-session create-rate limit enable command. This function is enabled on a device by default."
