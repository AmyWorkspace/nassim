    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen IPv4 packets are distributed to the service board based on an ACL policy, some IPv4 packets that match the NAT traffic policy fail to be NATed and are by default transparently transmitted over the public network. Such IPv4 packets may affect normal traffic forwarding on the public network. To address this problem, run the nat pure-ip-packet drop command to enable the system to discard the IP packets that are not NATed after being distributed to the service board.\nPrecautions\nAfter the nat pure-ip-packet drop command is run, all the user packets, except TCP, UDP, ICMP, and GRE packets, are discarded after being distributed to the service board."
