    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA service board by default transparently transmits TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets that do not match a NAT policy. To improve network security, disable a device from transparently transmitting non-NAT packets. To meet this requirement, run the nat session-miss mode drop command to enable a device to discard TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets that do not match a NAT policy.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S."
