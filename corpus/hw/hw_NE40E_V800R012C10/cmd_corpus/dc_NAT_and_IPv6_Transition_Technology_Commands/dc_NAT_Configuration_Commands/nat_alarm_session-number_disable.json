    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo disable the trap or log function for the number of NAT sessions, run the nat alarm session-number disable command. If the number of NAT sessions on a specific service board reaches the alarm threshold, the service board can record a log and send a trap to the NMS. After the number of NAT sessions falls to 87.5% of the upper limit, the service can also record a log and send a clear trap to the NMS.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
