    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf no internal server is configured or if no session table entries can be found on the NAT device for public network traffic, the NAT device considers public network-to-private network traffic reaching a specified rate threshold as attack traffic. This function prevents attacks initiated using network first packets on a specified public IP address, public port number, or protocol. The attacks cause high CPU usage, which adversely affects normal traffic. If continuous public attack traffic is transmitted, enable the NAT blacklist function.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
