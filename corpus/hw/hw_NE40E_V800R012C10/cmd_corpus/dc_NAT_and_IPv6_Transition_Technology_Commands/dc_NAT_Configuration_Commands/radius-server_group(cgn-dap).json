    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the address usage of a dynamic address pool reaches the threshold, the CGN device requests a new address segment from the RADIUS server. When the address usage of a dynamic address pool falls below the threshold, the CGN device proactively releases idle address segments to the RADIUS server.\nPrerequisites\nThe dynamic address pool has been configured.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the configuration, the CGN dynamically requests address segments from the specified RADIUS server group and releases address segments to the RADIUS server group.\nPrecautions\nThe authentication username and password cannot be deleted if a dynamic address segment exists locally or if a device is applying for an address segment."
