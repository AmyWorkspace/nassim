    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe NAT log host is configured using the nat log host command supports logs in UDP mode. To reliably transmit user logs without loss, configure a NAT device to send users logs in TCP format to a NAT log host.\nTo establish a TCP connection between a NAT device and a log host, run the nat log tcp start-port command to set the start port number used in the TCP connection.\nFollow-up Procedure\nThe nat log tcp host command configures a NAT log host to receive user syslogs in TCP format. With this command run, a NAT device sends user syslog logs in TCP format to the log host.\nPrecautions\nYou must plan the start port number and check whether the start port number to be specified is used. The start port number must be not in use.\nThe nat log tcp start-port command takes effect only on the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E."
