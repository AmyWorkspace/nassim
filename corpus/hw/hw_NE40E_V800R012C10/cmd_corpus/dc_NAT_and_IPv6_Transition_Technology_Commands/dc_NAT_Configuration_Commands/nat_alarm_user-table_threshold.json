    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the alarm threshold of the total number of user tables, run the nat alarm user-table threshold command. If user table usage reaches the alarm threshold, a service board sends an alarm to the NMS.\nPrerequisites\nThe trap or log function has been enabled for user tables using the nat alarm user-table command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf user table usage reaches the specified alarm threshold, the service board sends an alarm to the NMS. If user table usage exceeds the alarm threshold, the service board does not repeatedly send an alarm. After user table usage falls to 87.5%, the service board sends a clear alarm to the NMS.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
