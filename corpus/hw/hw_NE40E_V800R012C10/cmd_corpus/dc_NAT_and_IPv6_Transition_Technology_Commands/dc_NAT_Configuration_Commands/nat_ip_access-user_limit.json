    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe nat ip access-user limit command is mainly used in dynamic port allocation, semi-dynamic port allocation, and per-port allocation scenarios. In these scenarios, multiple private network users share a public IP address for access. If the number of access users of a private network is too large, the new users cannot access the port. As a result, the traffic of some private network users cannot be forwarded. By limiting the number of online users on a single public IP address, users are allocated to each public IP address to prevent multiple users from accessing the same public IP address.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the VSUF-80/VSUF-160/VSUI-160-E/VSUI-400/VSUI-400-E/VSUI-400A/VSUI-400A-E/VSUI-400-S/VSUI-400A-S.\nThe nat ip access-user limit and nat bind static-mapping commands are mutually exclusive."
