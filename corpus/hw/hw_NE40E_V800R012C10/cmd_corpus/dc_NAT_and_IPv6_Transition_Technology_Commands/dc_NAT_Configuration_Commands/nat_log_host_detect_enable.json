    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a CGN device is to detect the log server status, run the nat log host detect enable command.\nPrecautions\nWhen heartbeat detection is disabled for the log server, the log server status is available by default. When a new log server is specified and heartbeat detection is disabled for it, the log server is available.\nAfter heartbeat detection is enabled for the log server, note the following issues:\nIf a log server is configured, it remains available and is set to unavailable only after the heartbeat detection function is enabled and detects the unavailable status of the log server.The default status of a newly configured log server is set to unavailable. After the device receives a ping reply packet, the device sets the log server to available.\nHeartbeat detection takes effect only on the UDP log server, not on the TCP log server."
