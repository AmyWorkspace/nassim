    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a NAT log host, run the nat log host command. After NAT translates a source private IP address to a source public IP address, the source that initiates a request to access a network cannot be located, which decreases network security. To improve network security, the flow log function can be configured. NAT logs record information about NAT flows so that administrators can obtain addresses before NAT translation is performed to query network activities and operations. This improves network availability and security.\nPrecautions\nThe secondary parameter in the NAT instance can divide log hosts to two log host groups. Each host group accommodates a maximum of 16 log hosts.\nA log host is uniquely identified by its IP address, port number, and VPN instance name.Flow logs cannot be sent by a management interface.After a log host is configured, you must enable the user-level log or flow log function so that the device sends NAT logs to the host."
