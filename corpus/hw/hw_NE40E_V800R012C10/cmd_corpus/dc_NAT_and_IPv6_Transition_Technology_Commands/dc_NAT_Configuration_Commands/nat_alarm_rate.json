    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the maximum number of alarm packets that a service board can send every second, run the nat alarm rate command. Frequently sending alarm packets to the NMS deteriorates NMS performance. To address this problem, set the rate at which alarm packets are sent. If the number of trap or log packets to be sent exceeds the specified upper limit, subsequent packets are dropped.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
