    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo monitor user-based port usage on a NAT device, run the nat alarm user port-number threshold command to set an alarm threshold for user-based port usage to enable the NAT device to generate an alarm if the threshold is reached.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you run the nat alarm address-group port-number threshold command to configure an alarm threshold, an alarm is reported when the port usage of a NAT address pool reaches the threshold. This alarm is cleared when the port usage of the NAT address pool falls below 7/8 of the threshold.\nPrecautions\nThe command nat alarm port-number user enable needs to be configured first.\nThis command cannot be run after the vsm on-board-mode enable command is run."
