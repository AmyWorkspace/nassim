The device load-balances traffic based on the number of users bound to the NAT instance by default.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the load-balance user-group refer-service-location command is run on a device, the device is enabled to check the active/standby status of service-locations when performing the load balancing function in the scenario where multiple user groups are configured in the AAA domain and bound to a NAT instance.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe load balancing algorithm is affected when multiple user groups are configured in the AAA domain and bound to a NAT instance."
