    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo change the IP address of a next hop to which packets are redirected, run the redirect ip-nexthop command. This command is used when the next-hop IP address NAT traffic is the same as that used in PBR redirection.\nPrecautions\nTo redirect all user traffic, run the redirect ip-nexthop command to specify a next-hop IP address to which user traffic is redirected.\nA singe redirect ip-nexthop command instance can be run for either network-to-user inbound or user-to-network outbound packets in each NAT instance."
