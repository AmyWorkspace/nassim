    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe static source tracing algorithm parameters include the private network address pool, public network address pool, port range, and port size. A private network address pool can consist of multiple private network address segments. To create a private network address pool or enter the private network address pool view, run the inside-pool command. To configure a private network address segment, run the section command.\nPrecautions\nIf static source tracing algorithm parameters have been configured in the static source tracing algorithm view, a bound private network address pool cannot be deleted, or no address segments can be added to the private network address pool view."
