    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA NAT-enabled device is deployed on the egress of an enterprise network, whereas NAT does not need to be performed for a great amount of traffic transmitted within the enterprise network. To prevent an inbound interface from enforcing a NAT traffic policy to direct intra-enterprise network traffic to a NAT board for NAT processing, a NAT traffic policy can be configured on an outbound interface connected to a public network. Therefore, the device matches traffic only destined for a public network against the NAT traffic policy.\nThe device processes traffic matching an ACL deny rule as follows:\nIf the mode deny-forward parameter is configured, traffic matching the ACL deny rule is transparently transmitted.If the mode deny-forward parameter is not configured, traffic matching the ACL deny rule is discarded.\n\nPrerequisites\nEnsure that the following operations have been performed:\nAn ACL rule has been defined.The address pool of a simplified NAT instance has been configured using the nat address-group or nat address-group unnumbered interface command.\n\nPrecautions\nThe nat bind acl address-group command is mutually exclusive with the nat bind acl instance command.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe nat bind acl address-group command is mutually exclusive with the nat bind acl instance command."
