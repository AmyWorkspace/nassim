    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a global static address pool is used by a NAT or DS-Lite instance enabled with load balancing, address resources in the global static address pool are shared among all CPUs in the instance and allocated on demand. By enabling load balancing among all static address pools in a static address pool, you can ensure that each CPU in the instance has an equal number of address resources, preventing service loss caused by uneven allocation.\nPrecautions\nIn CU separation mode, when distributed NAT users are online in a NAT instance, the load balancing function for address assignment in a global static address pool does not take effect."
