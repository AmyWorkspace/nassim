    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter an IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel interface is created, you need to run the source command in the interface view to configure a source interface or a source IPv6 address for the tunnel interface. Then, run the binding tunnel ipv4-ipv6 command to enable IPv4 over IPv6 on the source interface or the interface to which the source IPv6 address belongs, so that packets can be transmitted from the source tunnel interface to the corresponding tunnel service boards for processing.\nPrecautions\nAfter IPv4 over IPv6 is enabled on an interface, the interface cannot be used for other services.IPv4 over IPv6 and GRE are mutually exclusive.IPv4 over IPv6 can only be enabled on one-dimensional tunnel interfaces. If a Layer 3 interface is specified as the source interface for a one-dimensional tunnel interface using the source command, you must enable IPv4 over IPv6 on the Layer 3 interface using the binding tunnel ipv4-ipv6 command. Otherwise, packets cannot be sent or received on the one-dimensional tunnel interface."
