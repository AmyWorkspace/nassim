    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn distributed GRE mode, GRE packets are encapsulated and decapsulated on their own ingress interface boards. Tunnel interfaces are numbered in the format of an integer.\nIn distributed GRE mode, if GRE packets are load-balanced among multiple links, there is a possibility that fragments of a packet are transmitted along multiple links. On the tunnel egress, when fragments are received through multiple interface boards, reassembling on each interface board may fail due to timeout.\nTo resolve this problem, run the target reassemble board command to configure the mapping from a tunnel interface to a GRE reassembly board so that fragments are sent to the reassembly board for reassembling. After that, packets can be forwarded properly."
