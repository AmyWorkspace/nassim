    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo query binding information about GRE service or reassembly boards, run the display tunnel gre command. Binding information includes the number of interfaces bound to the board, slot IDs of the master and slave boards, and slot ID of the GRE service or reassembly board that is processing GRE services.\nPrecautions\nWhen you configure a GRE tunnel, specific binding information about master and slave GRE service or reassembly boards can be displayed only after slot IDs are configured for both the master and slave GRE service or reassembly boards."
