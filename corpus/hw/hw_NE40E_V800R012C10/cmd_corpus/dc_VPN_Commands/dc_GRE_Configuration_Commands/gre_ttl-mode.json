    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a mode for processing TTLs carried in packets transmitted over a GRE tunnel, run the gre ttl-mode command.\nPrerequisites\nThe TTL processing mode configured using the gre ttl-mode command takes effect only after a GRE tunnel is bound to a loopback interface using the binding tunnel gre command. The two commands can be run in any sequence.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the gre ttl-mode pipe command is configured, the TTL placed in the encapsulating IP header of a GRE packet is 255; when the gre ttl-mode uniform command is configured, the TTL placed in the encapsulating IP header of a GRE packet is the same as the TTL placed in the inner IP header of the packet.\nIf the gre ttl-mode command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThis command applies only to the Admin-VS."
