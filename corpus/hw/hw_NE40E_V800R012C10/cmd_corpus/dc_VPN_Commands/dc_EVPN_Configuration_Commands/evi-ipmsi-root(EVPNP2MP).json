    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a multicast EVPN, the root node is the ingress of an mLDP P2MP tunnel. An mLDP P2MP tunnel has multiple leaf nodes, but only one root node. To specify the current device as the root node for the multicast EVPN and enter the EVI I-PMSI root view for root node configuration, run the root command.\nPrecautions\nIn a dual-homing scenario, if the dual-homing PEs are configured as root nodes using the root command, the two PEs can no longer be configured as leaf nodes using the leaf command."
