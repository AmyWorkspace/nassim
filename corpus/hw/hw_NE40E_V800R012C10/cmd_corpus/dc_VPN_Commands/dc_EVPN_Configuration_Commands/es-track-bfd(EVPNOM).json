    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a scenario where a CE is dual-homed to PEs, a BFD session is set up between the PEs. To enable BFD to track the dual-homing interfaces on the CE, run the es track bfd command. If one of the interfaces goes Down, the corresponding PE detects the fault using BFD, which triggers a rapid primary/backup DF switchover. This configuration allows DF switching to be associated with BFD, therefore facilitating a rapid switchover in case of a link failure."
