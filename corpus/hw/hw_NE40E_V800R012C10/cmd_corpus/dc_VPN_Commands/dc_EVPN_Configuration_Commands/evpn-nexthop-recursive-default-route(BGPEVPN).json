    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN over SRv6 scenario, a PE may fail to recurse routes over an SRv6 path due to a configuration error or network fault. To address the problem, run the nexthop recursive-lookup default-route command on the PE to allow the remote PE to send a default route to the local PE. In this manner, if the next-hop IP address of specific routes on the local PE is unreachable, packets can be routed over a default route through an SRv6 path to ensure service continuity."
