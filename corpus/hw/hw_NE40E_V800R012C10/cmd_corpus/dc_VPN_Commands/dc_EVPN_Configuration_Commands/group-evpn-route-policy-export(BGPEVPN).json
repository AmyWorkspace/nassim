    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a route-policy is created, the peer route-policy export command is used to apply a Route-Policy to a peer group so that the routes advertised to peer group can be controlled. To be specific, only the necessary routes are advertised to the peer group. In this manner, route management is implemented, the scale of the routing table is reduced, and fewer network resources are consumed.\nPrerequisites\nIf the command specifies a route-policy, use the route-policy command to create the specified route-policy first.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer route-policy command is run for a peer group, all the members of the peer group inherit the configuration.\nBinding a route-policy after a BGP peer relationship is established may cause peer flapping."
