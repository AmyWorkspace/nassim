    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen packets enter a public network from an EVPN or BD EVPN for BUM forwarding, board selection for internal loopback is performed based on a main control board, run the evpn reserve-interface enhancement command, this configuration allows primary and backup leaf nodes to be delivered to different boards for protection, after a board is removed, the PST down event on the reserved interface triggers a primary/backup leaf node switchover, improving the link switching performance."
