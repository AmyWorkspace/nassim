    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the data center interconnect (DCI) solution, DCI-PE adds the regeneration flag to the received EVPN routes before sending the routes to the peer. By default, the function to add the regeneration flag to the routes received from the peer is disabled. Specifically, DCI-PE does not re-encapsulate the routes received from the peer. Therefore, to allow DCI-PE to re-encapsulate the EVPN routes, run the peer import reoriginate command to enable the function to add the regeneration flag to the routes received from the peer.\nPrerequisites\nRoute exchange with a specified peer group has been enabled using the peer enable command."
