    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN VPWS scenario where a CE is multi-homed to PEs in single-active mode and no E-Trunk is configured, a CE at the near end is multi-homed to PEs, and traffic from the remote end are sent to the PEs. To prevent the CE from receiving multiple copies of traffic from the PEs, one of the PEs must be elected to forward traffic to the CE.\nTo meet this requirement, run the vpws-df-election type service-id command to enable service ID-based DF election. This configuration allows PE->CE traffic to be balanced along the multi-homed links based on service IDs.\nPrecautions\nConfigure the same DF election mode on all the multi-homed PEs.By default, physical interface-based designated forwarder (DF) election for an EVPN VPWS without this command configuration."
