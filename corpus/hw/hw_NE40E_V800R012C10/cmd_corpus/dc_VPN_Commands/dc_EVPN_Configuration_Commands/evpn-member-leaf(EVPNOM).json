    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIn an EVPN E-Tree scenario, if a basic EVPN instance is configured, the EVPN instance is bound to an AC interface. If a BD-EVPN instance is configured, the BD-EVPN instance is bound to a BD, and then the BD is associated with a Layer 2 sub-interface. By default, the AC interface and Layer 2 sub-interface have the root attribute. To set the leaf attribute for the AC interface or Layer 2 sub-interface, run the etree enable and evpn e-tree-leaf commands. This configuration disables leaf AC interfaces from sending traffic to each other. Only a leaf AC interface and a root AC interface can send traffic to each other.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nEVPN E-Tree has been enabled in a BD-EVPN instance or a basic EVPN instance using the etree enable command.\nFor the basic EVPN instance, the instance has been bound to the target AC interface using the evpn binding vpn-instance command. For the BD-EVPN instance, the target Layer 2 sub-interface has been added to a BD using the bridge-domain command."
