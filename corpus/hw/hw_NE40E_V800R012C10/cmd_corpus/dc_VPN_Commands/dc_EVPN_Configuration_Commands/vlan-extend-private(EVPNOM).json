    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRun the vlan-extend private enable command to enable the device to generate local MAC routes with the VLAN private extended community attribute.\nIn a CE multi-homing scenario, MAC route redirection allows PEs connected to the same CE to redirect the outbound interfaces of MAC routes destined for the CE to the local AC interface, shortening the forwarding path and improving forwarding efficiency. In addition, when an AC interface on one PE fails, MAC routes can be quickly redirected to the outbound interface and traffic is forwarded by the other all-active PE, improving reliability. To implement MAC route redirection, run the vlan-extend private enable command on the PE to enable MAC routes to carry the VLAN private extended community attribute, and then run the vlan-extend redirect enable command to enable MAC route redirection."
