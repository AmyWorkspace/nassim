    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allow two devices between which a BGP-EVPN peer relationship is established to exchange ORF routes carrying the import VPN target (IRT) of each other's EVPN instance, run the vpn-orf enable command to enable EVPN ORF. Upon receipt of ORF routes, a device uses the export VPN target (ERT) carried in the EVPN routes to be advertised to match the IRT in the received ORF routes so that the peer can receive only the expected routes. This relieves the pressure on the peer and reduces network load.\nPrecautions\nThis command must be used together with the ipv4-family vpn-target and peer enable (BGP-EVPN address family view) commands. If only the vpn-orf enable command is run, the BGP speaker in the BGP-EVPN address family view does not advertise ORF routes to its peers."
