    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nData Center Interconnection (DCI) provides solutions used to interconnect data centers. In DCI solutions, each DCI-PE re-encapsulates received EVPN or VPNv4/v6 routes before sending them to its peers.\nAfter the EVPN routes that are received from the DC side and carry the VXLAN encapsulation attribute are regenerated on the DCI-PE, the DCI-PE advertises EVPN routes that carry the MPLS encapsulation attribute to the BGP EVPN peer on the DCI backbone network.After the EVPN/VPNv4/VPNv6 routes that are received from the BGP EVPN/VPNv4/VPNv6 peer on the DCI backbone network and carry the MPLS encapsulation attribute are regenerated on the local DCI-PE, the local DCI-PE advertises EVPN routes that carry the VXLAN encapsulation attribute to the DC side.\nn a scenario where an EVPN L3VPN over SRv6 is spliced with a common L3VPN over MPLS, border leaves must be configured with the function to re-originate SRv6-encapsulated EVPN routes and advertise these EVPN routes to a BGP EVPN IPv6 peer upon receipt of VPNv4/VPNv6 routes carrying the MPLS encapsulation attribute.\n\nPrerequisites\nRoute information exchange has been enabled between the local device and a specified peer using the peer enable command."
