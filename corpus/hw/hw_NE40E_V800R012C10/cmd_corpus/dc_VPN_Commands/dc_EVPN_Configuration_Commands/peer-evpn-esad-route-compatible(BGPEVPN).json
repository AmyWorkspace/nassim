    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an earlier software version, the ESI label of an ES AD route is placed in the MPLS Label field of EVPN NLRI instead of being in the ESI Label extended community attribute according to relevant standards. Therefore, to ensure that the devices running earlier and later software versions can communicate with each other, configure the format in which ES AD routes are to be sent. To send ES AD routes in a standard format, run the peer esad-route-compatible enable command. To send ES AD routes in a non-standard format, run the peer esad-route-compatible disable command.\nPrecautions\nIf the peer group and the specified peer are configured to send ES AD routes in different formats, the specified peer sends ES AD routes in its own configured format."
