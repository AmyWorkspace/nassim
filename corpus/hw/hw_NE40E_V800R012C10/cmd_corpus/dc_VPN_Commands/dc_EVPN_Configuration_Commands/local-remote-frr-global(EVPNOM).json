    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the EVPN VPLS dual-homing single-active or dual-homing active-active scenario, a CE is dual-homed to PE1 and PE2. If the link between the CE and PE1 fails, to prevent downstream unicast traffic from being lost after reaching PE1, run the local-remote frr enable command. This configuration allows PE1 to forward traffic to PE2 so that traffic is sent to the CE through the link between PE2 and the CE.\nPrecautions\nBy default, an EVPN instance complies with the global configuration of FRR for MAC routes between the local and remote ends. if FRR for MAC routes between the local and remote ends in an EVPN instance is not configured in an EVPN instance, the global configuration of FRR for MAC routes between the local and remote ends takes effect; if FRR for MAC routes between the local and remote ends is configured in an EVPN instance, the configuration in the EVPN instance takes precedence of the global configuration.\nThe local-remote frr enable command must be used together with the vlan-extend private enable and vlan-extend redirect enable commands to implement FRR for local and remote MAC routes."
