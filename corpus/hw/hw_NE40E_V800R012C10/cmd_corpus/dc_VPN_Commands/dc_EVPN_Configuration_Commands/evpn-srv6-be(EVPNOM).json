    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN VPWS or EVPN VPLS scenario, if service traffic needs to be carried over an SRv6 tunnel, the segment-routing ipv6 locator command can be run to add the SID attribute to the EVPN routes to be sent. In this case, devices also receive the EVPN routes carrying the SID attribute. To allow route recursion over a tunnel based on the SID attribute carried in routes, run the segment-routing ipv6 best-effort command.\nPrerequisites\nAn RD has been configured for an EVPN instance."
