    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn ESI all-active scenarios, a CE at the near end is multi-homed to PEs, and broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast (BUM) packets from the remote end are sent to the PEs. To prevent the CE from receiving multiple copies of BUM traffic from the PEs, elect one of the PEs as a DF to forward the BUM traffic to the CE.\nBy default, interface-based DF election is enabled, which may cause traffic unbalance among multi-homing links. In this case, run the df-election type vlan command to enable VLAN-based DF election. This configuration allows PE-CE BUM traffic to be balanced among the multi-homing links based on VLANs.\nPrecautions\nConfigure the same DF election mode on all the multi-homed PEs on a VLAN."
