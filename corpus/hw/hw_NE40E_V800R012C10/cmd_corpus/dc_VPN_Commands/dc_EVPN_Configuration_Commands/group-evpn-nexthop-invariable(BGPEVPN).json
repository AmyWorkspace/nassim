    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default:\nA BGP EVPN speaker changes the next hops of routes to the interface that it uses to establish EBGP EVPN peer relationships before advertising these routes to EBGP EVPN peers.A BGP EVPN speaker changes the next hops of routes imported from EBGP EVPN to the interface that it uses to establish IBGP EVPN peer relationships before advertising these routes to IBGP EVPN peers.An RR does not change the next hops of routes imported from IBGP EVPN when advertising these routes to IBGP EVPN peers.A BGP EVPN speaker changes the next hops of routes to the interface that it uses to establish IBGP EVPN peer relationships before advertising these routes to IBGP EVPN peers.\nIn an inter-AS scenario where an EVPN Route Reflector (RR) is used, the peer next-hop-invariable command needs to be run on the RR to prevent the RR from modifying the Next_Hops of routes before advertising the routes to EBGP peers. This ensures that the remote PE recurses routes to the LSP destined for the local PE during traffic transmission.\nIn an EVPN VXLAN scenario, the peer next-hop-invariable command must be run if a device needs to advertise routes received from an EBGP EVPN peer to IBGP EVPN peers or advertise routes to EBGP EVPN peers.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe specified peer group has been enabled in the BGP-EVPN address family view.\nPrecautions\nIf a device needs to advertise routes to its IBGP peer group, the peer next-hop-invariable and peer next-hop-local commands are mutually exclusive on the device."
