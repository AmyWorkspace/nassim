    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nGenerally, route summarization is configured to control the scale of BGP routing tables. If route summarization is configured for a BGP-VPN instance address family, the locally suppressed specific routes are by default not advertised to BGP EVPN peers. To enable the advertisement of specific routes to all BGP EVPN peers, run the advertise suppressed-detail-route command.\nPrecautions\nThe priority of the global configuration method is lower than the priority of the peer group configuration method or peer configuration method."
