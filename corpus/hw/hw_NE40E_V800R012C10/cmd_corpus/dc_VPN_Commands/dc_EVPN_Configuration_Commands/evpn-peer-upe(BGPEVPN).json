    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN HoVPN scenario, run the peer upe command to specify a device as a UPE. After a UPE is specified on the SPE using the peer upe command, the SPE does not send a specific route to the UPE. If the peer route-policy export command is run on the SPE to configure routing policies for the UPE and certain specific routes can pass the filtration of routing policies, these specific routes can be sent to the UPE.\nAfter you run the peer upe command on an SPE to specify a device as a UPE, the SPE can change the next hops of routes received from the UPE to itself and reflect these routes to the NPE.\nPrerequisites\nA BGP EVPN peer has been created and the BGP-EVPN address family view has been enabled."
