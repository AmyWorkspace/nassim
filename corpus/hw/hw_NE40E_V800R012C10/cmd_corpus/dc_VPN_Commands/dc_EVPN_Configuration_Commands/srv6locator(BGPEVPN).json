    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN L3VPN scenario, if service traffic needs to be carried over an SRv6 tunnel, the segment-routing ipv6 locator evpn command can be run to add the SID attribute to the EVPN routes to be sent. Upon receipt of EVPN routes from a BGP EVPN peer, the local device can recurse routes over an SRv6 tunnel based on the SID attribute carried in routes."
