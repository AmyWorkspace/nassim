    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA DCI is a solution for communication between DCs. In the DCI solution, after the EVPN routes that are received from the DC side and carry the VXLAN encapsulation attribute are regenerated on the DCI-PE, the DCI-PE advertises VPNv4 routes that carry the MPLS encapsulation attribute to the VPNv4 peer on the DCI backbone network.\nPrerequisites\nEVPN route regeneration has been enabled using the peer import reoriginate command."
