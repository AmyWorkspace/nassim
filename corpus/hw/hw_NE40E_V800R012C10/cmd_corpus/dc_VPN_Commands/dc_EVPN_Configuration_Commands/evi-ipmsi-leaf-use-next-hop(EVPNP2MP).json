    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a cross-IGP-area EVPN E-LAN scenario, you must run the root-ip use-next-hop command on a leaf node to configure the next hop of a BGP EVPN route as the root node IP address, which is used as the IP address of the ABR on the area border. Without this configuration, EVPN cannot use an mLDP P2MP tunnel for service transmission."
