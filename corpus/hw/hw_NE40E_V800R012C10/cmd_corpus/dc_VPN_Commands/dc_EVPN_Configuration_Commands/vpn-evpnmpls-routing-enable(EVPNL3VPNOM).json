    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN L3VPN scenario, if MPLS or SR-MPLS tunnels are used as public network tunnels (including splicing scenarios), run the evpn mpls routing-enable command to enable EVPN to generate and advertise IP prefix routes and IRB routes so that the local device can advertise IP prefix routes and IRB routes to EVPN peers. If non-MPLS tunnels such as VXLAN and SRv6 tunnels are used on the public network, you do not need to run this command."
