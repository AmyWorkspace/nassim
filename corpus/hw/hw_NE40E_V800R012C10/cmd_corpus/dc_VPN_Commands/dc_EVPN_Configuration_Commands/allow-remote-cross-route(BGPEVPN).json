    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, remote EVPN routes received from the remote end can only be remotely leaked to the VPN instance. The routes of the VPN instance cannot be locally leaked to other VPN instances. To solve the problem of mutual access between different VPN instances, run the local-cross allow-remote-cross-route command to enable local cross of remote EVPN routes. Then, the remote routes received by EVPN are sent to the VPN instance and then locally leaked to other VPN instances."
