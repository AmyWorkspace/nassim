    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn VPWS EVPN scenarios, the user-side AC interface maps to an EVPL instance. The EVPL instance on a PE is bound to an EVPN instance and the EVPL instance is then bound to the user-side AC interface and network-side MPLS/SR tunnel interface to allow communication between the user-side AC interface and network-side MPLS/SR tunnel interface."
