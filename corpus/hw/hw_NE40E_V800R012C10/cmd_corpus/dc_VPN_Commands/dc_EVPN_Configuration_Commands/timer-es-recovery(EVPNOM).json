    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn Active-Active scenarios, to prevent ES routes from being sent immediately after an Eth-Trunk interface recovers, run the timer es-recovery command. This configuration minimizes packet loss.\nPrecautions\nThe timer es-recovery command will delay the sending of per-ES Ethernet A-D routes.\nThe timer es-recovery command applies only to active-active scenarios. Do not run this command in single-active scenarios. Otherwise, the switchback performance will deteriorate."
