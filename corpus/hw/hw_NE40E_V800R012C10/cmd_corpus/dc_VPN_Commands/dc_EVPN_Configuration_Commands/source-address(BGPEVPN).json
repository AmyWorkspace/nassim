    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command is used to specify an EVPN source address for the device. The EVPN source address is filled in the Originating Router's IP Address field of Inclusive Multicast and Ethernet Segment routes. In addition, the RDs of Ethernet Segment and Ethernet Auto-Discovery Per ES routes are generated based on the EVPN source address.\nThe IP address configured for a source VXLAN tunnel endpoint (VTEP) using the source command cannot be the same as the EVPN source address configured for PE identification using the evpn source-address command."
