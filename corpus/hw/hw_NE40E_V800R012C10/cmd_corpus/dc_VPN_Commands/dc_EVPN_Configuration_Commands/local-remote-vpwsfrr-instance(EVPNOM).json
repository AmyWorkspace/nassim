    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN VPWS multi-homing and single-active scenario, or an EVPN VPWS multi-homing and double-active scenario, a CE is dual-homed to PE1 and PE2. The primary/backup status of PE1 and PE2 is determined by DF election. Suppose PE1 is the primary DF in this example. In normal conditions, downstream traffic on PE3 is sent to PE1. To prevent traffic loss, run the local-remote vpws-frr command on PE1 to enable FRR for AD routes at both local and remote ends of the EVPN VPWS. If PE1 detects a link failure between itself and CE1, this configuration allows PE1 to forward traffic to PE2, which then sends traffic to CE1."
