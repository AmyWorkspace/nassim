    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network where EVPN and L3VPN services are both deployed, a PE does not support EVPN ORF because of running an early version. After an RR establishes BGP-VT peer relationships with all the PEs on the entire network and EVPN ORF is enabled on the other PEs and RR, the PE running an early version cannot exchange EVPN routes with the RR. As a result, EVPN services cannot run properly. To resolve this issue, run the peer vpn-orf disable command to disable the RR from filtering routes based on the IRT for the PE running an early version so that the PE can advertise and receive EVPN routes properly. This ensures that the EVPN services run properly."
