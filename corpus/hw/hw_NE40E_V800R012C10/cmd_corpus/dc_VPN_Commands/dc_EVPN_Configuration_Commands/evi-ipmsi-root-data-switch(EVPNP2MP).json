    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore an mLDP P2MP tunnel carries multicast services, you can establish a bypass tunnel to provide mLDP P2MP FRR protection for the primary mLDP P2MP tunnel. The bypass tunnel is a P2P tunnel. If both the primary P2MP tunnel and bypass P2P tunnel go Down, the backup mLDP P2MP tunnel carries multicast services. After the bypass P2P tunnel for the primary mLDP P2MP tunnel goes Up, the P2P tunnel carries multicast services. Because the primary mLDP P2MP tunnel remains Down, a leaf node also receives multicast traffic from the backup mLDP P2MP tunnel. As a result, the leaf node receives and forwards duplicate copies of traffic.\nTo prevent this issue, run the data-switch disable command. This configuration disables multicast services from being switched to a P2P tunnel once an mLDP P2MP tunnel goes Down. This ensures that a leaf node receives and processes only multicast traffic from the backup mLDP P2MP tunnel."
