    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the DCI or CloudVPN active-active scenario, BUM traffic is sent to PEs in active-active mode. However, a CE requires only one copy of BUM traffic from the PEs, and the other copy of the traffic needs to be blocked. To prevent the CE from receiving duplicate BUM traffic after the faulty PE recovers, run the evpn enhancement port command on the active-active PEs so that they can negotiate one link to forward traffic to the CE.\nPrecautions\nThis command applies only to the Admin-VS."
