    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN L3VPN scenario, if you want to use an SRv6 TE policy to carry service traffic, run the segment-routing ipv6 traffic-engineer evpn command in a specified EVPN L3VPN instance. In this way, EVPN routes recurse to the SRv6 TE policy, and service traffic is forwarded over the SRv6 TE policy.\nTo improve reliability, you can configure the best-effort parameter when an SRv6 BE tunnel exists on the network. With this parameter configured, if the SRv6 TE policy becomes faulty, services can use the SRv6 BE tunnel as a best-effort path.\nPrerequisites\nAn L3VPN instance has been created.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf both the segment-routing ipv6 traffic-engineer evpn command and the segment-routing ipv6 best-effort evpn command are run, a later configuration overrides a previous one."
