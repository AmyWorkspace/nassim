    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, a device generates an IP prefix route based on the IP address in an IRBv6 route that it has received from a BGP EVPN peer. IP prefix routes can be used for Layer 3 traffic forwarding. If Layer 2 forwarding is required, run the irb asymmetric command to enable the asymmetric mode for IRBv6 routes. Specifically, after this configuration is performed, the device does not generate IP prefix routes after receiving IRBv6 routes."
