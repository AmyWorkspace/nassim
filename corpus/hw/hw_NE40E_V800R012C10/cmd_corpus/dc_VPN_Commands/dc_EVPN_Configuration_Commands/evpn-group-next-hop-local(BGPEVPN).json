    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe peer next-hop-local command is usually run on an ASBR. By default, when an ASBR forwards a route learned from an EBGP peer to its IBGP peers, the ASBR does not change the Next_Hop of the route. Therefore, the Next_Hop address of the route remains the EBGP peer IP address. After being forwarded to the IBGP peers, the route cannot become active because of the unreachable Next_Hop. The peer next-hop-local command needs to be run to configure the ASBR to modify the Next_Hop of the route to the local IP address before advertising the route to IBGP peers. After being forwarded to the IBGP peers, the route can be active because the Next_Hop is reachable (an IGP is configured in the AS).\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the peer next-hop-local command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThe peer next-hop-local command is applicable to IBGP peers.\nWhen the BGP device advertises routes to an IBGP peer group, the peer next-hop-local command and the peer next-hop-invariable command are mutually exclusive."
