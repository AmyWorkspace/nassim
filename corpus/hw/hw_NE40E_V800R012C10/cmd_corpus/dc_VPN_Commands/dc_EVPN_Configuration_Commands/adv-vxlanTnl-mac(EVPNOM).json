    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn MetroFabric scenarios with CU separation deployed, MPLS EVPN runs on the metro network, and static VXLAN tunnels are established between metro edge function (MEF) devices and vBRAS-UPs. Therefore, the MEF devices must support MPLS EVPN splicing with static VXLAN to establish E2E forwarding path for traffic. In this case, run the advertise vxlan-tunnel mac command on the MEF devices to enable EVPN to advertise the MAC routes on the static VXLAN tunnel side to the BGP EVPN peers on the MPLS EVPN side."
