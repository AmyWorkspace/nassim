    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the EVPN VPWS multi-homing single-active scenario, a CE is dual-homed to PE1 and PE2, and PE1 is the master. Run the remote vpws-frr enable command on PE3. Normally, PE3 sends downstream traffic to PE1. When PE3 detects a fault between itself and PE1, PE3 forwards traffic to PE2 to prevent traffic loss."
