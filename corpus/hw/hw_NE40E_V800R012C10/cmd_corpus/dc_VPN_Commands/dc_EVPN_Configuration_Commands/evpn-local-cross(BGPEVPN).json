    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the locally imported routes and VPN peer routes of a VPN instance cannot be locally leaked to other VPN instances through EVPN. To resolve this problem, run the local-cross export evpn-rt-match command to enable local EVPN route leaking. After the command is run, the routes imported from the local VPN instance and the routes from the VPN peers can be leaked to other VPN instances."
