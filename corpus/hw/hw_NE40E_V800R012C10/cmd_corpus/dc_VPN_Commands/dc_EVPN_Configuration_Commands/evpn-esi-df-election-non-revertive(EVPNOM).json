    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn multi-homing networking, a CE is dual-homed to PE1 and PE2, and PE1 is elected as the master DF for traffic forwarding because of a higher precedence. If PE3 that has a higher DF precedence than PE1 is deployed on the network, PE3 becomes the master DF, and traffic is switched to PE3 for forwarding. If users do not want traffic switching, run the non-revertive command on PE1 to enable the non-switchback function."
