    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN E-Tree scenario, if a basic EVPN instance is configured, the EVPN instance is bound to an AC interface. If a BD-EVPN instance is configured, the BD-EVPN instance is bound to a BD, and then the BD is associated with the AC interface. By default, the AC interface has the root attribute. To set the leaf attribute for the AC interface to which an EVPN instance is bound, run the etree enable and evpn e-tree-leaf commands. This configuration disables leaf AC interfaces from sending traffic to each other. Only a leaf AC interface and a root AC interface can send traffic to each other.\nPrecautions\nThe etree enable command cannot be run in the following EVPN instances:\nBD-EVPN instance bound to a BD with the vxlan vni split-horizon-mode command configuration.BD-EVPN instance with the inclusive-provider-tunnel command configuration.\nIf you want to run the undo etree enable command, ensure that no local interface with the evpn e-tree-leaf command configuration exists."
