To specify a leaf node and enter the EVI I-PMSI-leaf view for leaf node configurations, run the leaf command.\nPrecautions\nIn a dual-homing scenario, if the dual-homing PEs are configured as root nodes using the root command, the two PEs can no longer be configured as leaf nodes using the leaf command."
