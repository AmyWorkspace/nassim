    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a PE or AC-side link fails, DF election is triggered. If one of the sub-interfaces on the AC interface goes Down but the other sub-interfaces bound to an EVPN instance remain Up, an Ethernet segment (ES) route is not regenerated to trigger DF election, which may cause a traffic forwarding failure.\nAfter the function that the AC status influences DF election is enabled, a PE generates EVI AD routes only when the AC interface is Up. During DF election, the system checks whether the AD routes (including both the ES AD routes and EVI AD routes) advertised by the PE are received to determine whether the PE can participate in election. If AD routes advertised by the PE are not received, the PE does not participate in DF election.\nPrecautions\nMultiple PEs participating in DF election must support the same election rule. Therefore, the function that the AC status influences DF election must be enabled on multi-homed PEs."
