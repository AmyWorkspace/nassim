    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nGenerally, route summarization is configured to control the scale of BGP routing tables. If route summarization is configured for a BGP-VPN instance address family, the locally suppressed specific routes are by default not advertised to BGP EVPN peers. To enable the advertisement of specific routes to a specified BGP EVPN peer, run the peer advertise suppressed-detail-route command.\nPrerequisites\nThe specified peer has been enabled in the BGP-EVPN address family view.\nPrecautions\nThe priority of the peer configuration method is higher than the priorities of the global configuration method and peer group configuration method."
