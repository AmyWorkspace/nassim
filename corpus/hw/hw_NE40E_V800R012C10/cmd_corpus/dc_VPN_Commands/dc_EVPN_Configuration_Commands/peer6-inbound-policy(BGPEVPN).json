    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a route-policy is created, the peer route-policy import command is used to apply a Route-Policy to a peer so that the routes received from the peer can be controlled. To be specific, only the necessary routes are received from the peer. In this manner, route management is implemented, the scale of the routing table is reduced, and fewer network resources are consumed.\nPrerequisites\nIf the command specifies a route-policy, use the route-policy command to create the specified route-policy first.\nConfiguration Impact\nBinding a route-policy after a BGP peer relationship is established may cause peer flapping."
