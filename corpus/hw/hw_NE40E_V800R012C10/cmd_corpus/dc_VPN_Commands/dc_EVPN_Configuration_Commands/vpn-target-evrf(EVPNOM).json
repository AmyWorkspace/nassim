After a PE receives EVPN routes, the PE matches export VPN targets carried in these routes against the local import VPN target list and imports these routes to the local EVPN instance routing table only if at least one export VPN target matches one import VPN target.\nOne vpn-target command configures a maximum of eight VPN targets. To configure more VPN targets, run the vpn-target command several times.\nPrerequisites\nAn RD has been configured for the EVPN instance using the route-distinguisher command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf you do not configure this command, a PE cannot import received EVPN routes to its local EVPN instance routing table.\nAfter all the VPN targets of an EVPN instance are deleted using the undo vpn-target command, all EVPN routes learned by the EVPN instance from other EVPN instances will be deleted."
