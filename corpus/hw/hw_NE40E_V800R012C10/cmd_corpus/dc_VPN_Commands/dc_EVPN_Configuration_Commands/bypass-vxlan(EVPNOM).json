    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the anycast VXLAN scenario, the dual-homed PEs must have the same VTEP address. As a result, the dual-homed PEs cannot use the VTEP address to establish a VXLAN tunnel, causing a traffic forwarding failure. To resolve the problem, run the bypass-vxlan enable command to enable inter-chassis VXLAN on the PEs and configure different bypass addresses for the PEs. In this way, the PEs can use the bypass addresses to establish VXLAN tunnels for traffic forwarding."
