You can also use this command to enable a device to re-encapsulate IRBv6 routes into IPv6 prefix routes and ND routes.\nThe undo irb-reoriginated compatible command restores the default configuration.\nBy default, a device is not enabled to re-encapsulate IRB routes into IP prefix routes or ARP routes. A device is not enabled to re-encapsulate IRBv6 routes into IPv6 prefix routes or ND routes either.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf you want to convert the IRB routes carrying the network segment address of a tenant host that are received by a device into host IP prefix routes or ARP routes, or convert the IRBv6 routes carrying the IPv6 network segment address of a tenant host that are received by a device into host IPv6 prefix routes or ND routes, run the irb-reoriginated compatible command to enable the device to re-encapsulate IRB or IRBv6 routes into the desired routes."
