    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFull-mesh connections need to be established between IBGP peers in an AS to ensure the connectivity between the IBGP peers. When there are many IBGP peers, it is costly to establish a fully-meshed network. An RR or a confederation can be used to solve the problem. Only the IBGP route of which route-target extended community attribute meets the matching rules can be reflected. This allows load balancing among RRs."
