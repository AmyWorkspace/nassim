    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf you want a device to function as a distributed gateway and learn only the ARP or ND packets sent from a user host, run the anycast-gateway enable command. A device enabled with the anycast distributed gateway function can:\nProcess the ARP or ND packets received only from a user host and generate host routes.Delete the learned network-side ARP or ND packets and the corresponding host routes.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIn distributed scenarios, if the IP addresses of multiple VBDIF interfaces are the same, the device enabled with the anycast distributed gateway function does not report ARP or ND conflict alarms."
