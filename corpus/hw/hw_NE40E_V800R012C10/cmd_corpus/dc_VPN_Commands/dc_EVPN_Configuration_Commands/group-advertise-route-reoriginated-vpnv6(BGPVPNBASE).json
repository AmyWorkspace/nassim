    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA DCI is a solution for communication between DCs. In the DCI solution, after the EVPN routes that are received from the DC side and carry the VXLAN encapsulation attribute are regenerated on the DCI-PE, the DCI-PE advertises VPNv6 routes that carry the MPLS encapsulation attribute to the VPNv6 peer group on the DCI backbone network.\nPrerequisites\nEVPN route regeneration has been enabled using the peer import reoriginate command."
