    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a PE connects to two other PEs, running the vpn frr command on PE enables VPN FRR and improves network reliability. When a fault occurs on the primary tunnel, a PE configured with VPN FRR can switch VPN traffic to the secondary tunnel before the VPN routes are converged.\nPrerequisites\nThe VPN instance RD has been configured by running the route-distinguisher command in the VPN instance view."
