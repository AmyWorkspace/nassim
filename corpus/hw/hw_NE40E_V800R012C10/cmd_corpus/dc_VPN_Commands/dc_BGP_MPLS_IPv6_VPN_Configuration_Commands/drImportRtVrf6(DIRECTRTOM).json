    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a BGP/MPLS IP VPN scenario, one VPN can communicate with another VPN if they have matching VPN targets, but VPNs cannot communicate with the public network. To enable a VPN to communicate with the public network, you have to ensure that the VPN and public network can obtain routes to each other. To import public network routes to a VPN instance, run the import-rib protocol direct command.\nIn an intelligent traffic control scenario, traffic of different users are distributed to different VPNs. To enable the traffic to reach the public network, run the import-rib protocol direct command to import public network routes to each VPN instance routing table."
