An AS number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535, and a user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 4294967295. The AS and user-defined numbers cannot be both 0s.

An AS number is an integer ranging from 65536 to 4294967295, and a user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535.4-byte AS number in dotted notation:2-byte user-defined number, for example, 0.0:3 or 0.1:0. A 4-byte AS number in dotted notation is in the format of x.y, where x and y are integers ranging from 0 to 65535. A user-defined number is an integer ranging from 0 to 65535. The AS and user-defined numbers cannot be both 0s. This means that a VPN target cannot be 0.0:0.32-bit IP address:2-byte user-defined number. For example, 192.168.122.15:1.
