    "FuncDef": "The apply-label per-route pop-go command configures the egress of a BGP LSP to forward a data packet received from the LSP through the outbound interface found in the ILM based on the label carried in the packet.\nThe undo apply-label per-route pop-go command restores the default configuration.\nBy default, after the egress of a BGP LSP receives a labeled data packet from the LSP, the egress removes the label of the data packet and forwards the packet based on a forwarding entry found in the IP forwarding table according to the longest-match principle.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the apply-label per-route pop-go command is configured on the egress of a BGP LSP, after the local Device receives a data packet from peer Device, the local Device directly searches the ILM for an outbound interface based on label information carried in the packet and forwards the packet through the found outbound interface after removing the packet label. This implementation ensures correct packet forwarding."
