    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf no import route-filter is configured, routes can only be filtered based on export VPN targets. The routes whose export VPN targets match the import VPN target of the local VPN instance IPv4 address family are added to the VPN instance IPv4 address family. To control the import of the routes into the VPN instance IPv4 address family more precisely, use the import route-filter. The import route-filter is used to filter the imported routing information and to set the routing attributes of the routes that pass the filtering.\nThe import route-filter command controls the VPN routes that are added to a VPN instance IPv4 address family. The peer route-filter command run in the BGP VPN instance IPv4 address family view filters routes of a VPN instance IPv4 address family advertised to or received from CE neighbors.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe current VPN instance IPv4 address family can be associated with only one import route-filter. If the import route-filter command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nFollow-up Procedure\nIf the import route-filter to be associated with a VPN instance IPv4 address family does not exist, configure the import route-filter."
