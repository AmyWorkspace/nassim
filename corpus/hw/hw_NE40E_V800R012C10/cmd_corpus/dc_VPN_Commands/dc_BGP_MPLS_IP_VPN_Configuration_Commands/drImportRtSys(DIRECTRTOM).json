    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a BGP/MPLS IP VPN scenario, one VPN can communicate with another VPN if they have matching VPN targets, but VPNs cannot communicate with the public network. To enable a VPN to communicate with the public network, you have to ensure that the VPN and public network can obtain routes to each other. To import the VPN instance routes to public network, run the ip import-rib vpn-instance command.\nIn an intelligent traffic control scenario, traffic of different users are distributed to different VPNs. To enable public-network traffic to reach the VPNs, run the ip import-rib vpn-instance command to import routes in each VPN instance routing table to the public network routing table.\nTraffic forwarding relies on direct routes (Vlink direct routes) generated based on user entries. When QinQ or Dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces are used for route import between VPN and public network, Vlink direct routes cannot be imported. As a result, traffic forwarding is interrupted. To solve this problem, route import between VPN and public network newly supports import of Vlink direct routes.\nPrecautions\nIf you run the ip import-rib vpn-instance command on a device without adding the valid-route, the device will import the optimal IP route of the specified type from the specified VPN instance to the public network instance's corresponding routing table. If the imported route is preferred in this routing table, the device will advertise the route to other devices and deliver the route to the IP routing table to guide traffic forwarding.\nIf you run the ip import-rib vpn-instance command with only the valid-route keyword added, the device will import the valid IP routes of the specified type from the specified VPN instance to the public network instance's corresponding routing table. If the imported routes are preferred in this routing table, the device will advertise these routes to other devices and deliver these routes to the IP routing table to guide traffic forwarding."
