If the tunnels between PEs are not LSPs, the display ip vpn-instance command does not display tunnel information.\" jquery17200643334241912969=\"287\">To view the configurations of VPN instances, interfaces bound to them, and LSPs associated with them, run the display ip vpn-instance command. Since VPN instances support IPv4 and IPv6 address families, the display ip vpn-instance command displays the information of different address families separately.\nIf vpn-instance-name is not specified, the display ip vpn-instance command displays information about all configured VPN instances on a PE.\nIf interface is specified, the display ip vpn-instance command displays all interfaces bound to the specified VPN instance.\nIf tunnel-info is specified, the display ip vpn-instance command displays information about the LSPs to which the routes of the VPN instance enabled with the IPv4 or IPv6 address family recurse (in other words, information about the LSPs between PEs). If the tunnels between PEs are not LSPs, the display ip vpn-instance command does not display tunnel information.\nBy specifying the keywords tunnel-info and nexthop, you can view information about the iterations of the routes that match the nexthop under each address family in the current VPN instance."
