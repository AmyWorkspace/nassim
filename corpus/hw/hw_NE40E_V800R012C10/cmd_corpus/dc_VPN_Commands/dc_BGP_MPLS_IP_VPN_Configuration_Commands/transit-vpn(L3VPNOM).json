    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAccording to relevant standards, the status of a VRF obtained from the NMS is Up only if it is bound to at least one interface in the Up state. In HoVPN networking, however, a VRF does not need to be bound to any interface. If a VRF is not bound to an interface in this networking, the status of the VRF obtained from the MIB is Down by default.\nTo ensure that the status of a VRF obtained from the NMS is always Up, run the transit-vpn command."
