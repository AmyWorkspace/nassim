    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an RD is not automatically assigned to an address family of a VPN instance by default, manually allocating RDs may cause RD conflicts if a large number of VPN instances need to be created and a large number of RDs are planned. To solve this problem, you can run the route route-distinguisher auto command to enable the automatic RD allocation function. In this command, set the rd-ip parameter to an IPv4 address. RDs in the format of IP-address:index can be automatically assigned to all VPN instances that have no allocated RDs. An index is an automatically allocated 2-byte number ranging from 1 to 65535."
