    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an HVPN or inter-AS VPN Option B scenario, if an SPE or ASBR does not have sufficient MPLS label resources for VPN routes, run the apply-label per-nexthop command to minimize MPLS label consumption on the SPE or ASBR.\nBy default, an SPE or ASBR assigns a unique label to each VPN route to be advertised to its MP-BGP peers. After the apply-label per-nexthop command is run, the SPE or ASBR assigns only one label to routes that share the same next hop and outgoing label. To ensure that the routes learned by an SPE or ASBR from the same next hop have the same outgoing label, run the apply-label per-instance command on each PE. Otherwise, the apply-label per-nexthop command does not take effect.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter one-label-per-next-hop label distribution is enabled or disabled, the labels assigned by the SPE or ASBR to routes change. As a result, temporary packet loss may occur."
