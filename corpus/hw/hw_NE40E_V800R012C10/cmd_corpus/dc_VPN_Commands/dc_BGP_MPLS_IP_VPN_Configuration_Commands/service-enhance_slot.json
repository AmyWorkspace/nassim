    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nType-B boards cannot support L3VPN or MVPN services without loading the GTL license file.\nTo configure L3VPN or MVPN services on these interface boards, you must buy a valid GTL license file and run the service-enhance slot command to load the license file to the interface board.\nPrerequisites\nUpload the GTL license file to the CF card of an MPU and run the license active command to activate the license.\nFollow-up Procedure\nConfigure L3VPN and MVPN services on an interface board.\nPrecautions\nThe service-enhance slot command applies only to type-B boards. Other types of boards or unregistered boards do not support this command.\nAfter you disable L3VPN or MVPN, L3PVN or MVPN services are not supported. Exercise caution when running the undo service-enhance slot command. After the GTL license file expires, buy a new valid GTL license file in time. Otherwise, L3VPN or MVPN services on boards may be influenced."
