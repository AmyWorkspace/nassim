    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter creating a VPN instance, you must associate the PE interface connecting to the VPN with the VPN instance. Then, the interface is used as a private network interface on which a private network address and a private network routing protocol can be configured.\nPrerequisites\nA VPN instance has been configured using the ip vpn-instance command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter an interface is associated with a VPN instance or an interface is disassociated from a VPN instance, the Layer 3 features on this interface, such as the IP address and routing protocol, are deleted. The Layer 3 features need to be reconfigured if required.\nPrecautions\nUsing the undo ipv4-family or undo ipv6 family command to disable the IPv4 or IPv6 address family also deletes the IPv4 or IPv6 configurations of the interfaces bound to the VPN instance.\nIf the ip binding vpn-instance command is to be run on a VE sub-interface, the VE sub-interface must be an L3VE sub-interface. To configure an L3VE sub-interface, run the ve-group command."
