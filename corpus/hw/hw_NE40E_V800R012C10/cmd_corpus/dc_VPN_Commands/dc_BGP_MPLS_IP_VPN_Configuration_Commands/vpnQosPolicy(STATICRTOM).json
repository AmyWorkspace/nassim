    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo perform traffic statistics collection, authentication, and accounting based on static routes, run the ip static-routing-table route-policy (VPN instance view) command to apply a routing policy to static routes in the VPN instance IPv4 address family so that QoS information, such as the traffic behavior or local ID that is associated with the static routes, can be set for QoS information management.\nPrerequisites\nThe routing policy has been configured using the route-policy command.For static routes, they are categorized based on the ACL, address prefix list, and route tag.\n\nPrecautions\nTo apply a routing policy to static routes in the VPN instance IPv4 address family, run the ip route-policy (VPN instance IPv4 address family view) command. To apply a routing policy to static routes in the public network routing table, run the ip route-policy (system view) command."
