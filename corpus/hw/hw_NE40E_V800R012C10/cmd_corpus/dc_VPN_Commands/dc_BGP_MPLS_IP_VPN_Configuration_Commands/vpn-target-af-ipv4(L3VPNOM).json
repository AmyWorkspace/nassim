    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a local PE advertises VPNv4 routes to peer PEs, the VPNv4 routes carry all the export VPN targets of the local VPN instance IPv4 address family. The received VPNv4 routes can be added to the routing table of the local VPN instance IPv4 address family only when their VPN targets belong to the list of import VPN targets of the local VPN instance IPv4 address family. To configure VPN targets for a VPN instance IPv4 address family, run the vpn-target command.\nA maximum of eight VPN targets can be specified in the vpn-target command. If you want to configure more VPN targets in a VPN instance IPv4 address family view, run the vpn-target command more than once.\nPrerequisites\nA route distinguisher (RD) has been configured for the VPN instance IPv4 address family using the route-distinguisher command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the vpn-target command is not used, a PE does not install received VPNv4 routes into the routing table of its VPN instance IPv4 address family.\nIf all the VPN targets of the IPv4 address family of a VPN instance are deleted using the undo vpn-target command, all routes learned by the IPv4 address family of the VPN instance from other VPN instances will be deleted.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the ipv4-family vpn-instance command in the BGP view to synchronize the VPN targets of the VPN instance IPv4 address family to the BGP VPN instance IPv4 address family."
