    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn BGP/MPLS IPv6 VPN networking, IPv6 users of two VPNs with matching VPN targets can communicate, but IPv6 VPN users cannot communicate with IPv6 public network users. To enable IPv6 VPN users to communicate with IPv6 public network users, you must configure IPv6 route import between VPN and public network instances. To enable a device to import IPv6 routes from a VPN instance to the public network instance, run the ipv6 import-rib vpn-instance command.\nTraffic forwarding relies on direct routes (Vlink direct routes) generated based on user entries. When QinQ or Dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interfaces are used for route import between VPN and public network, Vlink direct routes cannot be imported. As a result, traffic forwarding is interrupted. To solve this problem, route import between VPN and public network newly supports import of Vlink direct routes.\nPrecautions\nIf you run the ipv6 import-rib vpn-instance command on a device without adding the valid-route keyword, the device will import the optimal IPv6 route of the specified type from the specified VPN instance to the public network instance's corresponding routing table. If the imported route is preferred in this routing table, the device will advertise the route to other devices and deliver the route to the IPv6 routing table to guide traffic forwarding.\nIf you run the ipv6 import-rib vpn-instance command with only the valid-route keyword added, the device will import the valid IPv6 routes of the specified type from the specified VPN instance to the public network instance's corresponding routing table. If the imported routes are preferred in this routing table, the device will advertise these routes to other devices and deliver these routes to the IPv6 routing table to guide traffic forwarding."
