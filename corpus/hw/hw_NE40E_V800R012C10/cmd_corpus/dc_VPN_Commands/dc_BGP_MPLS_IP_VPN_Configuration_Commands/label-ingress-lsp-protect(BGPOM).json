    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a seamless MPLS scenario, to improve service reliability, configure BGP FRR on the ingress of a BGP LSP and then run the bestroute nexthop-resolved tunnel and ingress-lsp protect-mode bgp-frr commands, implementing BGP LSP FRR protection. If the primary BGP LSP fails, services can be quickly switched to the backup BGP LSP, minimizing the duration of traffic interruption.\nPrerequisites\nBGP auto FRR has been enabled.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the ingress-lsp trigger command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIt is recommended that the selection of labeled BGP IPv4 routes be based on the bestroute nexthop-resolved command."
