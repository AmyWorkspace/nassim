    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn I-SID uniquely identifies a broadcast domain. One I-EVPN instance corresponds to one I-SID. If two PEs share the same I-SID, the two PEs belong to the same BUM group.\nPrecautions\nOnly an I-EVPN instance with an I-SID configured can be bound to a B-EVPN instance.\nRunning the undo pbb i-tag command unbinds an I-EVPN instance from a B-EVPN instance and deletes the B-MAC address configured for the I-EVPN instance.\nAn I-SID cannot be modified after being configured. To change an I-SID, delete it using the undo pbb i-tag command and reconfigure a new one using the pbb i-tag command."
