    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPBB-EVPN uses the MAC-in-MAC technique to forward user packets over an EVPN. Specifically, PBB-EVPN adds backbone MAC (B-MAC) addresses before customer MAC (C-MAC) addresses in user packets and enables PEs to transmit these user packets based only on these B-MAC addresses. PEs' control planes have to learn only the B-MAC addresses of other PEs.\nPrecautions\nIf an I-EVPN instance does not have an I-tag, it cannot have a B-MAC address configured."
