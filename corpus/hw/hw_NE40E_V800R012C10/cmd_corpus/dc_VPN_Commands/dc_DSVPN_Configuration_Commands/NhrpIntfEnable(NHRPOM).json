Communication between the HQ and branches and between different branches is involved. To reduce costs, the DSVPN solution is used to interconnect the HQ to branches. NHRP is used to allow the source Spoke node on an NBMA network to obtain dynamic public addresses from destination Spoke nodes.\nPrerequisites\nNHRP must be enabled globally before it can be enabled on an interface.\nRun the system-view command to enter the system view.Run the nhrp enable command to enable NHRP globally.Run the tunnel-protocol gre p2mp command to configure the encapsulation mode of the tunnel interface as mGRE.Run the nhrp enable command to enable NHRP on the tunnel interface."
