    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe hub sends NHRP Redirect packets to the source spoke while forwarding data flows within the DSVPN domain. Run the nhrp shortcut command on the spoke to allow it to send NHRP Resolution Request packets to the destination spoke after it receives NHRP Redirect packets sent from the hub. A tunnel is directly established between two branches.\nPrerequisites\nThe following operations have been performed:\nRun the interface tunnel command to create a tunnel interface and display the tunnel interface view.Run the tunnel-protocol gre p2mp command to set the tunnel encapsulation mode to mGRE.\n\nPrecautions\nThe NHRP shortcut function must work with the NHRP redirect function. Therefore, the NHRP redirect function must be enabled on the hub using the nhrp redirect command."
