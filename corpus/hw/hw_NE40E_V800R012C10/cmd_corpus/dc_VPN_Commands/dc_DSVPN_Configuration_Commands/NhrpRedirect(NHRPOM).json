    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the shortcut scenario, enable the NHRP redirect function on the hub. The hub sends NHRP Redirect packets to the source spoke while forwarding data flows within the DSVPN domain. After receiving the NHRP Redirect packets, the source spoke sends NHRP Resolution Request packets and then establishes a tunnel to communicate with the destination spoke.\nPrerequisites\nThe following operations have been performed:\nRun the interface tunnel command to create a tunnel interface and display the tunnel interface view.Run the tunnel-protocol gre p2mp command to set the tunnel encapsulation mode to mGRE.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you run this command on the hub, it takes effect no matter the NHRP shortcut function is enabled on a spoke or not. When you disable the NHRP shortcut function on spoke, the hub sends an NHRP Redirect packet whenever a data packet is received, this cause the wasting of CPU and network resources. Enabling the NHRP shortcut function on a spoke solves this problem.\nPrecautions\nTo allow two branches to directly communicate by establishing a tunnel, you must also enable the nhrp shortcut function on spokes."
