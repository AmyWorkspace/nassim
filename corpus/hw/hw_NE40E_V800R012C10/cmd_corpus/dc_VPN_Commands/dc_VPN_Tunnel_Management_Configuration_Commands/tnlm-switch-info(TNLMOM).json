    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA TE tunnel can be bound to different destination IP addresses using the tunnel binding command. If one of the destination addresses is not bound to a tunnel using the tunnel binding command, the tunnel management module searches for a tunnel based on the default policy. By default, a tunnel policy uses only LSP tunnels for recursion. If you want to use a non-default tunnel for recursion, run the tunnel policy binding-default down-switch enable command to configure a tunnel policy that selects a tunnel (in order of preference: LSP, TE, and GRE). LSP tunnels include LDP LSPs, BGP LSPs, and SR LSPs, which are in descending order of preference."
