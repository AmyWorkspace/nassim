    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a traditional BGP/MPLS inter-AS Option B or Option C VPN, you can configure a tunnel selector for ASBRs or PEs to recurse received VPNv4 routes to multiple types of tunnels, increasing networking flexibility. Bandwidth for VPNv4 routes can be guaranteed if they recurse to TE tunnels. The display tunnel-selector command displays the matching modes, node numbers, filter criteria lists, and clause lists of tunnel selectors, allowing you to determine whether tunnel selectors are correctly configured. If you already know the name of a tunnel selector, you can set the name parameter in the display tunnel-selector command to check information about the specified tunnel selector. If you do not set the name parameter, information about all tunnel selectors is displayed."
