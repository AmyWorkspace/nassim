    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an L2VPN accessing L3VPN scenario, if the L2VPN service goes faulty, the L3VE interface goes Down accordingly, causing the L3VPN service to go faulty. By default, the L3VE interface goes Up immediately after the L2VPN service recovers, triggering the activation of the L3VPN service. If a large number of services are running, the L3VPN service may be activated before entries are delivered to the forwarding plane for the L2VPN service. As a result, the Layer 2 traffic is interrupted, whereas the Layer 3 traffic can be forwarded. To prevent this problem, run the mpls l2vpn l3ve delay-up command to configure a delay for the L3VE interface to go Up. The L3VE interface can go Up after the L2VPN service recovers, then activating the L3VPN service."
