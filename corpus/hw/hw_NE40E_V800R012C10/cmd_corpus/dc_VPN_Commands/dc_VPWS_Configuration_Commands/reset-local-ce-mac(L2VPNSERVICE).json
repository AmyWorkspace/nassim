    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a scenario in which IP interworking is configured on an Ethernet AC interface of a PE, if the VLAN ID of the interface used by the CE to access the PE changes or the access interface changes, you can use the reset local-ce mac command to clear the MAC address of the access interface and the VLAN ID. Then, the PE can learn the new information about the access interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf you specify the number and type of an interface, information about the specified interface is deleted. Otherwise, all the MAC addresses and VLAN IDs dynamically learned by the local CE are deleted."
