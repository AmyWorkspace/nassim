    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nBy default, an L2VPN service is uniquely identified by a combination of the VC ID and VC type, which are hard to remember. This does not facilitate maintenance. If a service name is used to uniquely identify an L2VPN service, the name can be defined as required and the NMS operator can directly maintain the L2VPN service identified by the name on the NMS. This simplifies operation and facilitates maintenance.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nVPWS has been configured on a service interface.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nOn a PE, an L2VPN service name is unique. If an L2VPN service name has been used by a PW, it cannot be configured for another PW. Otherwise, the configuration fails.\nIf an L2VPN service already has a name, this service name will be overwritten when a new name is configured for the L2VPN service. Therefore, you can directly configure a new service name without deleting the original one to change an L2VPN service name.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\n\nAfter a service name is configured for an L2VPN service, the NMS operator can maintain (query, modify, or delete) the L2VPN service identified by the service name on the NMS.\n\nPrecautions\n\n\nBecause the primary and secondary PWs are configured on the same interface, they are regarded as one PW, and a service name is configured for both of them.\nOn a PE, an L2VPN service name is unique.\nThe L2VPN service name is not supported for the circuit cross connect (CCC) VPWS connection."
