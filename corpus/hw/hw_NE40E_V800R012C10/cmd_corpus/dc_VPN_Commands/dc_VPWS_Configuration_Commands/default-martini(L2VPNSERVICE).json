    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAccording to initial drafts, LDP PW endpoints do not support Notification messages. Relevant standards, however, defines that LDP PW endpoints can use Notification messages for service processing. Before configuring a device that supports Notification messages to communicate with a device that does not support Notification messages over an LDP PW, run the mpls l2vpn default martini command on the device that supports Notification messages.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS L2VPN has been enabled using the mpls l2vpn command.\nPrecautions\nThe mpls l2vpn default martini command can only be run on devices that do not have VPWS or VPLS services. If you need to run this command on a device that has VPWS or VPLS services, delete these services first.\nPW redundancy cannot work properly in LDP mode."
