    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nOn a network configured with PW redundancy, the mpls l2vpn stream-dual-receiving command must be run on a PE to which a CE is dual-homed, so that the PE can receive packets from both the primary and secondary PWs.\nIf the command is not run, the PE receives packets only from the primary PW. This causes packet loss during a traffic switchback. After the primary PW recovers and a traffic switchback is triggered, the secondary PW on the PE becomes the primary PW and the PE notifies the peer of the status change. A delay in signaling transmission causes the peer PE to send packets along the secondary PW. After the PE receiving packets from the secondary PW, the PE discards the packets.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe primary and secondary PWs have been configured.\n\nPrecautions\n\nThe mpls l2vpn stream-dual-receiving command applies only to PWE3 L2VPN. If hierarchical virtual private LAN service (HVPLS) is configured, the command cannot be configured. If you configure this command, unidirectional broadcast traffic will be looped back."
