    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nTo accelerate PW fault detection, BFD is generally used. When a large number of service PWs originated from the same source and destined for the same device are available, a large number of BFD sessions are required, which consumes lots of resources. To reduce the consumption of public network link bandwidths and system resources, configure an mPW that has the same source and destination as the service PWs and bind the service PWs to the mPW. This configuration allows the service PWs to track the mPW status. Therefore, a BFD session can be configured only for the mPW to detect faults. The mPW then notifies all service PWs bound to it of the status. This allows the BFD session to also monitor the service PWs.\nTo bind service PWs to an mPW so that the service PW status is determined by the mPW status, run the mpls l2vc track admin-vc command.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA service PW has been created using the mpls l2vc command, and an mPW has been created using the\nmpls l2vc admin command. Note that:\n\nThe peer IP addresses of the service PWs and mPW must be the same.\nOne service PW can be bound only to one mPW.\nService PWs with the same peer IP address can be bound only to the same mPW.\n\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter service PWs are bound to an mPW, the mPW is used to detect public network link faults:\n\nIf the mPW status remains unchanged, the service PW status also remains unchanged.\nIf the mPW detects a public network link fault, the mPW goes Down and notifies all service PWs bound to it.\nIf the service PWs are primary and secondary PWs, a PW switchover is triggered.\nIf the service PWs are not primary and secondary PWs, the service PWs go Down and no longer forward traffic.\nAfter the fault is rectified, the mPW goes Up. If the service PWs are primary and secondary PWs, a PW switchback is performed based on the configured switchback policy. If the service PWs are not primary and secondary PWs, the service PWs also go Up. Then the service PWs can be used to forward traffic again.\n\n\nPrecautions\n\nThe mpls l2vc track admin-vc command applies to primary and secondary PWs on PEs but not to multi-segment PWs."
