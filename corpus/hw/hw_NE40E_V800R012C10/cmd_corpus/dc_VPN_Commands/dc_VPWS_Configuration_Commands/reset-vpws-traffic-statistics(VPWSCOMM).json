    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe system starts to collect VPWS PW traffic statistics after the function to collect VPWS PW traffic statistics is enabled. To clear these traffic statistics, run the reset traffic-statistics l2vpn pw command. To view VPWS PW traffic statistics collected during a specified period of time for the network monitoring or troubleshooting purpose, use the reset traffic-statistics l2vpn pw and display traffic-statistics l2vpn pw commands together.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the reset traffic-statistics l2vpn pw command is run, the system clears existing VPWS PW traffic statistics and recollects VPWS PW traffic statistics."
