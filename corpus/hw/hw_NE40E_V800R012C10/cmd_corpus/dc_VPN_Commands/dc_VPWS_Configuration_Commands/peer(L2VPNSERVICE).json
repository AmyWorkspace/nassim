    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nInitially, draft states that LDP PWs cannot use Notification messages. Later, relevant standards states that LDP PWs can use Notification messages to process services. To enable a device supporting Notification messages to communicate with a device not supporting Notification messages, the default-martini command must be run to disable PWs from sending Notification messages. Because a PW has to be configured in the L2VPN peer view, you must run the peer command to create the L2VPN peer view first.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS L2VPN has been enabled using the mpls l2vpn command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the default-martini command to disable LDP PWs from sending Notification messages.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo peer command will delete the L2VPN peer view and all configurations in the view."
