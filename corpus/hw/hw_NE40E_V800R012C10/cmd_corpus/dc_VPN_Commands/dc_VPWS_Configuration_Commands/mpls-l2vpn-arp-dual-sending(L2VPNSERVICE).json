If a dynamic ARP entry is not updated before its life cycle expires, this dynamic ARP entry will be deleted from the ARP table. The life cycle is called aging time. If the entry is updated before its life cycle expires, the aging time of the entry is recalculated. The expire-time expire-time-value parameter allows you to specify an aging time for dynamic ARP entries.\nThe value is an integer ranging from 60 to 4294967295, in seconds. The default value is 4294967295. If the value is 4294967295, dynamic ARP entries do not age."

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIn L2VPN PW redundancy (1:1 protection), user-side ARP packets are transparently transmitted only on the primary PW. As a result, user-side MAC addresses cannot be learned on the secondary PW. When a node fault occurs on the primary PW, the secondary PW needs to trigger the learning of user-side MAC address using traffic. This causes traffic loss.\nThis command enables ARP packets to be transparently transmitted on primary and secondary PWs, minimizing traffic loss in the case of a node fault on the primary PW.\n\nPrecautions\n\nAfter this command is used, normal service packets are transparently transmitted only on the primary PW.\nThis command can be configured on an interface that is not configured with PW redundancy, but the command configuration will not take effect."
