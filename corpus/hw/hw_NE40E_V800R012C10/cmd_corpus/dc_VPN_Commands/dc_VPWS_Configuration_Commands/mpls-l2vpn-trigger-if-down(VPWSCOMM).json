    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an MPLS network where a GE main interface, a 100GE interface, a 10GE WAN interface or a 10GE LAN interface is configured with a remote LDP VPWS connection, you can configure physical layer fault notification to expedite fault detection, so that upper-layer applications can quickly recover after a physical layer fault occurs.\nAfter the notification of physical layer faults is enabled:\nIf a physical layer fault occurs on the PW side, the local AC interface is Down.If a physical layer fault occurs on the AC side, the local PE notifies the peer PE of the fault and the peer AC interface is Down.After the fault is rectified, the Down AC interface automatically becomes Up.\nPre-configuration Tasks\nAn LDP PW has been created using the mpls l2vc command.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn LDP PW has been created using the mpls l2vc command."
