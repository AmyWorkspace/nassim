    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a device is unable to support a large number of LDP sessions, or if you want to manually manage and allocate VC labels, use the undo mpls static-l2vc command to create static PWs. When you configure VC labels to create PWs, Layer 2 VC or link information does not need to be transmitted using LDP.\nTo configure static PWs, create the static primary PW first.\nStatic VCs must be created on the PEs at both ends. The destination address of a VC is the IP address of the peer PE. The transmit label of the PE at one end is the receive label of the PE at the other end.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS has been enabled in the system view.MPLS L2VPN has been enabled in the system view.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a static PW is configured on an AC interface, the Layer 3 features of the interface, such as the IP address and routing protocol, will not take effect. An interface cannot serve as both an L2VPN AC interface and an L3VPN AC interface. If an interface is bound to both a PW and an L3VPN, only the PW configuration takes effect on the interface. After the PW is deleted, the L3VPN configuration will take effect on the interface.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display mpls static-l2vc command to view PW configurations.\nPrecautions\nSince the static secondary PW protects the static primary PW, you cannot configure the static secondary PW before configuring the static primary PW. If you attempt to configure the static secondary PW before the static primary PW, the attempt fails. For the same reason, when deleting PWs, delete the static secondary PW and then the static primary PW.\nIn a PW redundancy scenario, configure the same parameters for the primary, secondary, and bypass PWs. A parameter inconsistency causes the secondary or bypass PW to fail to take over traffic if the primary PW fails.\nThe secondary PWs cannot be created on the same AC interface.\nIf VCCV is not required for a static VC, VC ID does not need to be specified. If VCCV is required, VC ID must be specified.\nIf a sub-interface is bound to a PW, the sub-interface can be deleted only after the binding is removed.If a sub-interface is bound to a PW, you cannot change the encapsulation type of the main interface.\nWhen configuring static VCs, note the following:\nThe transmit label of the VRP ranges from 0 to 1048575, allowing the VRP to interwork with different types of devices.The receive label of the VRP ranges from 16 to 1023. Packets with labels not in this range will be dropped by the VRP.\nWhen PWs are used to carry ATM services, ATM cells are encapsulated into packets for transmission. max-atm-cells indicates the maximum number of ATM cells to be encapsulated into a packet that can be received by a device. After this parameter is set on a device, the device sends the parameter value to its remote device. atm-pack-overtime indicates the ATM cell encapsulation period. If the number of ATM cells is less than the configured maximum number allowed to be encapsulated into a packet, but the ATM cell encapsulation period elapses, the device encapsulates the existing ATM cells into a packet. This ensures real-time data transmission."
