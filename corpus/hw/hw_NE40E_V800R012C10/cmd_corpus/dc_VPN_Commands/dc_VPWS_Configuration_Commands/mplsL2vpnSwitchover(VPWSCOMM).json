    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn master/slave PW redundancy mode, the traffic is transmitted over the primary PW in normal situations. If you want the traffic to be transmitted over the secondary PW due to reasons such as device upgrade or service re-deployment, you can use the mpls l2vpn switchover command to forcibly switch traffic from the primary PW to the secondary PW. After the device is upgraded or services are re-deployed, you can run the undo mpls l2vpn switchover command to forcibly switch traffic from the secondary PW to the primary PW.\nThe mpls l2vpn switchover command can be configured only in the scenario where PW redundancy in master/slave mode is configured. In the scenario of VLL FRR, run the mpls l2vpn reroute command to manually switch traffic from the primary PW to the secondary PW.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the mpls l2vpn switchover command is run, the following cases may occur:\nIf the secondary PW works normally, traffic is not switched back to the primary PW.If the secondary PW fails after or during the traffic switchover, traffic is switched back to the primary PW.After the undo mpls l2vpn switchover command is run, traffic is switched back to the primary PW.\n\nPrecautions\nBefore running the mpls l2vpn switchover command, ensure that the secondary PW is normal and can forward traffic. Otherwise, the switchover will fail.Before running the undo mpls l2vpn switchover command, ensure that the primary PW is normal and can forward traffic. Otherwise, the switchback will fail."
