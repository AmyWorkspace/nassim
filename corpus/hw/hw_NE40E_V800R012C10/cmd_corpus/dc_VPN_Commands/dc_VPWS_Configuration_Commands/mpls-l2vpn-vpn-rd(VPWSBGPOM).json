An RD uniquely identifies an MPLS L2VPN instance on a PE.\nPrerequisites\nThe MPLS-L2VPN instance view has been displayed using the mpls l2vpn  command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAn RD cannot be directly changed after it is configured for an MPLS L2VPN instance. To change an RD:\nDelete and then re-configure it.Delete the current MPLS L2VPN instance and then re-create a new one using the desired RD.\n\nPrecautions\nThe RDs for different MPLS L2VPN instances must be different on the same PE, but can be the same on different PEs."
