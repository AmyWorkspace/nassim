    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the VLL EVPN network, if there is an edge access device UPE implementation is not standard, the message tag package layer uncertainty, resulting in the existence of PW package type of VLAN, but only two layers tag. In this case, it is necessary to configure the command under the PW-VE main interface of the NPE device, to realize the PW in accordance with the VLAN encapsulation method, and the packet of the forwarding surface is ethernet raw mode to avoid the PW when forwarding the packet.\nPrecautions\nThis function is only available under the PW-VE main interface. This command does not affect the local remote negotiation of the VLL encapsulation mode, and is used only on local side."
