    "ExtraInfo": "In MPLS L2VPN scenarios, PEs and CEs do not advertise their active/standby status and link status to each other. PW OAM and AC OAM need to be configured to monitor PW and AC status respectively. OAM mapping is enabled on the PEs to associate PW OAM with AC OAM.\nThe mpls l2vpn oam-mapping command can be used on a low-speed interface only when VLL or PWE3 has been configured on the interface.\nAfter the mpls l2vpn oam-mapping command is configured on a PE, AC status will be associated with PW status. If a fault occurs on an AC, the local PE will notify the remote PE of the AC fault. If a fault occurs on a PW, the local PE will notify the local CE of the fault. Timely fault notification allows PEs and CEs to coordinate with each other in end-to-end FRR."
