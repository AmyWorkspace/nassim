    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEstablishing a remote LDP session between two PEs is the prerequisite for establishing an LDP VPLS or VPWS PW between the two PEs. Usually, the mpls ldp remote-peer command is used to establish a remote LDP session. If a PE has to establish multiple LDP VPLS or VPWS PWs with other PEs, the mpls ldp remote-peer command has to be run multiple times. To simplify LDP VPLS or VPWS PW establishment, run the mpls l2vpn auto-create-session command. Then, a remote LDP session will be automatically established during LDP VPLS or VPWS establishment.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS L2VPN has been enabled using the mpls l2vpn command.\nPrecautions\nAfter the undo mpls l2vpn auto-create-session command is run, the system will delete all automatically established remote LDP sessions, causing related PWs to go Down. Exercise caution when running this command.If a remote LDP session has been established using the mpls ldp remote-peer remote-peer-name command, another remote LDP session with the same name as this remote LDP session cannot be established after the mpls l2vpn auto-create-session command is run."
