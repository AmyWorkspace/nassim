    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nThe active and standby PWs are determined by means of negotiation. Two PWs are configured on one PE to connect to two peer PEs, with both PWs being in the master state on the local device. The peer PEs determine the master and backup PWs by means of mVRRP, with one PW in the master state and the other in the backup state. The PEs on both ends negotiate and finally determine the active PW.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA service PW has been created using the mpls l2vc command.\n\nPrecautions\n\nA service PW can be bound only to one mVRRP group.\nThe service PW and mVRRP group must be configured on different sub-interfaces of the same physical interface. Otherwise, the status of the mVRRP group cannot reflect the actual status of the service PW."
