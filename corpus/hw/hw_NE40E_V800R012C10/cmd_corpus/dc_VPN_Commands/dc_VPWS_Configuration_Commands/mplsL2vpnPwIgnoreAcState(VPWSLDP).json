    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the reliability scenario where an LDP VC is configured to protect a CCC VC, when an AC interface goes Down, the PW status also goes Down. When the AC interface goes Up, the PW has to negotiate the status and reestablish a connection. At this time, if an active/standby PW switchover is being performed, traffic is switched back to the active PW only after the PW negotiation is complete. As a result, the switchback performance deteriorates. To improve the switchback performance, run the mpls l2vpn pw ignore-ac-state command. With this configuration, when an AC interface goes Down, its connected PW remains Up; when the AC interface goes Up, the PW does not have to reestablish a connection.\nPrerequisites\nA PW has been configured on an interface."
