If you configure an LDP VPWS based on a PW template with the MTU configured using the mtu command, the MTU will be used for PW negotiation.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS L2VPN has been enabled.A PW template has been created.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\nApply an existing PW template that has been configured when configuring an LDP VPWS connection on an interface.\nPrecautions\nWhen configuring MTUs, ensure that the MTUs of the PE interfaces on the two ends of a PW are the same. During the configuration of LDP VPWS, if the MTU is configured in both the AC interface view and PW template view, the MTU configured in the AC interface view prevails."
