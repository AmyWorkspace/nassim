    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn TDM transmission of CEP services, bandwidth is occupied no matter whether there is service data. If no service data is transmitted or only data with alarm indications (data with alarm indications is considered invalid data) is transmitted, bandwidth is wasted. To increase bandwidth utilization, run the payload-compression dba command to compress invalid data into DBA packets for transmission and dynamic bandwidth allocation.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the reset pw command to allow attributes in the PW template to take effect on the PW.\nPrecautions\nThe mpls static-l2vc or mpls l2vc command can also be used to configure payload compression DBA if payload-compression dba uneq is configured in the command. If the mpls static-l2vc or mpls l2vc command and the payload-compression dba command are run to configure payload compression DBA, the mpls static-l2vc or mpls l2vc command takes precedence over the payload-compression dba command."
