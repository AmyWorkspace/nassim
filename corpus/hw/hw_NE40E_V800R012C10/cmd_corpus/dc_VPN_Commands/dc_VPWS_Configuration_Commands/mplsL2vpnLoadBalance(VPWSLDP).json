    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIn LDP or SVC VPWS scenarios in which PW services are carried over multiple tunnels, VPWS load balancing can be implemented to fully utilize network bandwidths and improve transmission efficiency. Two VPWS load balancing modes are available:\n\nPer-flow load balancing: Packets from the same source and with the same destination are forwarded over the same tunnel.\nPer-packet load balancing: Packets are forwarded in sequence over alternate tunnels used for load balancing.\n\nBy default, per-flow load balancing is used for LDP and SVC VPWS. After the mpls l2vpn load-balance packet command is configured, per-packet load balancing is performed for packets transmitted on the LDP or SVC VPWS network. This configuration enables packets to be forwarded on more tunnels than before.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nLDP or SVC VPWS has been configured on the interface, and a tunnel policy has been configured and applied to L2VPN instances.\n\nPrecautions\n\n\nThe mpls l2vpn load-balance packet command applies only to interfaces that have LDP or SVC VPWS configured.\nIf VPWS FRR has been configured on an interface, the mpls l2vpn load-balance packet command configuration takes effect for both the primary and secondary PWs."
