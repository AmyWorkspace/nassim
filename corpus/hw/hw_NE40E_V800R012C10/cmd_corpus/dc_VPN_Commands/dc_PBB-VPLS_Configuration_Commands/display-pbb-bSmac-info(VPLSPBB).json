    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn PBB VPLS, PEs and SPEs on the backbone network need to learn only the virtual B-MAC addresses (including B-SMAC and B-DMAC addresses), which reduces the number of MAC addresses learned and enhances network performance. To check VSIs where B-SMAC addresses are configured, run the display pbb backbone-source-mac command.\nPrecautions\nIf the pbb backbone-source-mac command has not been run to configure B-SMAC addresses, the display pbb backbone-source-mac command output will be blank."
