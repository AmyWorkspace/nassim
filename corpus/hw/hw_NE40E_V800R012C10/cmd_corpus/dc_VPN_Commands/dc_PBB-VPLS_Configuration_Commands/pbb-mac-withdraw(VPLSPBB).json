    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn PBB VPLS, VSIs dynamically learn user MAC and B-MAC addresses to guide traffic forwarding. To prevent traffic loss caused by delayed MAC entry refreshing when an AC interface, I-VSI PW, or B-VSI PW fails, configure PBB VPLS MAC Withdraw.\nPBB VPLS MAC Withdraw is implemented by sending MAC Withdraw messages. MAC Withdraw messages are sent by I-VSIs and B-VSIs. The messages sent by a B-VSI are used to clear the B-MAC addresses learned by other B-VSIs. By default, the MAC Withdraw messages sent by a B-VSI carry a vendor-specific TLV. To enable a B-VSI to send MAC Withdraw messages that carry the 0x406 TLV, run the pbb mac-withdraw mac-opt-compatible command. Two devices can communicate only if they use the same TLV in MAC Withdraw messages.\nPrerequisites\nA B-VSI has been enabled using the pbb b-vsi enable command."
