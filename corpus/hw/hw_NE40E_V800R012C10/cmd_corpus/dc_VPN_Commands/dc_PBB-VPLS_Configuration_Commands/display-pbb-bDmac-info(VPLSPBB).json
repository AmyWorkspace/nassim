    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn PBB VPLS, PEs and SPEs on the backbone network need to learn only the virtual B-MAC addresses (including B-SMAC and B-DMAC addresses), which reduces the number of MAC addresses learned and enhances network performance. To check information about VSIs where B-DMAC addresses are configured, run the display pbb backbone-destination-mac command.\nPrecautions\nIf the pbb backbone-destination-mac command has not been run to configure B-DMAC addresses, the display pbb backbone-destination-mac command output will be blank."
