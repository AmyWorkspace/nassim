    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter enabling an I-VSI, perform the following configurations for the I-VSI to take effect:\nRun the pbb service-type p2p command to configure the PBB VPLS service type.Run the pbb i-tag command to configure the I-tag.Run the pbb backbone-source-mac command to configure the B-SMAC address.Run the pbb backbone-destination-mac command to configure the B-DMAC address.\n\nPrerequisites\nAn I-VSI has been enabled using the pbb i-vsi enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf an I-VSI is bound to a B-VSI, you must remove the binding before running the undo pbb service-type command.\nPrecautions\nThe service type can be configured only in I-VSIs and can only be P2P in PBB VPLS currently. This means that an I-VSI can be bound only to one AC interface. If m CEs connecting to a local PE need to communicate with m CEs connecting to n peer PEs, m x n I-VSIs must be enabled."
