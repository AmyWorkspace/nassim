For PWs using the other signaling type, the hard pipe configuration is not supported, and no hard pipe traffic statistics are displayed.\nTo monitor hard pipe traffic statistics continuously within a certain period, run the display traffic-statistics vsi hard-pipe command. After this configuration is performed, hard pipe traffic statistics are displayed at a specified interval for a specified number of times."
