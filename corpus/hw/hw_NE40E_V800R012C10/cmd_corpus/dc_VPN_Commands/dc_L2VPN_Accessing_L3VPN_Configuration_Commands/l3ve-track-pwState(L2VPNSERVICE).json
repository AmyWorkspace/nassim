    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the IP RAN mixed VPN solution, if the primary and secondary PWs have been established and corresponding L3VE interfaces have gone Up after the primary RSG recovers, the downstream traffic may switch back to the primary RSG. However, if the downstream traffic switches back to the primary RSG before the primary/secondary PW switchover is complete, the downstream traffic may be temporarily dropped. To solve this problem, run the l3ve trackpw-state command to associate the L3VE interface status with the PW status.The l3ve trackpw-state command associates the L3VE interface status with the PW status. Then, the L3VE interface can keep its status consistent with the PW status by detecting the active and standby status of the PW, so that the traffic on the RNC can be properly switched between the master and backup RSGs.\nPrecautions\nThis command can be configured only on the VE sub-interface."
