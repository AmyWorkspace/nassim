Cookies are used in security checks performed at the endpoints of a tunnel to prevent network spoofing and attacks. The local and remote cookie values must be the same. Otherwise, services are interrupted.\nPrerequisites\nL2TPv3 has been enabled using the l2tpv3 enable command.\nAn L2TPv3 tunnel has been configured using the l2tpv3 pw command.\nPrecautions\nWhen changing cookie values, you must change the local cookie value before changing the remote cookie value. Otherwise, services are interrupted.\nTunnel authentication helps ensure tunnel security. Determine whether to configure tunnel authentication based on actual requirements when creating a tunnel."
