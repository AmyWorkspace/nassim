    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf all is specified, all blocked interfaces are displayed. These interfaces are not listed in sequence.\nPrecautions\nWhen you check all blocked interfaces on the slave main control board, the loop detection information on the Eth-trunk sub-interface is saved on the main control board, and the loop detection information on the physical sub-interface is saved on the interface board. Therefore, you need to pay attention to the following when running the display loop-detect block all slave command:\nIn the case of dual MPUs, you can only view the blocking status of the Eth-trunk sub-interface on the slave main control board.In the NPU1:1 environment, you can only view the blocking status of physical sub-interfaces on the slave main control board."
