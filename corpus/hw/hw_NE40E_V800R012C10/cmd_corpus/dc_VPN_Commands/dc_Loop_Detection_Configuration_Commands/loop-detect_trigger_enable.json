    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable or disable the proactive loop detection upon interface Up function globally, run the loop-detect trigger enable command.\nAfter this function is enabled, loop detection is triggered when an interface is bound to a VSI or a physical interface changes from Down to Up. If a loop is detected on a sub-interface of the physical interface, this physical interface is blocked.\nYou can run the reset loop-detect trigger trigger-down command or run the shutdown and undo shutdown commands in sequence to unblock the interface.\nPrecautions\nProactive loop detection fails to take effect on interfaces that have STP, local loopback, loop detection, or loopback detection enabled.\nIt is recommended that you disable this function on properly running devices. If you have to use this function to detect whether links operate properly during site deployment, be sure to disable this function after this stage."
