    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a VPLS network, after an AC sub-interface or interface has loop detection enabled using the loop-detect enable command, if the access link or device fails, the devices bound to the same VSI cannot immediately detect this failure and therefore cannot promptly update their MAC address entries. To resolve this problem, run the loop-detect mac-withdraw enable command on the AC sub-interface or interface to enable it to delete MAC address entries when its loop detection status changes.\nThe loop-detect mac-withdraw enable command speeds up traffic switching.\nPrerequisites\nLoop detection has been enabled using the loop-detect enable command.The sub-interface or the interface has been bound to a VSI using the l2 binding command."
