    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn VPLS multi-homing scenarios where a CE is single-homed to a PE, after the pwsignal bgp multi-homing command is run, the system automatically generates a default multi-homing site for the single-homed PE. After the default multi-homing site is generated, run the site default command to enter the default VSI-BGP-SITE view.\nPrerequisites\nVPLS multi-homing has been enabled using the pwsignal bgp multi-homing command.An RD has been configured for the VSI using the route-distinguisher (VSI-BGP view) command.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the site-id site-id command to configure a multi-homing site ID.\nPrecautions\nThe site default command applies only to VPLS multi-homing scenarios where a CE is single-homed to a PE.\nThe active delay-time, and recover delay-time commands used for configuring link protection between the CE and PE cannot be used.Because only one multi-homing site exists, the best-site command cannot be used."
