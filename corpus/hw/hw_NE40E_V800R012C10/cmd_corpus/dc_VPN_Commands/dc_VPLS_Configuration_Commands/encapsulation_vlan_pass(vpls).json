    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an Ethernet virtual connection (EVC) scenario, when a bridge domain (BD) accesses a VPLS service in VSI exclusive service mode, the pseudo wire (PW) works in raw mode (the VSI encapsulation type is VLAN). Packets are directly forwarded without having the outer tag removed when they leave a PW. After the encapsulation vlan pass command is run, the raw mode is switched to the tagged mode so that the outer VLAN tag can be removed from the packets before the packets are forwarded out of a PW."
