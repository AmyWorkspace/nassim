    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFigure 1 shows the association between spoke PW and hub PW in the configuration guide, the UPE connects to SPE1 over PW1, a primary PW, and connects to SPE2 over PW2, a secondary PW. PW1 and PW2 work in backup mode. SPEs and NPEs are connected using hub PWs.\nUnder normal circumstances, if all hub PWs connected to SPE1 go Down but PW1 is Up, the upstream traffic still travels along the primary PW, PW1. As a result, traffic gets lost. To prevent traffic loss, run the track hub-pw command on SPE1 to associate the spoke PW status with the hub PW status. After the track hub-pw command is run, SPE1 instructs the UPE to switch traffic to the secondary spoke PW after detecting that all connected hub PWs go Down."
