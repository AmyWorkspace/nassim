    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nAfter a VSI is created and configured, you must run the l2 binding command on an AC interface to bind the AC interface to the VSI.\nIn VPLS multi-homing scenarios, after a multi-homing site is configured, run the l2 binding vsi multi-homing-site command to bind the multi-homing site to an AC interface. This configuration allows PEs to determine the master/backup status of the AC interfaces based on the bound multi-homing sites so that the backup AC interface can be blocked and traffic is forwarded only through the preferred AC interface.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA VSI has been created and configured. For example, the VSI ID and peer IP address have been configured.\nA multi-homing site ID has been configured using the site-id site-id command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAfter an interface is bound to a VSI, the interface can no longer be configured with Layer 3 services, such as the IP address. The VPWS or L3VPN cannot be configured either.\nAfter multi-homing sites are bound to AC interfaces, the PE calculates the master/backup status of the AC interfaces again based on the bound multi-homing sites. If the calculation result changes, the PE instructs the remote PE on the PW to converge routes.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\n\nAfter an interface is bound to a VSI, you can run the display vsi command to view whether the VSI status is Up, according to which you can find whether the PW is set up successfully for the VSI.\n\nPrecautions\n\nVPLS multi-homing blocks data packets on the backup PE's AC interface to prevent loops. There is no need to deploy additional loop prevention protocols such as STP or MAC Flapping. When STP or MAC Flapping is deployed, the backup PE does not block Layer 2 protocol packets on its AC interface. The AC interfaces of the master and backup PEs may both be blocked, interrupting traffic.\n\n\nThe local VSI in P2P mode does not support the AC interface that is a QinQ or dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interface, QinQ stacking, QinQ mapping, or flexible sub-interface, or a VE interface.\n\n\nThe CE interfaces connected to the AC interfaces on two ends cannot be allocated the same IP address.\n\n\nVXLAN is mutually exclusive with VPLS. Specifically, the l2 binding command cannot be run on an AC interface that has the VXLAN configuration.\n\n\nIf any of the user-queue, qos-profile, or car commands is run on an interface, the l2 binding command cannot be run to bind a VSI with hard pipe enabled to the interface. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.\n\n\nIf qos hard-pipe bandwidth command is run on an interface, the l2 binding command cannot be run to bind a VSI with hard pipe enabled to the interface. Otherwise, an error message is displayed."
