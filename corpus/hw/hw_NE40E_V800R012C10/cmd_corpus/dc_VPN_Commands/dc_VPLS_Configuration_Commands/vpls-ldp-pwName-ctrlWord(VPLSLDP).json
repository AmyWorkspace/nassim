    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn load balancing mode, packets may arrive out of order. In this case, you can add the control word to packets for sequence identification.\nIf two PEs connect to each other over an Ethernet link and CEs connect to PEs over PPP links, PPP negotiation may fail if the size of PPP control packets does not meet the minimum MTU requirements of the Ethernet. In this case, you can add the control word as padding bits to PPP control packets.\nPrerequisites\nA VSI and the corresponding VPLS PW have been configured."
