    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMulticast fast switch can fast switch VSI multicast traffic from a faulty primary TE tunnel to a backup tunnel. Multicast fast switch can be enabled in VPLS over TE scenarios in which the public network tunnels of a VSI are TE tunnels and the VSI forwards multicast traffic.\nThe command for configuring multicast fast switch in a VPLS over TE scenario supports switching between the TE tunnel and FRR bypass tunnel, switching between the TE tunnel and HSB tunnel, and switching between TE tunnels.\nPrecautions\nIn PBB VPLS scenarios, this command can be configured in both the I-VSI view and B-VSI view.\nIf the VSI is already in the Up state, after the command for multicast traffic fast switch in the VPLS over TE scenario is configured, you need to restart the VSI to validate the configuration."
