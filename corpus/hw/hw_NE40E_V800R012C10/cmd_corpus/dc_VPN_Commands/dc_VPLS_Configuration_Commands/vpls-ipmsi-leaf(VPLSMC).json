    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a multicast VPLS network, a P2MP tunnel can have multiple leaf nodes but only one root node. To specify a leaf node and enter the VSI-Inclusive-Leaf view so that you can configure the leaf node, run the leaf command.\nPrerequisites\nThe VSI-Inclusive view has been created and has been displayed using the inclusive-provider-tunnel command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the primary-root backup-root command to specify the primary and backup P2MP tunnels in dual-root protection scenarios in which P2MP tunnels are configured.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo leaf command deletes a leaf node and all configurations of the leaf node. Exercise caution when running the undo leaf command."
