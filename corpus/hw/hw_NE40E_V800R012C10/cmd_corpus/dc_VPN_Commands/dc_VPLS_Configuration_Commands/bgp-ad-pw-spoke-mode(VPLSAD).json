    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a BGP AD VPLS needs to be deployed on a network with a star or tree topology (on which one PE that serves as a server or an authorization device is configured as the Hub-PE, and other PEs are configured as Spoke-PEs) the PWs of the VSI on the Hub-PE must be configured as spoke PEs to disable split horizon of the PWs.\nPrerequisites\nThe vpls-id command has been run in the VSI-BGPAD view to specify a VPLS ID.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the pw spoke-mode command is run, all PWs of the specified VSI become spoke PWs. Split horizon does not function on spoke PWs. This means that packets sent from spoke PWs can be forwarded to other PWs. If the undo pw spoke-mode command is run, all PWs of the VSI will be changed to hub PWs that abide by split horizon rules.\nPrecautions\nThe pw spoke-mode command takes effect on all the PWs of a BGP AD VSI."
