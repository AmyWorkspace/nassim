    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn VPLS multi-homing scenarios, a PE accessed by CEs considers each CE a site. To differentiate sites, run the site-id command to configure a multi-homing site ID. The local PE then uses BGP signaling to send the site ID to the other PEs so that these PEs can determine whether they have the same site as the local PE.\nPrerequisites\nA multi-homing site has been created and the VSI-BGP-SITE view is displayed using the site name site-name command.\nPrecautions\nThe IDs of the multi-homing sites for the same accessed CE must be the same. Otherwise, multi-homing cannot be implemented.The site IDs in the same VSI on the same PE must be different. The local site ID must be smaller than the remote one plus remote default-offset, but greater than or equal to the remote default-offset."
