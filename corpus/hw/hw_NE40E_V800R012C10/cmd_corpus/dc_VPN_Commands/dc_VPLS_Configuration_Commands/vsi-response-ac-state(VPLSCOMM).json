    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a VPLS over EVC scenario, each BD functions as an access-side service instance and EVC Layer 2 sub-interfaces join each BD as AC interfaces. The BD status is determined by the status of EVC Layer 2 sub-interfaces in the BD as well as that of the VSI. A BD goes Down only when the status of all EVC Layer 2 sub-interfaces in the BD as well as that of the VSI are both Down. The EVC Layer 2 sub-interface status is independent of the VSI status.\nIn a VPWS accessing VPLS scenario where a VSI VC is configured on the local end and a VPWS VC is configured on the remote end, if all EVC Layer 2 sub-interfaces in the BD are Down, the remote VPWS VC cannot quickly detect the fault. As a result, traffic is interrupted. To solve this problem, run the response-ac-state command, so that the VSI can learn the AC interface Down event immediately after all EVC Layer 2 sub-interfaces in the BD go Down. Then, the VSI will set the PW status to Down.\nPrecautions\nThe response-ac-state command applies only to LDP VPLS over EVC, BGP VPLS over EVC, and BGP AD VPLS over EVC scenarios."
