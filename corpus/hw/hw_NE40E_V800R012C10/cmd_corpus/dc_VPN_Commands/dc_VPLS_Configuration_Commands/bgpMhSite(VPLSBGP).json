    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn VPLS multi-homing scenarios, a PE accessed by CEs considers each CE a site. If a PE is accessed by multiple CEs, you must configure a multi-homing site for each CE. To create a multi-homing site, run the site name command.\nPrerequisites\nAn RD has been configured for the VSI using the route-distinguisher (VSI-BGP view) command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the site-id site-id command to configure a multi-homing site ID.\nPrecautions\nWhen you run the undo site name command to delete a multi-homing site that has been created, all configurations of the multi-homing site will be deleted. Exercise caution when running this command."
