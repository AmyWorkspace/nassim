    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn VPLS multi-homing scenarios, if networks are unstable, AC interfaces may frequently flap, causing frequent PW switching. To prevent this problem, run the active delay-time command to configure a time period during which an AC interface remains in the blocked state. Before delay-time elapses, the AC interface remains in the Down state. After delay-time elapses, the AC interface goes Up. This reduces PW switching frequency.\nPrerequisites\nA multi-homing site ID has been configured using the site-id site-id command."
