    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo change the attribute of an AC interface of a VSI from spoke to hub, run the hub-mode enable command on a PE. In this way, traffic can be isolated between AC interfaces working in hub mode.\nAfter the isolate spoken command is run, all AC interfaces in a VSI are isolated from each other. If some AC interfaces in the same VSI need to communicate, run the hub-mode enable command to isolate traffic on demand.\nPrerequisites\nA VSI has been created and bound to an interface.\nPrecautions\nIf the hub-mode enable command is run on two local AC interfaces, the two local AC interfaces cannot communicate and can communicate with other ACs where the hub-mode enable command is not run."
