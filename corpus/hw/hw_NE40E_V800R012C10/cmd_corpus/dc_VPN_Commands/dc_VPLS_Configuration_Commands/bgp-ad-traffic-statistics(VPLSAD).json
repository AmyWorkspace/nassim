    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter BGP AD VPLS configurations are complete, the traffic-statistics enable command can be run to collect statistics about traffic on the PWs of a VSI in a BGP AD VPLS domain. The command output will help you learn about the PW traffic of a VSI and monitor the network operating status.\nPrerequisites\nA VPLS ID has been specified in the VSI-BGPAD view.\nPrecautions\nIf the traffic-statistics enable and traffic-statistics peer commands are both run in the VSI-BGP AD view, configuration of the traffic-statistics peer command takes effect on the peer."
