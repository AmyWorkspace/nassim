    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf users using the same services are bound to the same VSI, you can use the isolate spoken command to prevent the users from communicating with each other. When using the\nisolate spoken command, note the following:\nFor ordinary VPLS, communications between AC interfaces are prohibited.For HVPLS, communications between AC interfaces, between AC interfaces and UPE PWs, and between UPE PWs are prohibited.\n\nPrerequisites\nA signaling protocol has been configured for the VSI instance."
