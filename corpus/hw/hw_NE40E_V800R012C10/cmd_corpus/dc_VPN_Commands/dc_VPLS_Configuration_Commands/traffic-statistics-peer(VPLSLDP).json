    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the VSI-LDP view, you can enable or disable the function to collect statistics about the public traffic of the LDP VPLS PW. The PW is uniquely identified by the VSI name, the next-hop IP address, and the peer PW ID.\nNote that:\nThe traffic-statistics peer peer-address [ negotiation-vc-id vc-id ] enable command enables the function to collect statistics about the public traffic on a specific LDP VPLS PW. This command takes precedence over the undo traffic-statistics enable command. After running this command, you can view statistics about the public traffic on a specific LDP VPLS PW no matter whether you have run the undo traffic-statistics enable command to disable the function to collect statistics about the VSI-based global traffic in VSI LDP mode.The traffic-statistics peer peer-address [ negotiation-vc-id vc-id ] disable command disables the function to collect statistics about the public traffic on a specific LDP VPLS PW. This command takes precedence over the traffic-statistics enable command. After running this command, you cannot view statistics about the public traffic on a specific LDP VPLS PW no matter whether you have run the traffic-statistics enable command to enable the function to collect statistics about the VSI-based global traffic in VSI LDP mode.The undo traffic-statistics peer peer-address [ negotiation-vc-id vc-id ] enable command deletes the configuration of the traffic-statistics peer peer-address [ negotiation-vc-id vc-id ] enable command. After this command is run, the function to collect statistics about the public traffic on a specific LDP VPLS PW inherits the status of the function to collect statistics about the VSI-based global traffic in VSI LDP mode. For example, if you have run the traffic-statistics enable command to enable the function to collect statistics about the VSI-based global traffic in VSI LDP mode, the statistics about the public traffic on a specific LDP VPLS PW can be viewed.The undo traffic-statistics peer peer-address [ negotiation-vc-id vc-id ] disable command deletes the configuration of the traffic-statistics peer peer-address [ negotiation-vc-id vc-id ] disable command. After this command is run, the function to collect statistics about the public traffic on a specific LDP VPLS PW inherits the status of the function to collect statistics about the VSI-based global traffic in VSI LDP mode.
