    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a VPLS over EVC scenario, a BD functions as the access-side service instance, and a Layer 2 EVC sub-interface functions as an AC interface to join the BD. A BD goes Down after all EVC Layer 2 sub-interfaces leave the BD. By default, a PE sends MAC Withdraw messages with the 0x404 TLV type to all peers when a BD goes Down. After the interface-status-change mac-withdraw enable command is run, a PE sends MAC Withdraw messages with the 0x406 TLV type to all peers each time an EVC Layer 2 sub-interface leaves the BD, affecting the PE performance. To solve this problem, run the mac-withdraw bd-status down disable command to disable a PE from sending MAC Withdraw messages with the 0x404 TLV type to all peers when a BD goes Down."
