    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an IP RAN scenario, the VRRP instance is adopted to determine whether an aggregation site gateway (ASG) is the master or backup and control the master/backup switchover. The mVSI created on the ASG is dedicated to transmitting master/backup detection packets between ASGs.\nPrecautions\nYou cannot run the shutdown command on the mVSI.\nCompared with the service VSI, the mVSI becomes Up on different conditions as follows:\nmVSI: requires an Up PW or an Up AC in the VSI.Service VSI: requires two or more Up AC interfaces, or an Up AC interface and an Up PW.\nWhen the mVSI receives a gratuitous ARP packet, it checks whether the link over which the packet is transmitted changes. If the link over which the packet is transmitted changes, the mVSI clears all the MAC addresses of service VSIs associated with the mVSI. If the link over which the packet is transmitted remains unchanged, the mVSI does not clear the MAC addresses of service VSIs associated with the mVSI."
