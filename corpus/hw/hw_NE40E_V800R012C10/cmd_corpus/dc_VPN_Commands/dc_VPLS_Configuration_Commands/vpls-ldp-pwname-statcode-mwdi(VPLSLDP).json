    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen VPWS PWs in redundancy mode are connected to a VPLS, if the primary PW becomes the secondary PW, this PW sends the status code of 20 to the VPLS network. By default, a VPLS PW clears local MAC addresses when it receives the remote status code of 20. When a large number of services are running on the VPLS network, clearing local MAC address entries takes a long time, which deteriorates performance. To prevent this, run the status-code-change flush-mac disable command. This configuration prevents the VPLS PW from clearing local MAC address entries when it receives the remote status code of 20.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS L2VPN has been enabled and the L2VPN view has been displayed using the mpls l2vpn command."
