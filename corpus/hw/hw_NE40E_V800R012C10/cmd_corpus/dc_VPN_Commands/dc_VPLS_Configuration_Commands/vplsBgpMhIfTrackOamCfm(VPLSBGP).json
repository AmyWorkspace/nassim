    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIn VPLS multi-homing scenarios, CFM is generally deployed between a CE and a PE. If the PE's AC interface is blocked, the CE cannot detect the blocked state and continues sending traffic to the PE, causing a waste of forwarding resources. To associate CFM with the AC interface's blocked state, run the mpls l2vpn multi-homing trigger cfm command on the PE. If the PE's AC interface is blocked, it sends CCMs carrying the blocked state to the CE. Upon receipt, the CE with the cfm md md-name ma ma-name trigger clear-arp command will clear the ARP entries learned from the PE, saving forwarding resources.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nA multi-homing site has been bound to an AC interface using the l2 binding vsi multi-homing-site command.\nBasic CFM functions have been configured.\n\n\nPrecautions\n\nIn VPLS multi-homing scenarios, CFM applies only to sub-interfaces. Therefore, you must run the mpls l2vpn multi-homing trigger cfm command on sub-interfaces."
