    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn dual-root protection scenarios where mLDP P2MP tunnels are used to carry services, the working and protection root nodes both send traffic. The leaf nodes receive and process traffic from both the primary mLDP P2MP tunnel and the backup mLDP P2MP tunnel. To enable leaf nodes to receive and process traffic from only the primary mLDP P2MP tunnel, run the vpls p2mp group-select ldp enable command.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS L2VPN has been enabled using the mpls l2vpn command."
