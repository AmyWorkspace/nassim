    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a dual-homing VPLS or HVPLS network, MAC withdraw messages can be forwarded between hub and spoke PWs and between spoke PWs. Incorrect configurations may cause a MAC withdraw message loop, which results in traffic loss. If the loop involves a large number of MAC withdraw messages, denial of service (DoS) attacks may occur. To resolve these problems, run the vpls mac-withdraw loop-detect enable command to enable MAC withdraw loop detection. After you enable MAC withdraw loop detection, a PE immediately discards MAC withdraw messages when it detects a MAC withdraw message loop.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS L2VPN has been enabled using the mpls l2vpn command."
