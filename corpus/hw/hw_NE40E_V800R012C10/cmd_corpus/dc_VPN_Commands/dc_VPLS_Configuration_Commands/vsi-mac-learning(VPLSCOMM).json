    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter MAC address learning is disabled, a VPLS network can simulate a VPWS network. If there are two PEs and only one CE connects to each PE, you can disable MAC address learning on the PEs to reduce the burden of MAC address learning on the PEs.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the mac-learning disable command is run, the device can no longer automatically learn MAC addresses, causing packets to be broadcast on the network. Exercise caution when using this command."
