    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe loop-detect priority command can be configured on an interface only after loop detection is enabled globally and the loop-detect enable command is configured on the VPLS AC interface.\nThe smaller the value, the higher the blocking priority of an interface. When a loop occurs, the interface with the highest blocking priority is preferentially blocked. If you do not configure the loop-detect priority command, the value is 0 by default."
