    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn the HUAWEI, MAC address learning in multi-channel load balancing or FRR scenarios is different from that in single path scenarios in that NHP information must be learned in the former scenarios. In this case, if a link fault occurs in LDP LSP multi-channel load balancing or LDP FRR scenarios, the PW-side MAC address entries learned by the user network are deleted due to the learning mode change, and re-learning is triggered. To prevent the MAC addresses from being deleted, enable VPLS LDP fast switching, which helps accelerate the known unicast traffic convergence and minimize packet loss."
