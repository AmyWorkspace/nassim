    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a link protection scenario, if both the primary and secondary PWs go faulty, the service VSI PW and the protocol VSI PW also go faulty. When the fault is rectified, the service VSI PW may go Up before the protocol VSI PW. This results in a service VSI loop and adversely affects service traffic.\nTo solve this problem, run the monitor-group command to create an L2VPN monitoring group, bind the protocol VSI PW to the monitoring group, and specify the monitoring group to be tracked in the service VSI. When the protocol VSI PW bound to the monitoring group goes Up, the device blocks the service VSI PW by changing its status to not forwarding and starts the hold-off timer. After the timer expires, the service PW is unblocked. This ensures that service VSI loops do not occur in such a scenario.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of 512 L2VPN monitoring groups can be created."
