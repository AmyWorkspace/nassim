These statistics help you learn network operating status.\nPrerequisites\nVPLS multi-homing has been enabled using the pwsignal bgp multi-homing command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display traffic-statistics vsi vsi [ peer peer-address ] command to check traffic statistics about a PW.Before running the traffic-statistics peer command, run the reset traffic-statistics vsi vsi-name [ peer peer-address ] command to clear VPLS PW traffic statistics."
