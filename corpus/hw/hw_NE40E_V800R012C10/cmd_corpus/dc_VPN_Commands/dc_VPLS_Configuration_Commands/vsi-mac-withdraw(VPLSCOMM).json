    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an LDP VPLS network, VSIs depend on MAC address entries to transmit traffic. If the AC or PW status changes, VSIs need to update the MAC entries immediately to reduce the traffic loss. The mac-withdraw enable command enables a PE to send a MAC Withdraw message to all its remote peers to inform them of the AC or PW status change (if any). After the peers receive the message, they remove the MAC address entries in their VSIs based on the message.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the MAC withdraw function is enabled, the MAC addresses learned from the remote end may be deleted from the local end when the AC or PW turns Up or Down and broadcast may be triggered.\nPrecautions\nThis command takes effect only after the interface-status-change mac-withdraw enable command is also used."
