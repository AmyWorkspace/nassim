After service VSI PWs are configured to track an L2VPN monitoring group, if the protocol VSI PWs bound to the L2VPN monitoring group all go Up, the maximum hold-off timer for unblocking the service VSI PWs is started. After the maximum hold-off time elapses, the service VSI PWs are unblocked.\nPrecautions\nService VSI PWs will be unblocked under either of the following conditions:\nThe protocol VSI PWs bound to an L2VPN monitoring group all go Up, and the hold-off time for unblocking the service VSI PWs expires.The protocol VSI PWs bound to an L2VPN monitoring group remain Down, but the maximum hold-off time for unblocking the service VSI PWs expires."
