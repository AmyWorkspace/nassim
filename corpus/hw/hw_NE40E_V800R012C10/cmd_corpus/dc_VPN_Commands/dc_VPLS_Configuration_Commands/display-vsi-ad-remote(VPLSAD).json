An AS number ranges from 0 to 65535, and a user-defined number ranges from 0 to 4294967295. The AS number and user-defined number cannot be both 0s. That is, a VPLS ID cannot be 0:0.32-bit AS number:16-bit user-defined number: for example, 100.5:1. The 32-bit AS number is usually in the format of x.y. The values of x and y range from 0 to 65535. The AS number and user-defined number cannot be both 0s. That is, a VPLS ID cannot be 0.0:0.Integral 4-byte AS number:2-byte user-defined number, for example, 65537:3.
