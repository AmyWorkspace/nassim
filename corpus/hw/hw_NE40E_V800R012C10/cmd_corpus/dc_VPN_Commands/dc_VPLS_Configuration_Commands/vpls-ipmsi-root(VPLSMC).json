    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a multicast VPLS network, the root node is the ingress of a P2MP MPLS tunnel. A P2MP tunnel can have only one root node but can have multiple leaf nodes. To specify the root node and enter the VSI-Inclusive-Root view so that you can configure on the leaf node, run the root command.\nPrerequisites\nThe VSI-Inclusive view has been created and has been displayed using the inclusive-provider-tunnel command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nP2MP tunnels are classified as mLDP P2MP tunnels or P2MP TE tunnels. After the root node is specified, you can configure an mLDP P2MP tunnel or P2MP TE tunnel.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo root command deletes the root node configuration and all configurations in the VSI-Inclusive-Root view."
