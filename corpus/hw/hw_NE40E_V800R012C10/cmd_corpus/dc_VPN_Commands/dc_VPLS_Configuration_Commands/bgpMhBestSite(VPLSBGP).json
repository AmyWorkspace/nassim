    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn VPLS multi-homing scenarios, the system selects a site for PW establishment based on the AC status (ACS), multi-homing site priority (PREF), and PE's router ID (PE-ID). However, the site selected may differ if the ACS, PREF, or PE-ID value changes, causing frequent PW changes. To prevent frequent PW changes, run the best-site command to specify an optimal multi-homing site so that the system will use the optimal site for PW establishment.\nPrerequisites\nA multi-homing site ID has been configured using the site-id command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is mutually exclusive with the active delay-time command and recover delay-time command.A VSI can have only one optimal multi-homing site configured.The PEs at both ends use the optimal sites of each other to establish a PW only after the best-site command is run on both PEs.The PEs that a CE is multi-homed to must have different optimal multi-homing sites configured."
