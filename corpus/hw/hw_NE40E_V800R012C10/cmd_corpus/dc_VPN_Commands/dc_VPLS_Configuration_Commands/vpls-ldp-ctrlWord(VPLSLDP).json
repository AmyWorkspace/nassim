    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nVirtual circuit connectivity verification (VCCV) is a mechanism to detect and diagnose end-to-end faults on PWs. VCCV is, in its simplest description, a control channel between a PW's ingress and egress over which connectivity verification messages can be sent. VCCV can be performed in either label alert mode or control word mode. By default, the control word function is not enabled. To detect the connectivity of a VPLS PW, run the control-word enable command to enable the control word function.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the control-word enable command is configured on a device, the device sets the control word flag in Label Mapping messages. A PW can be successfully negotiated only if the control word function is enabled on both ends of the PW.\nFollow-up Procedure\nPerform a ping operation to detect VPLS PW connectivity.\nPrecautions\nIf the control-word enable command has been run in the VSI-LDP view to enable the control word function for all PWs in a VSI, but a PW does not need the control word function, run the control-word disable command in the VSI-LDP-PW view to disable the control word function for the PW."
