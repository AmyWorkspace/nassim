    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the function of blocking IP addresses in telnet connection scenarios is enabled, the device blocks IP addresses that fail to be authenticated and rejects telnet connect requests that use the blocked IP addresses. The device also records the blocked IP addresses in a list.After the function is disabled, the device deletes the blocked IP addresses from the list and does not record new IP addresses that fail to be authenticated. To disable the function, run the telnet server ip-block disable command.In telnet connection scenarios, IP addresses that fail to be authenticated are blocked only when the function of blocking IP addresses is enabled."
