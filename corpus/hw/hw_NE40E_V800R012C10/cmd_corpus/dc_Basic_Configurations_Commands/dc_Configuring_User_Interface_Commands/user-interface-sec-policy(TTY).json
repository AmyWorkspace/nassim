    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe undo user-interface vty security-policy disable command clears a user authentication request that has been pending for a long time to access the VTY user interface. For example, if the number of existing user authentication requests has already reached the upper limit but a new authentication request is received, the system clears the authentication request of the user that fails to pass the authentication within 15 seconds and starts authenticating the new user.The user-interface vty security-policy disable command cannot clear any user authentication request that has been pending for a long time to access the VTY user interface.It is recommended that you enable the security policy to harden the VTY user interface's security."
