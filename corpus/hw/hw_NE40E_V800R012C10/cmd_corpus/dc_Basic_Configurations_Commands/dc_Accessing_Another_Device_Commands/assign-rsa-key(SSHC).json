    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a device functioning as an SSH client uses the public algorithm for authentication, run the ssh client peer assign command to assign a public key to the SSH server.If the first-time authentication is not enabled on the SSH client, when the SSH client logs in to the SSH server for the first time, the SSH client fails to pass the check on the public key validity and cannot log in to the server.If the public key stored on the SSH client becomes invalid, run the undo ssh client peer assign command to cancel the association between the SSH server and the public key. Then, run the ssh client peer assign command to assign a new public key to the SSH server.You can run the display ssh server-info command to view the binding information on the SSH client."
