    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe client sends a keepalive message to the server, if it does not receive any data for the keepalive interval from the server. The keepalive messages are sent after the expiry of the keepalive interval. The client disconnects the current connection in case of server response failure.\nIf you reset the keepalive interval to zero seconds, the client does not send any keepalive messages to the server.\nThis command takes effect for both IPv4 and IPv6 SSH clients."
