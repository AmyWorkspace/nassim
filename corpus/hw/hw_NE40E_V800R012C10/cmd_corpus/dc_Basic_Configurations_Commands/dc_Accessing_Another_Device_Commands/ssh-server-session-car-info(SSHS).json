    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo adjust the packet channel bandwidth for SSH session CAR on a device, run the whitelist session-car ssh-server command. If the device receives a large number of SSH Server packets, this configuration ensures that the packets that hit the SSH Server whitelist (session CAR) can be sent to SSH Server properly.\nThe PIR must be greater than or equal to the CIR, and the PBS must be greater than or equal to the CBS.\nImplementation Procedure\nIf a session CAR parameter in an SSH whitelist is set to an excessively large or small value, the involved SSH Server neighbor relationships may be disconnected or flap.\nPrecautions\nIn normal cases, you are advised not to change the values of the session CAR parameters in an SSH whitelist. Use the default values of these parameters instead."
