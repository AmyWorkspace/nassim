    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Telnet session CAR function is enabled by default. It isolates packet channels between Telnet Server sessions.\nTo disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car telnet-server disable command. Telnet Server packets received by this device will be sent directly to the CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of Telnet Server packets, packets from different Telnet Server sessions may preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not usually recommended."
