    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSFTP is short for SSH FTP, which is a secure FTP protocol. SFTP is established over SSH and enables remote users to securely log in to a device for file management and transfer. This ensures data transmission security. In addition, the device provides the SFTP client function so that you can log in to a remote SSH server from the device to securely transfer files.\nWhen the SFTP server or its connection to a client fails, the client must detect the fault in time and release the connection. To achieve this goal, before a client logs in to the server through SFTP, configure an interval at which keepalive packets are sent if no data is received and the maximum number of times that the server does not respond. If the client does not receive any data within the specified interval, it sends a keepalive packet to the server. If the maximum number of times that the server does not respond exceeds the specified value, the client tears down the connection.\nPrerequisites\nA VPN instance has been configured using the ip vpn-instance command.\nThe SFTP service has been enabled on the SSH server using the sftp [ ipv4 | ipv6 ] server enable command.\nPrecautions\nIf the SSH server monitors port number 22, you may not specify the port number for SSH login.If command execution fails due to ACLs on the SFTP client or the TCP connection fails, the system prompts an error message indicating that the connection to the server fails.If no source IP address or source interface is specified, the system uses the source IP address or source interface specified in the sftp client-source command.If a source IP address or source interface is specified, the system does not use the source IP address or source interface specified in the sftp client-source command.If a source IP address has been specified and VPN instance name is not specified, the system uses the global VPN if any and the public VPN when no global VPN is available.BW51"
