    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe SSH session CAR function is enabled by default. It isolates packet channels between SSH Server sessions.\nTo disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car ssh-server disable command. SSH Server packets received by this device will be sent directly to the CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of SSH Server packets, packets from different SSH Server sessions may preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not usually recommended."
