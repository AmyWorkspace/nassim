    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDuring client and server authentication, an algorithm list is provided for the client and server to perform SSL algorithm negotiation. To configure a name for the SSL cipher suite bound to an SSL policy, run the binding cipher-suite-customization command. If no SSL cipher suite is bound to an SSL policy, all the available algorithms can be used by default.\nPrerequisites\nRun the ssl cipher-suite-list command, to create an SSL cipher suite and displays the SSL cipher suite customization view.Run the ssl cipher-suite command, to specify encryption algorithms to be supported in an SSL cipher suite bound to an SSL policy.\n\nPrecautions\nAn SSL policy can bind only one SSL cipher suite."
