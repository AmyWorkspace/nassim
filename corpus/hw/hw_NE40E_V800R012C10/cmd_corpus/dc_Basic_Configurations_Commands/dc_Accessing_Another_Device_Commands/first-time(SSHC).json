    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the SSH client first login function is enabled on a device functioning as a client, the STelnet/SFTP client does not check the validity of the SSH server public key when logging in to the SSH server for the first time. After the login, the system automatically allocates the public key and saves it for authentication in next login.\nPrecautions\nWhen an STelnet/SFTP client attempts to log in to an SSH server for the first time, it does not check the validity of the SSH server public key because it has not saved the SSH server public key.\nThis command takes effect for both IPv4 and IPv6 SSH clients."
