    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf one or more devices need to be configured and managed, you do not need to connect each of the devices to a terminal to maintain the devices locally. If you have obtained the IP address of a device, you can log in to the device from a terminal using Telnet to remotely configure the device. This allows you to maintain multiple devices on one terminal, greatly facilitating device management.\nPrerequisites\nThe terminal communicates with the remote device using IP address and the Telnet server is enabled on the remote device.\nProcedure\nDuring a Telnet connection, you can enter CTRL+K to terminate the connection.\nImplementation Procedure\nDuring a Telnet connection, you can enter CTRL+K to terminate the connection.\nConfiguration Impact\nUser logins through Telnet may bring security risks because Telnet does not provide any secure authentication mechanism and data is transmitted using TCP in plain text. Using STelnet is recommended for a network that has high security requirements."
