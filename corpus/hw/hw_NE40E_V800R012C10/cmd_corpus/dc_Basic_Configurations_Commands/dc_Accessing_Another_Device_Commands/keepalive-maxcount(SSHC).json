    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe client sends keepalive messages to the server. If the client does not receive any data within the keepalive interval from the server, the client sends the keepalive message up to the configured maximum number. The client disconnects the current connection in case of server response failure.The client kept on sending the keepalive message to the server up to the configured maximum number. The client disconnects the current connection on failure of server response.The keepalive interval configuration overrides the keepalive maximum number configuration. For example, If the keepalive interval is set to zero seconds (does not send keepalive messages), the keepalive maximum number configuration has no effect.This command takes effect for both IPv4 and IPv6 SSH clients."
