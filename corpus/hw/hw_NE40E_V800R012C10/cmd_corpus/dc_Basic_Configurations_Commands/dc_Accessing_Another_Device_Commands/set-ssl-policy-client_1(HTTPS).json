    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an HTTP client to perform SSL verification on HTTP servers, run the client ssl-verify peer command. After the HTTP client is granted an SSL digital certificate by a server, the client can verify the validity of the server. This prevents the client from accessing invalid servers, enhancing security.\nPrecautions\nThis command takes effect only if the client ssl-policy command has also been run to configure an SSL policy for the client."
