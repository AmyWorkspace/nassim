    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nVerifying a digital certificate and its path validity can avoid invalid digital certificates and improve security.\nPrerequisites\nAn SSL policy has been created using the ssl policy command.\nPrecautions\nBy default, verification on the basic constraint field pathLenConstraint (path length constraint value) is enabled.After the ssl verify certificate-chain minimum-path-length command is run, the length of a digital certificate chain is checked. If the minimum certificate path length requirement is not met, the verification fails. The minimum certificate path length refers to the complete certificate chain length for SSL handshake, including the local digital certificate."
