    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo change the priority of the SSH packets sent by a client, run the ssh client dscp command to change the DSCP value of the packets. A greater DSCP value indicates a higher priority.The priority of this command is higher than that of the set priority dscp dscp-valuehost-packet type dscp command. If a DSCP value is configured using this command, the configured value takes effect. If a DSCP value is configured using the set priority dscp dscp-valuehost-packet type dscp command rather than this command, the value configured using the set priority dscp dscp-valuehost-packet type dscp command takes effect. If no DSCP\nvalue is configured using the preceding commands, the default DSCP value is used.\nWhen you run the undo ssh client dscp command:If value is not specified, the DSCP field is restored to the default value.If value is 48, the DSCP field is restored to the default value.If value is set to a non-48 value, the value must be the same as value in the telnet server dscp command. Otherwise, the command execution fails.\nThe command only takes effect for ipv4 packets."
