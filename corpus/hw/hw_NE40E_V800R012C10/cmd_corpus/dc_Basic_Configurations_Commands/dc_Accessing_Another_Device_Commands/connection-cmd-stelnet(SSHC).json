    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nLogins by using Telnet bring security risks because Telnet does not provide any secure authentication mechanism and data is transmitted by using TCP in plain text. Compared with Telnet, SSH guarantees secure file transfer on a traditional insecure network by authenticating clients and encrypting data in bidirectional mode. The SSH protocol supports STelnet. You can run this command to use STelnet to log in to another device from the current device.STelnet is a secure Telnet service. SSH users can use the STelnet service in the same way as the Telnet service.When the STelnet server or its connection to a client fails, the client must detect the fault in time and release the connection. To achieve this goal, before a client logs in to the server through STelnet, configure an interval at which keepalive packets are sent if no data is received and the maximum number of times that the server does not respond. If the client does not receive any data within the specified interval, it sends a keepalive packet to the server. If the maximum number of times that the server does not respond exceeds the specified value, the client tears down the connection.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe VPN specified by vpn-instance has been configured.\nThe STelnet service has been enabled on the SSH server using the stelnet [ ipv4 | ipv6 ] server enable command.\nPrecautions\nIf the SSH server monitors port number 22, you may not specify the port number for SSH login.A secure algorithm is required to ensure high security. The STelnet client and the gateway NE in a DCN plug-and-play scenario must support the AES128_CTR, AES256_CTR, AES192_CTR, AES128_GCM, or AES256_GCM algorithm.You must run the ssh client first-time enable command on the STelnet client to enable first login for the SSH client.To ensure compatibility after an upgrade, the stelnet command can be run in the system view."
