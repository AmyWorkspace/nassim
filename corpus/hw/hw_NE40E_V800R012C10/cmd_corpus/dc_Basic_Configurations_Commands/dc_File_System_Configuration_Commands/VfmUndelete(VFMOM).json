If the parameter /unreserved is configured in the delete command, the file cannot be restored.\nPrerequisites\nThe file to be restored is saved in the recycle bin.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the file to be restored has the same name as an existing directory, the operation fails. If the file to be restored has the same name as an existing file, the system prompts you whether to overwrite the existing file."
