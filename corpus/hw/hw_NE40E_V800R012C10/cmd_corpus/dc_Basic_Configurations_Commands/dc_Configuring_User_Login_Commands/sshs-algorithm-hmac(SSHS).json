    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure HMAC authentication algorithms on an SSH server, run the ssh server hmac command. The SSH client and server negotiate authentication algorithms for the packets exchanged between them. During negotiation, the client sends its authentication algorithms to the server. After comparing the received authentication algorithms with the local ones on the server, the server selects the first matching authentication algorithm received for packet transmission. If no matching authentication algorithm is found, the negotiation fails.\nPrecautions\nTo ensure high security, you can use the HMAC authentication algorithms such as: sha2_256, sha2_512.\nThis command takes effect for both IPv4 and IPv6 SSH clients."
