    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter this command is run, the process of editing public key ends. Before saving the public key, the system checks the validity of the key. If there are illegal characters in the public key character string configured by the user, the system displays relevant prompt. The public key configured by the user is discarded, so this configuration fails. If the public key configured is valid, it is saved in public key chain table of the client.\nGenerally, in the public key view, only the peer-public-key end command can be used to exit from the public key view, and the quit command cannot be used.If the legal key coding is not input, the key cannot be generated after the peer-public-key end command is used. The system prompts that generating a key fails.If the key is deleted in another window, the system prompts that the key does not exist and returns to the system view directly when you run the peer-public-key end command."
