    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA local key pair is a prerequisite to a successful SSH login. Compared with the RSA algorithm used by the rsa local-key-pair create command, the ECC algorithm shortens the key length, accelerates the encryption, and improves the security. The length of the server key pair and the host key pair can be 256 bits, 384 bits and 521 bits. By default, the length of the key pair is 521 bits.\nPrecautions\nThe generated ECC host key pair is named in the format of device name_Host_ECC, such as HUAWEI_Host_ECC.\nIf no local key pair is configured when you log in to the device through SSH, the system automatically generates a local key pair.\nThe ecc local-key-pair create command is not saved in the configuration file. It only needs to be run once and takes effect even after the device restarts."
