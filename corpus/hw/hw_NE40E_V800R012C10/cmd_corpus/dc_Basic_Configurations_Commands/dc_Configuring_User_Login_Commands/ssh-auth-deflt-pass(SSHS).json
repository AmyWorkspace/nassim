    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen users request to log in to a device using SSH, if no SSH user is created using the ssh user, ssh user authentication-type, and ssh user service-type commands, successful user login depends on whether the ssh authentication-type default password command is run.\nIf the ssh authentication-type default password command is run, users log in through AAA authentication.If the ssh authentication-type default password command is not run, users cannot log in.\nIf an SSH user has been created using the ssh user, ssh user authentication-type, and ssh user service-type commands, authentication of the SSH user depends on whether the ssh user authentication-type command is run. If the ssh user authentication-type command is run, the user is authenticated using the authentication mode specified in this command. If the ssh user authentication-type command is not run, the user cannot log in to the device.\nThis command takes effect for both IPv4 and IPv6 users."
