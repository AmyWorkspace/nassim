    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo change the priority of the Telnet packets sent by a server, run the telnet server dscp command to change the DSCP value of the packets. A greater DSCP value indicates a higher priority.\nThe priority of this command is higher than that of the host-packet type dscp command. If a DSCP value is configured using this command, the configured value takes effect. If a DSCP value is configured using the host-packet type dscp command rather than this command, the value configured using the host-packet type dscp command takes effect. If no DSCP value is configured using the preceding commands, the default DSCP value is used.\nWhen you run the undo telnet server dscp command:If value is not specified, the DSCP field is restored to the default value.If value is 48, the DSCP field is restored to the default value.If value is set to a non-48 value, the value must be the same as value in the telnet server dscp command. Otherwise, the command execution fails.\n\nThe command only takes effect for IPv4 packets.\n\nPrecautions\nTelnet is an insecure protocol. It is recommended that STelnet be used."
