    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set a period after which the system automatically unlocks an IP address of user, run the ftp server ip-block reactive command. A locked IP address of user cannot access the device through FTP. The system automatically unlocks the IP address of user until the unlocking period expires. This improves device security.\nTo manually unlock the IP address of user, run the activate ftp server ip-block ip-address command."
