    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the SSH client supports the Diffie-hellman-group-exchange key of more than 1024 bits, run the ssh server dh-exchange min-len command to set the minimum key length to 2048 bits to improve security.\nPrecautions\nSecurity risks exist if the minimum Diffie-hellman-group-exchange key length is less than 2048 bits. You are advised to set the minimum key length to 2048 bits.\nThis command takes effect for both IPv4 and IPv6 SSH servers."
