    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an SSH session meets one or more of the following criteria, the system re-negotiates a key and uses the new key to establish SSH session connections, improving system security.\nThe number of interaction packets meets the configured key re-negotiation criterion.The accumulated packet data volume meets the configured key re-negotiation criterion.The session duration meets the configured key re-negotiation criterion.This command takes effect for both IPv4 and IPv6 SSH clients.\n\nPrecautions\nA key re-negotiation request is initiated when either the SSH client or server meets the key re-negotiation criteria, and the other party responds.\nThis command applies only to the SSHv2 protocol."
