    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run the command to enable the local port forwarding service for the SSH server to allow the SSH server to establish TCP connections that cannot be established before due to limitations imposed by a firewall. Implementation of firewall restrictions to complete some previously unable to establish TCP connections. To enable the local port forwarding function on the SSH server, run the ssh server tcp forwarding enable command. To disable this function, run the undo ssh server tcp forwarding enable command. The SSH server can receive forwarding request messages from the SSH client and establish a TCP connection (forwarding channel) with a host with a specified IP address and port number to forward data received from the client to the host only after the local port forwarding function is enabled on the SSH server.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of 32 forwarding channels can be established.If a forwarding channel remains idle for 10 minutes, it is disabled."
