    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an SSH server is enabled to lock client IP addresses, locked client IP addresses fail to pass authentication and are displayed in the display ssh server ip-block list command output.If an SSH server is disabled from locking client IP addresses, the display ssh server ip-block list command does not display any client IP address that is locked because of authentication failures.The operation to disable an SSH server from locking client IP addresses poses system risks and is thereby not recommended."
