    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an FTP server is enabled to lock client ipv4 and ipv6 addresses, a client IP address is locked when the number of FTP authentication failures reaches the upper limit in a specific period of time. Client IP addresses being locked fail the authentication and are displayed in the display ftp server ip-block list command output.If an FTP server is disabled from locking client IP addresses, the display ftp server ip-block list command does not display any client IP address that is locked because of authentication failures.IP addresses being locked are unlocked immediately after the FTP server is disabled from locking client IP addresses.You are advised to enable the FTP server to lock client IP addresses to ensure security."
