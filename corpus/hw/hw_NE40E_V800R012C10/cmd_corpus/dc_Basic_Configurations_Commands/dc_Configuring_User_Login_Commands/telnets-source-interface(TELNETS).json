    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve system security, you can run the telnet server-source command to specify a source interface address for the Telnet server. Then only authorized users can log in to the Telnet server.\nIf the telnet server-source -i command is run and the telnet server-source all-interface command is not, the specified interface is used as the source interface.If the telnet server-source all-interface command is run and the telnet server-source -i command is not, any valid interface on the device can be used as the source interface, including any physical interface with an IP address configured and any created logical interface with an IP address configured.If both the telnet server-source -i and telnet server-source all-interface commands are run, the interface specified in the telnet server-source -i command is preferentially used as the source interface of the Telnet server. If the specified source interface fails to be used for login, the system selects an interface from other valid interfaces for login.If no source interface is specified using the telnet server-source command, users cannot log in to the system through Telnet.\n\nPrerequisites\nA loopback interface has been created if you want to specify it as the source interface of a Telnet server using the telnet server-source command. Otherwise, the command cannot be executed.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the source interface is specified, the system only allows Telnet users to log in to the Telnet server through this source interface, and Telnet users logging in through other interfaces are denied. Note that setting this parameter only affects Telnet users that attempt to log in to the Telnet server, and it does not affect Telnet users that have logged in to the server.\nPrecautions\nIf a source interface or source IPv6 address is specified for a Telnet server, Telnet users must be able to communicate with the specified source interface or source IPv6 address at Layer 3 to ensure that authorized Telnet users can log in to the server.If the specified source interface is bound to a VPN instance, the VPN instance is automatically bound to the Telnet server. If the interface to which the specified source IPv6 address belongs is bound to a VPN instance, the -vpn-instance parameter must be specified when you specify the IPv6 address for the client.If the VPN instance bound to the specified source interface is deleted, the VPN configuration specified in the telnet ipv6 server-source -a ipv6-address [ -vpn-instance vpn-instance-name ] command is not cleared but does not take effect. In this case, the Telnet server uses the public network instance instead. If the VPN instance with the same name as the deleted one is reconfigured, the VPN function will be restored.If the telnet server-source all-interface command is run, users can log in to the Telnet server through any valid IPv4 interface, which increases system security risks. Therefore, running the telnet server-source all-interface command is not recommended.If the specified source interface is deleted, the interface configuration in the telnet server-source command is not deleted but does not take effect. If the source interface with the same name as the deleted one is reconfigured, the function will be restored.In the interface unnumbered scenario, if the source interface and common source interface (not isolated) are configured and the same IP address and VPN are listened to, the common source interface takes effect. That is, the non-isolation configuration takes effect.Both all-zero listening and interface isolation are configured on the source interface. If the isolation configuration is matched, the isolation configuration takes effect. If the isolation configuration is not matched, the all-zero listening configuration takes effect.The specified IP address is decoupled from the corresponding interface IP address when you configure the isolation source interface. The IP address does not need to be on the specified interface."
