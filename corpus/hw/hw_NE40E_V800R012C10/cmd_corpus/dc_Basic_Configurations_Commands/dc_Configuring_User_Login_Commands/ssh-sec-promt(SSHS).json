    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an SSH client attempts to log in to an SSH server, but the negotiated algorithm is an insecure one, the SSH server generates a risk warning message and sends the message to the SSH client. However, if the SSH client cannot parse this type of message, it fails to interact with the server, leading to a login failure. To prevent this problem, you can run the ssh server security-banner disable command to disable the risk warning function triggered by the SSH server when an insecure algorithm is used between the SSH server and client."
