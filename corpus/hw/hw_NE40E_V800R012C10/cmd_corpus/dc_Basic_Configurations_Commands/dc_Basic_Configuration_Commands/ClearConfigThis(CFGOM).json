    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an interface on a device for other use, original configurations on the interface need to be deleted one by one. If the interface has a large number of configurations, deleting these configurations one-by-one takes a long time and increases the maintenance workload. To reduce the maintenance workload and simplify the deletion operation, you can use this command to perform one-touch configuration clearance on an interface.\nYou can also run the clear configuration interface command in the system view to delete configurations on a specified interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you run the clear configuration this command, the system displays a message, asking you whether to delete the configurations on the specified interface. If you enter Y, all configurations on the specified interface are deleted.\nRunning the clear configuration this command on an interface is similar to running undo commands on the interface in batches."
