    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter acquiring knowledge of defined, undefined, and reserved shortcut keys, you can use a shortcut key to run a command assigned to this shortcut key, and you can also run the hotkey command to assign a command to a shortcut key.\nYou can use a shortcut key as an alternative to a command. After you press a shortcut key, the system displays the complete command associated with the shortcut key. The shortcut key functions the same as the associated command."
