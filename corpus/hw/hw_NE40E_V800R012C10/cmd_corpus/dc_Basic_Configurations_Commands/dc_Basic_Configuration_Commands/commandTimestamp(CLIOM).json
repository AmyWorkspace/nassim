    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a device to record the command execution time in an existing session, run the terminal command timestamp command. After this function is enabled, the date and time when a command is run is displayed after you enter a command and press Enter. If a device does not need to record the command execution time, run the undo terminal command timestamp command to disable the command timestamp function in the existing session.\nPrecautions\nThe terminal command timestamp command takes effect on commands only of an existing session. After you log out from and log in to the device, this function becomes invalid and needs to be reconfigured.\nIf you run the undo terminal command timestamp command to disable the command timestamp function for an existing session after running the timestamp enable command to enable the system timestamp function, timestamps are still displayed after you run display commands."
