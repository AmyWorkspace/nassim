    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prevent other users from accessing the device, you can run the lock command to lock the user interface. The user interface can be the console interface and VTY interface.\nImplementation Procedure\nAfter running the lock command, you need to enter a password twice as prompted to activate the screen save mode. When entering the same password twice, you successfully lock the current user interface. You must enter a password that meets password complexity requirements. After you run the undo user-security-policy enable command in the system view to disable the local user account security policy function, password complexity is not required when you run the lock command and set a screen saver password.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the system is locked, if you attempt to log in to the system, press Enter and then input the correct password as prompted. In this manner, you can unlock the user interface and log in to the system.\nPrecautions\n You cannot log in to the system if forgetting the password. In this case, you must retrieve the password from the administrator or re-configure a password. After the system is locked, the user can enter the password to unlock the system. If the user enters incorrect passwords for multiple consecutive times, the system disconnects the current user."
