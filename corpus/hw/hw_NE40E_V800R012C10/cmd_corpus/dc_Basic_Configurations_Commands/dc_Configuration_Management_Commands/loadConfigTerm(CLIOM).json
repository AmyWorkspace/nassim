    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf one of the devices with the same configurations encounters a configuration change, the configurations of other devices must be changed accordingly to keep configuration consistency. In this case, you can query the configuration differences and paste the differential configurations to those devices. This ensures that the configurations on all the devices are the same.\nPrerequisites\nDifferential configurations with the specified tag have been obtained by running the display configuration commit changes with-tag command on the other devices.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the differential configurations are pasted, the configuration file enters the candidate configuration database. Run the commit command for relevant configurations to take effect.\nPrecautions\nThis function is supported only in the two-phase configuration validation mode."
