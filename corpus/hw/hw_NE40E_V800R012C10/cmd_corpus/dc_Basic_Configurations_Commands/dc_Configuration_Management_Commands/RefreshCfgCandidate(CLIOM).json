    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the system displays a message indicating that the current running configuration is changed when you run the display configuration candidate changes command to view the difference between the candidate configuration and current running configuration, run the refresh configuration candidate command to resolve the configuration conflict so that you can continue to view the configuration difference.\nIf a configuration conflict occurs before you commit the configuration, you can resolve the configuration conflict and then run the commit command to commit the configuration. Alternatively, run the commit command to commit the configuration directly, without resolving the configuration conflict.\nPrecautions\nThis command applies only to the two-phase validation mode."
