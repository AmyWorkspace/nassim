    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA device allows multiple users to perform configurations at the same time. If configurations performed by different users conflict, services will be affected. To prevent this problem, run the lock configuration command to allow only one user to configure the system.\nPrerequisites\nThe configuration locking function is disabled for all users.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the configuration exclusive command is run for a user, the user can perform and commit configurations, and all other users can only query configurations.After the undo configuration exclusive command is run, the configuration locking function is disabled so all users can perform and commit configurations.Only the user for which the configuration locking function is enabled can disable the function; however, if the user does not perform any configurations within the time limit specified by the configuration-occupied timeout command, the device will automatically disable the configuration locking function for the user.\n\nPrecautions\nOnly one user can lock the configuration at a time. After the user logs out, the configuration is unlocked automatically.\nThis command can be run only in a physical system."
