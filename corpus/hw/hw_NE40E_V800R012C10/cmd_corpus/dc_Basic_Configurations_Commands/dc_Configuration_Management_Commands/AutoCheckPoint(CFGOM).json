    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the system to generate a configuration rollback point on each day, run the set save-configuration checkpoint daily command. The configuration rollback point files help perform device rollback.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the set save-configuration checkpoint daily command is run, system configurations are periodically saved in configuration rollback point files. The file content varies with configurations. If system configurations remain unchanged compared with the last configuration rollback point, no new configuration rollback point is generated."
