It can be any visible ASCII character except for the space. However, the string can contain spaces if it is enclosed with double quotation marks (\" \"). The string cannot start with a digit or be a hyphen (-).\nThe value of this parameter must be an existing configuration rollback point on the device. Otherwise, the command cannot be executed."

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo delete a useless configuration rollback point with a specified label, run the clear configuration commit command. The system can generate a maximum of 20 configuration rollback points with labels, 10 periodic configuration rollback points, and five historical periodic configuration rollback points. If a configuration rollback point is no longer useful, run this command to clear it to reduce the system cache information.\nPrecautions\nAfter a configuration rollback point is deleted, system configurations cannot be rolled back to what they were at this configuration rollback point by running rollback commands.\nRun the display configuration commit list and display configuration changes commands to display information about the configuration rollback point. Checking the command output helps prevent misoperations."
