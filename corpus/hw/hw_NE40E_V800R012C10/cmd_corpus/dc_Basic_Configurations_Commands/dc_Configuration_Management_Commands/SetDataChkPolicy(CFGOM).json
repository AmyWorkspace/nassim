    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device data is saved in the central database and service process databases. Each service process database needs to synchronize data from the central database. If the data in a service process database is inconsistent with that in the central database, the host behaviors may not meet operator expectations, causing service function exceptions. Therefore, automatic data verification needs to be enabled to periodically check data consistency between service process databases and the central database. If any inconsistency is detected, an alarm is reported immediately, notifying you of analyzing the impact on services timely. You can restart the board or device to rectify the fault.\nTo enable or disable the automatic data verification function, run this command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
