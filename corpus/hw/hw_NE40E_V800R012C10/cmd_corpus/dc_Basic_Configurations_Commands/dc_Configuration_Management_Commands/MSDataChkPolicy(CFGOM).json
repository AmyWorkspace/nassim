    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn normal situations, configuration data is consistent between the master and slave main control boards of a device. If the configuration data is inconsistent and a master/slave main control board switchover happens to occur, the configuration data on the original master main control board will be lost. To prevent this problem, run the configuration inconsistent slave detect enable command to enable a device to automatically check the configuration data consistency at a specified time. If data inconsistency is detected, the device immediately reports an alarm, prompting you to analyze the impact of the inconsistency on the device. To remove this inconsistency, you can save the current configuration and then restart the device.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
