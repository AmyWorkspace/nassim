    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn Segment Routing implementation, an IGP is used to collect network-wide topology information and assign a label to each router. Therefore, Segment Routing must be enabled for the IGP. If IS-IS is used as the IGP, run the segment-routing mpls command in the IS-IS view to enable Segment Routing.\nPrerequisites\nSegment Routing has been enabled globally, and the device has been enabled to receive and send only the routes with the cost type being wide using the cost-style command.\nPrecautions\nSegment-routing cannot work unless this configuration is done."
