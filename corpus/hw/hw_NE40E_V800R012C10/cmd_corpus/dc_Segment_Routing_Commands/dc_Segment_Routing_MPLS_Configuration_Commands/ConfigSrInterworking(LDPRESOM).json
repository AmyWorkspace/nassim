    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an SR network needs to be connected to an LDP network, LDP LSPs need to be stitched to SR LSPs so that traffic along the LDP LSP can enter the SR LSP for transmission. To enable a device to stitch SR LSPs to the proxy egress LSPs and transit LSPs that are established over non-local host routes with 32-bit masks, run the lsp-trigger segment-routing-interworking best-effort host command. After an SR LSP is stitched to a proxy egress LSP and a transit LSP, traffic over the LDP LSPs can enter the SR LSP.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS LDP has been enabled globally using the mpls command in the system view."
