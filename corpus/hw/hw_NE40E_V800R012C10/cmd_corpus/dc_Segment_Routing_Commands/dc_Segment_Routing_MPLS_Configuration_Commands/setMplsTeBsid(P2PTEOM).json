    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen configuring an intra-AS SR-MPLS TE tunnel, set a binding SID for the tunnel. The binding SID identifies an SR-MPLS TE tunnel and replaces the label stack of an SR-MPLS TE tunnel.\nUsing binding BIDs reduces the number of labels in a label stack on an NE, which helps build a large-scale network. The controller uses both binding SIDs and BGP peer SIDs to compute a path over which an inter-AS E2E SR-MPLS TE tunnel is established.\nPrecautions\nBinding SIDs are set only on SR-MPLS TE tunnels. If binding SIDs are referenced by an explicit path, they cannot be modified or deleted, and the tunnel type cannot be modified."
