    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a dynamic routing protocol used between ASs. BGP egress peer engineering (EPE) is an extension of BGP for segment routing and is used to implement source routing between ASs.\nBGP EPE can allocate BGP peer SIDs to inter-AS paths, and the peer SIDs can then be advertised to a network controller through extended BGP LS functions. The controller orchestrates IGP SIDs and BGP peer SIDs to implement inter-AS forwarding over the optimal path.\nYou can manually plan a group of peers as a peer set and allocate a SID to the group. This SID can correspond to multiple outbound interfaces. After you run the peer peer-set command, the specified peer is added to a peer set."
