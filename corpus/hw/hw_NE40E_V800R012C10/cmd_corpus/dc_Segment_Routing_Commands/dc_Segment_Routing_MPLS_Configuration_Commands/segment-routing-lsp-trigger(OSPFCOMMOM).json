    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter Segment Routing is enabled, a great number of devices establish excessive SR-MPLS BE LSPs, leading to resource wastes. To prevent resource wastes, a policy for establishing SR-MPLS BE LSPs can be configured.\nThe segment-routing lsp-trigger command configures a policy to allow the ingress to use specified routes to establish SR-MPLS BE LSPs. This prevents unwanted SR-MPLS BE LSPs from being established and reduces resource wastes.\nPrerequisites\nIf ip-prefix is to be used, an IP prefix list must have been created using the ip ip-prefix command.\nPrecautions\nThe segment-routing lsp-trigger command takes effect on the ingress, not on transit nodes or the egress."
