To specify a destination IP address in an IP address verification list, run the source-ip-validate list command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nNote the following when configuring this command:\nRun the source-ip command in the MPLS-in-UDP-list view to specify a source IP address in an IP address verification list.Run the validate-list enable command in the MPLS-in-UDP-list view to enable source IP address verification. After the function is enabled and the device receives an MPLS-in-UDP packet, the device verifies the source IP address. The device discards the packet if the verification fails."
