    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn Segment Routing implementation, an IGP is used to collect network-wide topology information and assign a label to each router. Therefore, Segment Routing must be enabled for the IGP. If OSPF is used as the IGP, run the segment-routing mpls command in the OSPF view to enable Segment Routing.\nPrerequisites\nSegment Routing has been enabled globally, and opaque LSA has been enabled using the opaque-capability enable command.\nPrecautions\nSegment routing cannot work unless this configuration is done."
