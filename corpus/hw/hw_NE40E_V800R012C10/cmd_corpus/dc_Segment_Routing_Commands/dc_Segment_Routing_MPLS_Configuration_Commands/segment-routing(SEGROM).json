    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSegment routing (SR) is a protocol designed to forward data packets on a network based on source routes. Segment routing divides a network path into several segments and assigns a segment ID to each segment and network forwarding node. The segments and nodes are sequentially arranged (segment list) to form a forwarding path. To enable segment routing, run the segment-routing command.\nPrecautions\nEnsure that segment routing has been disabled in the IS-IS process before you run the undo segment-routing command in the system view."
