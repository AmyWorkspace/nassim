    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn SR-MPLS TE, an IGP is used to collect network-wide topology information and assign a label to each router. Enabling Segment Routing for an IGP is mandatory. If IS-IS is used, to disable the device from distributing adjacency labels, run the segment-routing auto-adj-sid disable command in the IS-IS view.\nPrerequisites\nSegment Routing has been enabled for a specific IS-IS topology using the segment-routing mpls command."
