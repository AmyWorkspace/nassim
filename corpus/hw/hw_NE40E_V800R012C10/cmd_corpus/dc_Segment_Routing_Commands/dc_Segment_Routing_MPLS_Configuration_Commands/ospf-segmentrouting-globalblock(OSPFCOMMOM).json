    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an SRGB in an existing IGP instance, run the segment-routing global-block command.\nPrerequisites\nConfigure OSPF process first.\nEnable the segment-routing in system-view.\nPrecautions\nWithout this command, segment routing does not work properly, but all segment routing configurations can be operated normally and are not affected.When modifying SRGB, you need to delete the SRGB configuration first. If the undo segment-routing global-block command is run, the original service flaps.As the next hop of the SR route cannot be iterated to the tunnel interface, if the current OSPF process is enabled on a tunnel interface of the type FA and SRGB is configured, the SR label traffic may be discarded."
