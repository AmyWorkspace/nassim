    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMPLS in UDP is a DCN overlay technology that encapsulates MPLS packets (or SR MPLS packets) into UDP packets to traverse through some networks that do not support MPLS or SR MPLS.\nPrecautions\nA device can be configured only as the egress of an MPLS-in-UDP tunnel to properly process MPLS-in-UDP packets. Running the mpls-in-udp command does not trigger the establishment of an MPLS-in-UDP tunnel."
