    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOnly one binding SID can be configured for each SR-MPLS TE Policy. It can be used for SR-MPLS TE path computation as other types of SIDs.\nAn SR-MPLS TE Policy that is manually configured does not carry any binding SID by default. You can configure a binding SID for such an SR-MPLS TE Policy as needed.An SR-MPLS TE Policy dynamically delivered by a controller carries a binding SID by default. If a dynamically delivered SR-MPLS TE Policy does not carry any binding SID, you can manually configure an SR-MPLS TE Policy with the same color and endpoint attributes as the dynamically delivered SR-MPLS TE Policy, and then run the binding-sid command to configure a binding SID for the manually configured SR-MPLS TE Policy. In this way, both SR-MPLS TE Policies can share the same binding SID."
