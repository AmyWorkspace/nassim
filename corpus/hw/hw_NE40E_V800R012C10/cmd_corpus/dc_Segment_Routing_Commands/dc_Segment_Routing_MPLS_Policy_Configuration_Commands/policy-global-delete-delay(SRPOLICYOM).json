    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a delay in deleting the up segment lists, including backup segment lists, of SR-MPLS TE Policies, run the sr-te-policy delete-delay command. If an SR-MPLS TE Policy has a segment list with a higher preference, a segment list switchover may be performed. In this case, the original segment list that is up can still be used and is deleted only when the delay specified using delete-delay-value expires. This prevents traffic interruptions during the segment list switchover.\nPrecautions\nThe sr-te-policy delete-delay command configuration takes effect only for up segment lists in SR-MPLS TE Policies. If seamless bidirectional forwarding detection (SBFD) detects a segment list fault or does not obtain the segment list status, the segment list is considered invalid and then immediately deleted without any delay."
