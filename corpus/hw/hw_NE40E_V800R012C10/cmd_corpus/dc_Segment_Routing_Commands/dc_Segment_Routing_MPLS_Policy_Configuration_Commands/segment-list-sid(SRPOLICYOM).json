    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a SID for a segment list manually planned for an SR-MPLS TE Policy, run the index sid label command.\nYou can run the command multiple times to configure multiple SIDs. The system generates a segment list with a label stack containing SIDs that are placed by index in ascending order. If a candidate path in the SR-MPLS TE Policy is preferentially selected, traffic is forwarded using the segment list of the candidate path. A maximum of 10 SIDs can be configured for each segment list."
