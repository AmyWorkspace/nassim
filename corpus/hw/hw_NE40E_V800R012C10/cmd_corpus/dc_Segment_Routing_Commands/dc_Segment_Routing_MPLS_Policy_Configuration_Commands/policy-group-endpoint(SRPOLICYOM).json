    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDSCP-based traffic steering does not support color-based route recursion. Instead, it recurses a route into an SR-MPLS TE Policy based on the next-hop address in the route. Specifically, it searches for the SR-MPLS TE Policy group matching specific endpoint information and then finds the corresponding SR-MPLS TE Policy based on the DSCP value of packets. Each SR-MPLS TE Policy group can be configured with only one endpoint."
