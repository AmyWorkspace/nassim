    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe reservable bandwidth values set on the interfaces along a TE tunnel are used by the TE module to check whether a link meets all bandwidth requirements. If a fixed bandwidth value is set on an interface and the available physical bandwidth changes on the interface, the TE module cannot correctly evaluate link bandwidth resources if the available bandwidth is different than the configured reservable bandwidth.\nTo address this issue, you can set the dynamic maximum reservable bandwidth and BC dynamic reservable bandwidth. The maximum reservable bandwidth can be determined by setting the proportion of the maximum reservable bandwidth to the actual physical bandwidth. The BC dynamic reservable bandwidth can be determined by setting the proportion of the BC dynamic reservable bandwidth to the maximum reservable bandwidth. In this manner, the TE module can be aware of physical bandwidth changes on the interfaces along a tunnel.\nTo set the proportion of the dynamic maximum reservable bandwidth to the physical bandwidth of a specific interface, run the te bandwidth max-reservable-bandwidth dynamic command.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen both the te bandwidth max-reservable-bandwidth dynamic command and the te bandwidth max-reservable-bandwidth command are run in the same interface view, only the later executed command takes effect.\nAfter the te bandwidth max-reservable-bandwidth dynamic command is run on an interface, only the te bandwidth dynamic command can be used to set the proportion of the BC dynamic reservable bandwidth to the maximum reservable bandwidth.\nPrecautions\nMPLS TE-related commands apply only to MPLS TE and SR-MPLS TE. However, this command applies to SRv6 TE Policies, besides MPLS TE and SR-MPLS TE."
