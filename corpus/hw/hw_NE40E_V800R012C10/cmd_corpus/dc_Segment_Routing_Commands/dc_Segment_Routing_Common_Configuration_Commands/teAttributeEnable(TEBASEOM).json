    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nConventional MPLS TE applies to MPLS and SR-MPLS, but does not apply to SRv6. If TE is also required in SRv6, run the te attribute enable command. The TE feature enabled using this command also applies to MPLS and SR-MPLS.\nIf MPLS TE has been enabled, the device automatically converts existing MPLS TE-related configurations to all-round TE configurations when the te attribute enable command is run. After the command is run, you can perform new TE configurations.\nWhen the undo te attribute enable command is run, the device automatically deletes the configuration of a TE function if the function is not enabled in MPLS and SR-MPLS, but reverts the function configuration back to the MPLS TE-specific configuration if the function is enabled in MPLS or SR-MPLS. If a function is specific to MPLS or SR-MPLS, the function configuration will not be converted to the new TE configuration when the te attribute enable command is run.\nPrecautions\nMPLS TE-related commands apply only to MPLS TE and SR-MPLS TE. However, this command applies to SRv6 TE Policies, besides MPLS TE and SR-MPLS TE."
