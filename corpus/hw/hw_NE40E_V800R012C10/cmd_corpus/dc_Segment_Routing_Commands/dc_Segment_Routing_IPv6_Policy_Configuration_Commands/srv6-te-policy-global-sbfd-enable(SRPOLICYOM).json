    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSRv6 TE Policies are used to direct traffic to traverse an SRv6 network. To improve SRv6 TE Policy reliability, you can run the srv6-te-policy seamless-bfd enable command to enable SBFD for all SRv6 TE Policies. After SBFD is enabled for an SRv6 TE Policy, SBFD is performed on all segment lsits in the primary and backup candidate paths."
