    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable fault detection for a specified SRv6 TE Policy, run the path verification enable command. To disable fault detection for a specified SRv6 TE Policy, run the path verification disable command.\nIf the SRv6 TE Policy view does not have fault detection configuration or the undo path verification command has been run, the srv6-te-policy path verification command configuration in the SRv6 view is inherited.\nAfter fault detection is enabled, The SRPOLICY component check the reachability of the SIDs in the segment list referenced by the SRv6 TE Policy. If they are reachable, the fault detection check of the segment list is up, and vice versa."
