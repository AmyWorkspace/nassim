    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo disable flapping suppression for all SRv6 TE Policies, run the srv6-te-policy suppress-flapping disable command.\nAfter flapping suppression is enabled, if the SID status frequently alternates between up and down, the status changes need to be suppressed. In this case, if the SID status changes to down, the system immediately updates the segment list status to down. However, if the SID status changes to up, the system determines whether flapping suppression is required. If flapping suppression is required, the system changes the SID status to up after a delay and updates the segment list status."
