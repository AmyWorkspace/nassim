    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEach SRv6 TE Policy has a binding SID (BSID). The binding SID provides scalability, network opacity, and service independence.\nAfter a binding SID is configured for an SRv6 TE Policy, the node where the SRv6 TE Policy is configured can function as a stitching node. Only one binding SID can be configured for each SRv6 TE Policy.\nPrerequisites\nRun the srv6-te-policy locator command to associate the SRv6 TE Policy with a Locator, and then you can configure the Binding SID of the SRv6 TE Policy within the Locator."
