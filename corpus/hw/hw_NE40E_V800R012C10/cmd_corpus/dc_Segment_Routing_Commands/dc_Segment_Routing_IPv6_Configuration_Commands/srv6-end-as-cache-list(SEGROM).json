The SID is configured according to the label sequence in the packet.\nPrecautions\nTo prevent service packets from being looped between SFFs, the two SIDs in the cache list are not allowed to be the same.The local End.AS SID must be in other addresses except the first address.Ensure that the first SID is the SID of the private End.DT4, and the device does not check the SID.The cache list configuration must be the end-to-end path of the SRv6 TE Policy."
