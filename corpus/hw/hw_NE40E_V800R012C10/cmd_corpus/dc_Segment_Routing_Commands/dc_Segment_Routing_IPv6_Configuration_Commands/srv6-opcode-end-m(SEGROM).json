    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nServices that recurse to an SRv6 TE Policy must be strictly forwarded through the path defined using the segment lists in the SRv6 TE Policy. Considering that the egress of the SRv6 TE Policy is also fixed, if a single point of failure occurs on the egress, service forwarding may fail. To prevent this problem, configure egress protection for the SRv6 TE Policy.\nIn the SRv6 egress protection scenario, you need to execute this command to configure End.M SID on this node to protect another node's Locator.\nPrecautions\nTo ensure proper forwarding, configured static SIDs and IPv6 addresses configured on interfaces cannot conflict with each other."
