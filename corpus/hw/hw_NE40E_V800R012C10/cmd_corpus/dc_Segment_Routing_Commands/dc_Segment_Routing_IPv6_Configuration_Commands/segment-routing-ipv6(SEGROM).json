    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSegment Routing IPv6 (SRv6) is used to forward IPv6 data packets based on the source route concept. IPv6 forwarding plane-based SRv6 enables the ingress to add a Segment Routing header (SRH) into IPv6 packets. An explicit IPv6 address stack is pushed into the SRH. Transit nodes continue to update IPv6 destination IP addresses and the offset address stack to implement per-hop forwarding.\nTo enable SRv6, run the segment-routing ipv6 command. An IPv6 SID can then be set in the SRv6 view and used to generate an IPv6 local SID forwarding entry."
