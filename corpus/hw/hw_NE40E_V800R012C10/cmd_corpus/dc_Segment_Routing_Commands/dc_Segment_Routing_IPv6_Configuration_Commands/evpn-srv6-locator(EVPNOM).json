    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an EVPN VPWS scenario, if service traffic needs to be carried over an SRv6 path, run the segment-routing ipv6 locator command to add the SID attribute to the EVPN routes to be sent. Upon receipt of EVPN routes from a BGP EVPN peer, the local device can recurse routes over an SRv6 path based on the SID attribute carried in routes.\nIf a static SID is configured under the referenced locator, the static SID will be used first."
