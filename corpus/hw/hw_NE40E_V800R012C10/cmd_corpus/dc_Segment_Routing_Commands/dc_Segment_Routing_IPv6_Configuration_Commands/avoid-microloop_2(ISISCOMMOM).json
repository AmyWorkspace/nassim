    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a network fault occurs or is rectified, an IGP performs route convergence. A transient forwarding status inconsistency between nodes results in different convergence rates on devices, which poses the risk of micro-loops. After anti-micro loop is enabled for SRv6 by using the ipv6 avoid-microloop segment-routing command, the ingress forwards packets strictly along an explicit path during IGP convergence. The forwarding is irrelevant to IGP convergence of devices, which prevents micro-loops.\nTo set a delay in delivering IS-IS routes in SRv6, run the ipv6 avoid-microloop segment-routing rib-update-delay command."
