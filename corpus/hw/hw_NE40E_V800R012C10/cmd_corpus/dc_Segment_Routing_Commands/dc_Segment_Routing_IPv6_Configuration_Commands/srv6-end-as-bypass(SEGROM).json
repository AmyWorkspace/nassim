    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the SF service is faulty, the bypass path is degraded to the original SRv6 forwarding. If a backup SF is configured, you can configure the bypass path to be configured as the backup SF. The application scenarios are as follows:\n When the SF service is faulty, the traffic is discarded by default. If the bypass keyword is configured but the bypass SID value is not carried, the SF is skipped and the original SRv6 forwarding is degraded. If the bypass keyword is configured and the bypass SID value is SF2, the SF2 protection SF is considered and the traffic is forwarded to the SF2 for service processing."
