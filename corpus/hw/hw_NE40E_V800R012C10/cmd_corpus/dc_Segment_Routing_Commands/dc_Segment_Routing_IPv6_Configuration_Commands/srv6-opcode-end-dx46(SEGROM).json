    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn SRv6 SID is a 128-bit IPv6 address expressed in the Locator:Function:Args format. The Function field is also called Opcode, and different operation codes define different functions.\nStatic operation codes must be configured within the static operation code segment. The length of a static operation code segment is configured through the static static-length parameter in the locator command to determine the number of static operation codes that can be configured in a specified locator range.\nAfter you run the opcode command to configure various types of operation codes, the Locator, Opcode, and Args fields form a unique SRv6 SID. The SRv6 SID is then added to the local SID table on the device. In forwarding, the Locator field in the SRv6 SID instructs other nodes to find the SRv6 SID generation node through addressing and forward SRv6 packets to the node; the Opcode field instructs the SRv6 SID generation node to implement corresponding functions.\nEnd.DX4/End.DX6 (short for decapsulation and IPv4/IPv6 cross-connect) supports packet decapsulation and forwarding to a specified IPv4/IPv6 Layer 3 adjacency. End.DX4/End.DX6 SIDs are mainly used in L3VPNv4/L3VPNv6 scenarios as per-CE VPN SIDs.\nEnd.DX4/End.DX6 can be disassembled into End + D + X4/X6, where D indicates decapsulation, and X4/X6 indicates IPv4/IPv6 cross-connect (meaning that a packet needs to be directly forwarded to a specified IPv4/IPv6 Layer 3 adjacency). Therefore, each End.DX4/End.DX6 SID needs to be bound to one or a group of IPv4/IPv6 Layer 3 adjacencies.\nThe End.DX4/End.DX6 SID instruction includes the following operations:\n Removes the outer IPv6 header and SRH. Forwards the inner IPv4/IPv6 packet to the IPv4/IPv6 Layer 3 adjacency bound to the End.DX4/End.DX6 SID.\n\nPrecautions\nTo ensure proper forwarding, configured static SIDs and IPv6 addresses configured on interfaces cannot conflict with each other."
