    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe sr-te frr enable command enables protection during SRv6 forwarding. With this function enabled, if the value of the Segments Left (SL) field in a packet is greater than 0 or the value of the SL field in a packet with an SRH is 0, the device decreases the value by 1 and uses the next-layer SRv6 SID as the destination address to prevent packet forwarding failures in any of the following scenarios:\nNo available route is found due to a FIB-Miss error.IPv6 DA is the address of a local interface that is down, and node protection is not implemented through TI-LFA FRR.The local SID is an End.X SID, and the outbound interface is down.The route queried from the involved routing table is a NULL0 route.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the sr-te frr enable command is run in any VS, TE FRR is supported. Only after the undo sr-te frr enable command is run in all VSs, TE FRR is not supported."
