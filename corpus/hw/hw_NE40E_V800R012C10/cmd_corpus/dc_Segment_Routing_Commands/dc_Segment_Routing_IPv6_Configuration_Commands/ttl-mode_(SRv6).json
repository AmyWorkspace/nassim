    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the scenario of the public network IP iteration SRv6 TE Policy, the SRv6 TE Policy has two modes for processing TTL:\nUniform mode: At the ingress node, the TTL value of the inner packet is decremented by 1 and then mapped to the IPv6 TTL field. Thereafter, the packet is processed in the IPv6 network according to the standard TTL processing. At the egress node, the IPv6 TTL is decremented by 1 and then mapped to the TTL field of the inner packet.Pipe mode: The inner message is decremented by only 1 at the ingress and egress, and the entire SRv6 TE Policy is treated as 1 hop."
