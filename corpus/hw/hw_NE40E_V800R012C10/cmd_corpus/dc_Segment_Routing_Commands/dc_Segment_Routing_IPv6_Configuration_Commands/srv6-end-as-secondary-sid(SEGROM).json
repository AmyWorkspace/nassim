    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSRv6 SFC supports backup link protection. In backup link protection, an SF is dual-homed to two SFFs, with one as the master, and the other as the backup. The backup SFF is used to protect the primary SFF. If the primary SFF becomes unreachable, services are switched to the backup SFF for processing. The peer SID of the master SFF is the End SID of the backup SFF. The proxy peer-sid command is used to specify the End SID of the backup SFF on the master SFF.\nPrecautions\nTo ensure that the protection function is correctly configured, the peer-sid must be the End SID on the backup SFF and cannot be in the same locator as the End.AS SID."
