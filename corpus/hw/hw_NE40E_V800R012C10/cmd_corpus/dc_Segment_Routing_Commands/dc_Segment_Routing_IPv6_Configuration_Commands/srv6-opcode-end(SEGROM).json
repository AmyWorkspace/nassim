    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn SRv6 SID is a 128-bit IPv6 address expressed in the Locator:Function:Args format. The Function field is also called Opcode, and different operation codes define different functions. Operation codes can be dynamically assigned using an IGP or be configured using the opcode command.\nStatic operation codes must be configured within the static operation code segment to prevent conflicts with dynamically assigned operation codes. The length of a static operation code segment is configured through the static static-length parameter in the locator command to determine the number of static operation codes that can be configured in a specified locator range.\nAfter you run the opcode command to configure various types of operation codes, the Locator, Opcode, and Args fields form a unique SRv6 SID. The SRv6 SID is then added to the local SID table on the device and also advertised externally through a routing protocol. In forwarding, the Locator field in the SRv6 SID instructs other nodes to find the SRv6 SID generation node through addressing and forward SRv6 packets to the node; the Opcode field instructs the SRv6 SID generation node to implement corresponding functions.\nEnd is the most basic SRv6 instruction. A SID bound to the End instruction is called an End SID, which identifies a node. An End SID instructs a network node to forward a packet to the node that advertises the SID. After receiving the packet, the node performs the operations defined by the SID for packet processing.\nThe End SID instruction includes the following operations:\n Decrements the SL value by 1. Obtains the next SID from the SRH based on the SL value. Updates the DA field in the IPv6 header with the next SID. Searches the corresponding routing table for packet forwarding.\n\nPrecautions\nTo ensure proper forwarding, configured static SIDs and IPv6 addresses configured on interfaces cannot conflict with each other."
