    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn SRv6 SID is a 128-bit IPv6 address expressed in the Locator:Function:Args format. The Function field is also called Opcode, and different operation codes define different functions. Operation codes can be dynamically assigned using a BGP or be configured using the opcode command.\nStatic operation codes must be configured within the static operation code segment to prevent conflicts with dynamically assigned operation codes. The length of a static operation code segment is configured through the static static-length parameter in the locator command to determine the number of static operation codes that can be configured in a specified locator range.\nAfter you run the opcode command to configure various types of operation codes, the Locator, Opcode, and Args fields form a unique SRv6 SID. The SRv6 SID is then added to the local SID table on the device and also advertised externally through a routing protocol. In forwarding, the Locator field in the SRv6 SID instructs other nodes to find the SRv6 SID generation node through addressing and forward SRv6 packets to the node; the Opcode field instructs the SRv6 SID generation node to implement corresponding functions.\nEnd.DT6 (short for decapsulation and specific IPv6 table lookup) supports packet decapsulation and lookup in a specified IPv6 routing table for packet forwarding. End.DT6 SIDs are mainly used in L3VPNv6 scenarios as per-VPN SIDs.\nEnd.DT6 can be disassembled into End + D + T6, where D indicates decapsulation and T6 indicates IPv6 table lookup for forwarding. Therefore, each End.DT6 SID needs to be bound to an IPv6 routing table, which can be either the IPv6 routing table of a VPN instance or a common IPv6 routing table.\nThe End.DT6 SID instruction includes the following operations:\n Removes the outer IPv6 header and SRH. Searches the IPv6 routing table bound to the End.DT6 SID to forward the inner IPv6 packet.\n\nPrecautions\nTo ensure proper forwarding, configured static SIDs and IPv6 addresses configured on interfaces cannot conflict with each other."
