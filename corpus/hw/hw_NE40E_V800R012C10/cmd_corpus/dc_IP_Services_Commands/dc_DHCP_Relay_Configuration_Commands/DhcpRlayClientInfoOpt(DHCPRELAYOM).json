    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo locate the fault that a DHCP client fails to correctly obtain an IP address, run the dhcp relay client-info command to configure a DHCP relay agent to record specified DHCP packets. After that, the DHCP relay agent records the information exchanged between the DHCP client and server based on the specified option code and sub-option code in DHCP packets.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the dhcp relay client-info command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.With the option code and sub-option code specified, the DHCP relay agent records a maximum of 2500 qualified DHCP packets. If more than 2500 such DHCP packets exist, the latest record overwrites the earliest one."
