To configure an IP address on a DHCP relay agent to implement the plug-and-play function, run the ip relay source-ip-address command.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nDHCP relay has been enabled using the dhcp select relay command.\n\nPrecautions\n\nIf this command has been run in both the system view and interface view, the command executed in the interface view has a higher priority."
