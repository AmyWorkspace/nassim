    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a DHCP relay scenario, if users go online from the interface that uses an unnumbered IP address, the device saves entries of access users. To prevent user entries from being lost due to a device restart, run the dhcp relay unnumbered table autosave command to enable the device to store user entries, so that the saved entries can be automatically restored after a device restart.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the dhcp relay unnumbered table write-delay command to set the interval for storing user entries on a DHCP relay agent.\nPrecautions\nEnsure that all user entries have been saved before a device restart."
