    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe option fields in a DHCP packet store some control information and parameters that are not defined in common protocols. An option field consists of the Code, Length, and Value. The option 82 field refers to the option field in which the value of Code is 82.\nThe option 82 field contains the location information of DHCP hosts, such as information about login interface, VLAN, and address. The option 82 field helps create DHCP snooping binding entries with accurate interface information. DHCP relays specify clients and policies for IP address assignment based on the option 82 field. For example, the DHCP server assigns IP addresses in a network segment for the clients that logs in from Ethernet 1/0/1. The DHCP server assigns IP addresses in another network segment for the clients that logs in from Ethernet 1/0/2.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the dhcp option82 rebuild enable command is run, the device inserts the Option 82 field into a DHCP packet if no Option 82 field exists in the packet. If the Option 82 field exists in a DHCP packet, the device deletes the Option 82 field and inserts a new Option 82 field into the packet.\nIf the dhcp option82 rebuild enable command and the dhcp option82 insert enable (VLAN view) command are run in the BD view, the later configuration takes effect."
