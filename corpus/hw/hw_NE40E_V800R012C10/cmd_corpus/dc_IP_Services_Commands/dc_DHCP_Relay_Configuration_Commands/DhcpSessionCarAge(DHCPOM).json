    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCAR for whitelisted DHCP sessions is enabled by default. A device generates whitelists based on information in DHCP packets from different DHCP servers to isolate the packets. After a whitelist is generated, if the device does not receive packets from the DHCP server to which the whitelist belongs within 30 minutes, it ages out the whitelist by default. To adjust the aging time of a whitelist involved in CAR for whitelisted DHCP sessions, run the whitelist session-car dhcp aging-time command."
