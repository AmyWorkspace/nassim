    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, CAR for whitelisted DHCP sessions is enabled to isolate the sessions. This prevents DHCP packets from different DHCP servers from preempting one another's bandwidth resources. If CAR for whitelisted DHCP sessions is abnormal, you can run the whitelist session-car dhcp disable command to disable this function so that DHCP packets can be sent to the CPU properly. Under normal circumstances, enabling CAR for whitelisted DHCP sessions is recommended."
