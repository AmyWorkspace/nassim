    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ND protocol has powerful functions. However, if there is no security mechanism, the ND protocol can be easily used by attackers. The system collects statistics about ND messages sent to the CPU based on the source MAC addresses of the messages. You can run the ipv6 nd source-mac max-detect-number command to set the maximum number of ND messages with fixed source MAC addresses that can be detected, preventing message attacks."
