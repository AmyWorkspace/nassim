If not, the NS message is discarded.NA: The system checks whether the source MAC address is the same as the MAC address in the TLLA. If not, the NA message is discarded.RS: The system checks whether the source MAC address is the same as the MAC address in the SLLA. If not, the RS message is discarded.RA: The system checks whether the source MAC address is the same as the MAC address in the SLLA. If not, the RA message is discarded."
