    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a large number of NS messages are sent to a main control board, the CPU usage of the main control board may be high. To resolve this issue, run the nd fast-reply enable command to enable ND fast reply. After the command is run, NS messages are sent to an interface board instead of a main control board, and the interface board responds with NA messages.\nPrecautions\nThis command does not support the LPUF-50/LPUF-50-L/LPUI-21-L/LPUI-51-L/LPUF-51/LPUF-51-B/LPUI-51/LPUI-51-B/LPUS-51/LPUF-101/LPUF-101-B/LPUI-101/LPUI-101-B/LPUS-101 or VSUF."
