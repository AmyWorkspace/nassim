    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ND protocol has powerful functions. However, if there is no security mechanism, the ND protocol can be easily used by attackers. The system collects statistics about ND messages sent to the CPU based on the source MAC addresses of the messages. You can run the ipv6 nd source-mac threshold command to set an attack detection threshold for ND messages with fixed source MAC addresses. If the number of ND messages with the same source MAC address received within 5 seconds exceeds a specified threshold, the system considers that an attack occurs and adds the MAC address to an attack entry. Before the attack entry ages out. If a MAC address is added to an ND attack entry, the MAC address is aged out after the aging time expires."
