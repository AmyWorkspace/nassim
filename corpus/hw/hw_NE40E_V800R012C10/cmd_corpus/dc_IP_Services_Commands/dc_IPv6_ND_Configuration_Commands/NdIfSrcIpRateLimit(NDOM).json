    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf users send a large number of ND packets to a device. Many resources are diverted into processing these ND packets, and the processing of other services is affected. To resolve this problem, run the ipv6 nd anti-attack rate-limit source-ip (interface view) command to set the rate limit value for ND packets based on interface source IP, avoid the waste of equipment on processing ND packets to ensure the normal operation of other services.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter set the rate limit value for ND packets based on interface source IP, the device counts the number of received ND packets. If the number of ND packets received in a specified period exceeds the upper limit, the device discards the excess ND packets. As a result, the device may fail to process some valid ND packets, causing service interruptions.\nPrecautions\nIf the rate limit is too low and the login through Telnet fails because the device receives a large number of attack packets, you can log in to the device through the Console port to increase the rate limit."
