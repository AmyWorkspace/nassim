    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve network reliability, you can run the ipv6 nd auto-detect enable command to enable the auto-detection of ND entries so that the system can send Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages to probe whether its neighbors are reachable before aging ND entries.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the system receives a Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message from a neighbor responding to the sent NS message, the system updates the aging time of the ND entries. If the system does not receive any NA message, the ND entries automatically age.\nYou are recommended to keep the auto-detection of ND entries enabled.\nPrecautions\nIf the auto-detection of ND entries is not enabled, the system directly deletes ND entries when the aging time of ND entries expires or the system no longer probes the reachability of its neighbors after the aging time of the passively established ND entries expires."
