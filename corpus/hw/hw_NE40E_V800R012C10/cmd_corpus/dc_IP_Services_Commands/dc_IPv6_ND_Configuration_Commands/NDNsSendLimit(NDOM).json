    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the peer device is limited by the capability of receiving NS messages or the local device is limited by the capability of processing NA response messages, run the ipv6 nd ns send rate-limit command to configure the rate limit of sending NS messages for address resolution or parsing. This prevents a failure to learn ND entries or incorrect deletion of ND entries due to discarding of NA packets.\nConfiguration Impact\nif the rate limit of sending NS messages is a small value, the address resolution of a large number of neighbor entries becomes slow.\nPrecautions\nUsing the default rate limit value is recommended. Exercise caution while using this command to configure the rate limit of sending NS messages for address resolution or parsing."
