    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nWhen a device receives a valid NS message on an interface, the device checks whether IPv6 addresses with the same network prefix exist on the interface. If so, the device replies with an NA message and generates dynamic neighbor entries. If not, the device performs the following operations:\n\nIf the strict prefix learning function for dynamic neighbor entries is enabled on the interface, the device simply discards the NS message and does not generate dynamic neighbor entries.\nIf the strict prefix learning function for dynamic neighbor entries is disabled on the interface, the device replies with an NA message and generates dynamic neighbor entries.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe IPv6 function has been enabled using the ipv6 enable command.\n\nPrecautions\n\n\nAfter the strict prefix learning function is enabled for dynamic neighbor entries, the device does not delete the learned dynamic neighbor entries corresponding to different address prefixes. Instead, the device waits for the entries to automatically age out.\nThe configuration of the strict prefix learning function for dynamic neighbor entries in the interface view has a higher priority than that in the system view."
