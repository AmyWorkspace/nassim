    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ND protocol has powerful functions. However, if there is no security mechanism, the ND protocol can be easily used by attackers. The system collects statistics about ND messages sent to the CPU based on the source MAC addresses of the messages. If the number of ND messages with the same source MAC address received within 5 seconds exceeds a specified threshold, the system considers that an attack occurs and adds the MAC address to an attack entry. You can run the ipv6 nd source-mac max-entry-number command to set the maximum number of ND attack entries with fixed source MAC addresses. This prevents memory consumption by a large number of entries."
