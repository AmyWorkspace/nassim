    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the remote device has a limited capability of receiving NA messages or the local device has a limited capability of processing neighbor solicitation (NS) messages, run the ipv6 nd na send rate-limit command on the local device to set a limit on the rate at which NA messages are sent. This prevents a failure to learn ND entries or incorrect deletion of ND entries caused by NA message discarding.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the rate limit is set to a small value, address resolution becomes slow in the case of a large number of neighbor entries."
