    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an attacker keeps sending SEND messages to a device, the device will be busy verifying the RSA signature. To limit the rate at which the interface verifies the RSA signature of the SEND messages, you can run the ipv6 nd security rate-limit command. If the rate at which the interface verifies the RSA signature of the SEND messages is out of the allowed range, the device will regard these messages insecure and discard them."
