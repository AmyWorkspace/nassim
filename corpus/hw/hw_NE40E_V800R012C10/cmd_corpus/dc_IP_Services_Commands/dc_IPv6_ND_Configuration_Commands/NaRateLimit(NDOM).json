    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a device is under an attack, a large number of NA messages are received within a short period of time. As a result, lots of CPU resources are used in neighbor entry learning and response, which affects the processing of other services. To resolve this problem, run the ipv6 nd na anti-attack rate-limit command to configure the rate at which NA messages are sent. With this configuration, when the number of NA messages received exceeds the specified threshold, the device discards the excess NA messages."
