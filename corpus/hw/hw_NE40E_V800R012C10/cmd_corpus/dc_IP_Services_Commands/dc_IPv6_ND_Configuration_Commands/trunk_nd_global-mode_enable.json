    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen interfaces on different boards are added to an Eth-Trunk interface in unicast scenarios, the device delivers ND entries to the boards where the Eth-Trunk member interfaces reside by default. For example, if Eth-Trunk 1 has two member interfaces (member interfaces 1 and 2), the device delivers ND entries only to the boards where the two member interfaces reside by default. When another interface (member interface 3) is added to Eth-Trunk 1 and it is the first interface on its board to be added, the device must deliver ND entries to the board where member interface 3 resides. If traffic is forwarded through member interface 3, packet loss occurs for a short period of time. To resolve this issue, run the trunk nd global-mode enable command. After the command is run, the device delivers ND entries to all boards, regardless of whether interfaces are added to or removed from the Eth-Trunk interface.\nIf an Eth-Trunk interface is configured on a device, you are advised to enable the device to deliver ND entries to all boards as required. After the function is enabled, ND entry resources on all boards (even those without Eth-Trunk member interfaces) are consumed."
