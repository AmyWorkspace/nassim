    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the remote device has a limited capability of receiving RS messages, run the ipv6 nd rs send rate-limit command on the local device to set a limit on the rate at which RS messages are sent. This prevents the remote device from discarding RS messages due to its limited processing capability.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the rate limit is set to a small value, the local device takes a long time to learn the default route."
