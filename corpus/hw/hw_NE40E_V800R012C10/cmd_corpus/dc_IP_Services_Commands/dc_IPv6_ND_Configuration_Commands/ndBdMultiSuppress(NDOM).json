    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a network device receives an NS message to implement address resolution, the device forwards the NS message within its own BD. This NS message is received only by the nodes with the last 24 bits the same as the multicast address. If a device receives a large number of NS messages within a specified period, forwarding these NS messages uses excessive network resources and leads to network congestion and deteriorated network performance. As a result, user services are affected.\nTo resolve this problem, run the ipv6 nd multicast-suppress enable command to enable NS multicast suppression. With NS multicast suppression enabled, upon receipt of an NS message, a device checks whether the NS message contains information about the end user. If so, the device simply implements proxy ND or converts multicast streams to unicast streams. If not, the device forwards the NS message based on the original process. This reduces or suppresses message flooding occurred during address resolution.\nPrecautions\nBefore NS multicast suppression is enabled, ensure that the encapsulation type of the Layer 2 sub-interface bound to the BD domain is not any of the following types:\nDefaultDot1q transparent transmissionQinQ transparent transmission"
