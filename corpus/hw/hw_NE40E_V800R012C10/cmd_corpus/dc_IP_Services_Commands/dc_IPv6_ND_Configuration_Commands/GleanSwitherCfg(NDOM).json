    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nBy default, a device perform the following operations upon receipt of legitimate NS/NA packets:\n\nWhen an interface where neighbor entries exist receives legitimate NS packets, the values of neighbor entries are updated. When an interface where neighbor entries do not exist receives legitimate NS packets, neighbor entries are generated on the interface.\nWhen an interface where neighbor entries exist receives legitimate NA packets, the values of neighbor entries are updated. When an interface where neighbor entries do not exist receives legitimate NA packets, the NA packets are simply discarded.\n\nWhen an interface has no neighbor entries configured, to avoid the device from simply discarding legitimate NA packets and prevent packet loss, run the ipv6 nd na glean command."
