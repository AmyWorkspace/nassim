    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the remote device has a limited capability of receiving RA messages or the local device has a limited capability of processing router solicitation (RS) messages, run the ipv6 nd ra send rate-limit command on the local device to set a limit on the rate at which RA messages are sent. This prevents a host from failing to update the default routing information.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the rate limit is set to a small value, the rate at which a host updates the default routing information becomes slow."
