    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen you configure IPv6 addresses (including global unicast IPv6 addresses and link-local IPv6 addresses) for interfaces, the DAD function is required. DAD verifies the uniqueness of new unicast IPv6 addresses before the addresses are assigned to interfaces on the local link. It ensures that the IPv6 address to be allocated to an interface is not used by any other interfaces connected with this interface and thus avoids address conflicts.\nPrerequisites\nIPv6 has been enabled on the involved interface using the ipv6 enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the number of NS messages that are sent when DAD is performed is set to 0, it indicates that DAD is prohibited.\nPrecautions\nWhen the physical link on an interface fails, DAD cannot be implemented on the interface.\nWhen traffic is heavy, setting the value to a larger value is recommended to increase the number of NS messages that can be sent."
