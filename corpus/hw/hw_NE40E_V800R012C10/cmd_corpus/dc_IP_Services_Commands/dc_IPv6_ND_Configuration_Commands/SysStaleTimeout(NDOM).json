    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe STALE state of an ND entry indicates that whether the neighbor is reachable is unknown. Probing whether the neighbor is reachable is not performed unless there is a packet to be sent to this neighbor.\nThe timeout period of the STALE state of ND entries is a variable. If you want to quickly clear invalid ND entries, you can set the timeout period to a smaller value through the ipv6 nd stale-timeout command to speed up entry aging.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ipv6 nd stale-timeout command is run, the status of ND entries can be updated after the timeout period of the STALE state of ND entries expires.\nPrecautions\nThe system probes the validity of ND entries again after the timeout period of the STALE state of ND entries expires. If the neighbor is reachable, the ND entry status changes to REACHABLE; otherwise, the ND entry is deleted.\nAn ND entry contains information about the IPv6 address of the neighbor, link-layer address of the neighbor, status of the ND entry, interface name of the ND entry, time when the ND entry is created, VLAN ID of the ND entry, and VPN name of the neighbor. For detailed explanation, see the description of the output of the display ipv6 neighbors command."
