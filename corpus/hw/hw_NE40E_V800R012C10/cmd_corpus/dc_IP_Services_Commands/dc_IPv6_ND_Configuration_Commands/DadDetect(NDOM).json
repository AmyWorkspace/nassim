    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an IPv6 address is configured for a device or the interface status changes, the device performs DAD. In loopback scenarios, the detection ends after DAD detects an address conflict. To resolve address conflicts after loopback release, you must reconfigure an IPv6 address or change the interface status so that the device performs DAD again. This causes a long service interruption. After the undo ipv6 nd dad loopback-detect disable command is run and DAD detects an address conflict, DAD continues detection until any of the following situations occurs:\nThe loopback is released. DAD stops continuing detection and the address conflict state is released.An NS message is received from a neighbor. DAD ends and the address conflict state is maintained.An NA message is received from a neighbor. DAD ends and the address conflict state is maintained."
