    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nTo filter the illegal packets, you can create static ND entries, binding the destination IPv6 addresses of these packets to nonexistent MAC addresses.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore running the ipv6 neighbor command to configure a static entry, you need to run the ipv6 enable command in the interface view to enable the IPv6 function on the interface.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nAn ND entry enters the REACHABLE state after being created, indicating that the interface connected to this neighbor is Up. If the interface connected to this neighbor turns Down, the ND entry needs to be deleted.\nThe static ND entries overwrite the ND entries dynamically learnt by routers. That is, static ND entries are of higher priorities than dynamically learnt ND entries.\n\nPrecautions\n\nYou can configure a maximum of 16K static ND entries on an interface.\nIf the IPv6 address or MAC address specified in the ipv6 neighbor command is incorrect, communication with this neighbor fails.\nYou can run the reset ipv6 neighbors command to delete dynamic ND entries."
