    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNS multicast suppression can be enabled to reduce or suppress packet flooding occurred during address resolution. With NS multicast suppression enabled, upon receipt of an NS message, a device checks whether the NS message contains information about the end user. If so, the device simply implements proxy ND or converts multicast streams to unicast streams. If not, the device forwards the NS message based on the original process. During interconnection with a third-party device, if the proxy ND entries that a peer device synchronizes with the local device through EVPN routes do not carry the R flag, the local device cannot determine whether the device that replies with an NA message is a router or a host. To configure the R flag for NA messages, run the ipv6 nd multicast-suppress command.\nPrerequisites\nNS multicast suppression has been enabled using the ipv6 nd multicast-suppress { proxy-reply [ unknown-options-unicast ] | unicast-forward } [ mismatch-discard ] enable command in the BD view."
