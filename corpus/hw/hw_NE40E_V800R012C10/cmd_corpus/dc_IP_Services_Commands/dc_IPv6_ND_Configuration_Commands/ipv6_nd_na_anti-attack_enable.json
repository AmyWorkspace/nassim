    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a device is attacked, it receives a large number of NA messages within a short period. As a result, the device consumes many CPU resources to learn and respond to peer entries, affecting processing of other services. To resolve this issue, run the ipv6 nd na anti-attack enable command. After NA message attack defense is enabled, only NA messages in response to the NS messages sent from the device are sent to the CPU for processing. The other NA messages are discarded.\nPrecautions\nLPUF-50/LPUF-50-L/LPUI-21-L/LPUI-51-L/LPUF-51/LPUF-51-B/LPUI-51/LPUI-51-B/LPUS-51/LPUF-101/LPUF-101-B/LPUI-101/LPUI-101-B/LPUS-101 boards do not support this configuration."
