    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a DNS client sends a DNS query request to a DNS server, it initializes the retransmission count and starts the DNS query response timer. If the timer expires, the retransmission count increases by 1. When the retransmission count exceeds the specified value, the client stops sending packets to this DNS server and starts sending query request packets to a next DNS server. To configure the number of retransmission times for DNS query packets, run the dns try command. You can run the dns timeout command to configure the DNS query response timer."
