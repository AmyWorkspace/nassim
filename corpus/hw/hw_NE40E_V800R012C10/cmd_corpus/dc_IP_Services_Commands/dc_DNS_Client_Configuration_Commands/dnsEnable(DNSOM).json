    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf you want to obtain the IP addresses of destination hosts through their host names (for example, when you perform the ping or tracert operation), you can use dynamic DNS. The dns resolve command allows you to enable dynamic DNS.\nUsing dynamic DNS for domain name resolution takes a long time. Sometimes, you may want to use static DNS instead. In this case, you can run the undo dns resolve command to disable dynamic DNS."
