    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn ACL6 step is the difference between two adjacent and automatically allocated ACL6 rule numbers. For example, if the step is set to 5, rule numbers start at 5 and increase by an increment of 5, yielding rule numbers of 5, 10, 15, 20, and so on.\nTo specify an ACL6 step, run the step command.\nYou can use an ACL6 step to maintain ACL6 rules and add new ACL6 rules conveniently.\nAssume that a user has created four rules numbered from 1 to 4 in an ACL6. The user can reconfigure the ACL6 step, for example, to 2 by running the step 2 command in the ACL6 view. The original rule numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are renumbered as 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively. After that, the user can run the rule 3 xxxx command to add a rule numbered 3 between the renumbered rules 2 and 4.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe numbers of rules in an ACL6 realign automatically when the ACL6 step changes.\nPrecautions\nChanging the ACL6 step causes rule numbers to change but does not affect the rules' priorities."
