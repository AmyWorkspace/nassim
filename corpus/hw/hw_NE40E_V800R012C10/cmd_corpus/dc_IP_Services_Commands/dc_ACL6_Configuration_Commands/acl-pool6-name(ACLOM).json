    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn typical ACL6 usage scenarios such as QoS or security service, to filter traffic based on the source IPv6 addresses of BGP peers, run the acl ipv6-pool command to create an ACL IPv6 address pool.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the apply bgp-peer command to associate IPv6 addresses of BGP peers with the ACL IPv6 address pool.\nPrecautions\nCurrently, the device only supports IPv6 address pools for advance ACLs."
