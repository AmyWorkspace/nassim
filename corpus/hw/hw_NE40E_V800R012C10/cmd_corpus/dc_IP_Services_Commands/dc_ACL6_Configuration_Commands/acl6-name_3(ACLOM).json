    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA basic ACL6 defines rules for filtering packets based on the source IP addresses of packets. To create a basic ACL6, run the acl ipv6 command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe undo acl ipv6 all command deletes all types of ACL6s on a device. If the ACL6s being deleted are applied to services, these services are interrupted. Before deleting an ACL6, ensure that the ACL6 is not referenced by services.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the rule command to configure a rule for a created basic ACL6. Then the ACL6 rule can be applied to match packets.\nRun the description command to configure a description for a created basic ACL6. The description can contain the functions of the basic ACL6, facilitating applications."
