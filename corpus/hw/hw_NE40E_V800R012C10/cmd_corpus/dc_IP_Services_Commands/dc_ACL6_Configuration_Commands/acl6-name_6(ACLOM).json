To create a user ACL6, run the acl ipv6 command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe undo acl ipv6 all command deletes all types of ACLs on a device. If the ACLs being deleted are applied to services, these services are interrupted. Before deleting an ACL6, ensure that the ACL6 is not referenced by services.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the rule command to configure a rule for a created ACL6. Then the ACL6 rule can be applied to match packets.\nRun the description command to configure a description for a created ACL6. The description can contain the functions of the ACL6, facilitating applications."
