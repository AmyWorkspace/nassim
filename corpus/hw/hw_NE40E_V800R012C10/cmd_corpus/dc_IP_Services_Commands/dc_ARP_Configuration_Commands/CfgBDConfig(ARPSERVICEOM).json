    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter receiving an ARP request packet, the device broadcasts the packet in its broadcast domain. If the device receives a large number of ARP request packets in a short period of time and broadcasts the packets, excessive ARP request packets are forwarded in the broadcast domain. As a result, the bandwidth is wasted, and traffic congestion may occur.\nTo resolve this problem, run the arp l2-proxy enable command to enable Layer 2 proxy ARP on the device. After receiving an ARP request packet, the device checks whether the destination IP address in the packet matches an ARP entry. If a matching ARP entry is found, the device sends an ARP reply packet with the MAC address of the destination. If no matching ARP entry is found, the device discards the packet."
