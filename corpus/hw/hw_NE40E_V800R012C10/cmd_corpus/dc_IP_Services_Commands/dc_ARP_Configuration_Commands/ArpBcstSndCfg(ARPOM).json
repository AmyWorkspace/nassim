    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nARP broadcast packets delivered from the sub-interface are replicated to all VLANs. If the number of VLANs is 100 and the number of ARP broadcast packets sent per second is 50, the number of ARP broadcast packets replicated is 5000 (100 x 50). This may cause the peer device to be overloaded with ARP packets. As a result, the downstream device becomes abnormal. When replicating a large number of ARP broadcast packets, the local device may fail to send ARP packets promptly, causing ARP learning failures. In this case, you can set a proper rate for sending ARP broadcast packets to reduce CPU usage.\nPrecautions\nIn real-world situations, after a rate at which ARP broadcast packets are sent is configured on a device, the total number of ARP broadcast packets sent by the device is related to board performance."
