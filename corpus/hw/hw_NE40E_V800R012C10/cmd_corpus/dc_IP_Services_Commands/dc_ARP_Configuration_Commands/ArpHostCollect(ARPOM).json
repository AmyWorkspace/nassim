    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen tenants communicate with each other for the first time, they send ARP requests. These ARP requests are broadcast on Layer 2 networks and may cause a broadcast storm. To prevent this problem, you can enable ARP broadcast suppression on Layer 2 VXLAN gateways. However, ARP broadcast suppression is implemented based on the host information table (including host IP addresses, MAC addresses, VTEP addresses, and VNI IDs) on Layer 3 gateways.\nTo enable a Layer 2 gateway to obtain the host information table, run the arp collect host enable command in the VBDIF interface view. After the command is run, the host information is advertised to a remote device through BGP EVPN routes."
