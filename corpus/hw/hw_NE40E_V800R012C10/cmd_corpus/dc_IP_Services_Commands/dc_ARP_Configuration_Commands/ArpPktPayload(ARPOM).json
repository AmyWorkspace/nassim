    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen different devices are interconnected, the payload lengths of ARP packets to be sent are different on these devices. As a result, ARP negotiation fails and in turn ARP entries cannot be learned. To prevent this issue, you can configure the same payload length for ARP packets to be sent on the interconnected devices."
