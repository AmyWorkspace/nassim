    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the peer device does not respond to an ARP request, the ARP fast reply function must be disabled in the corresponding slot.\nTo protect a device against ARP request packet attacks and reduce CPU resource consumption, run the arp fast-reply enable command.\nAfter a device on which the ARP fast reply function is enabled receives an ARP request packet that requests the MAC address of a local interface, if the local interface has learned the peer ARP information, the system does not send the ARP request packet to the CPU but replies using hardware; if the local interface has not learned the peer ARP information, the system sends the ARP request packet to the CPU.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
