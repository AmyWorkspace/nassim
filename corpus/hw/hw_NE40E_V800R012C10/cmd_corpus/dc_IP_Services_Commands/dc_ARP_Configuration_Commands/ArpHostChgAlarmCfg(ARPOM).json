    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure host IP address conflict check options, run the arp host ip-conflict-check command. The system counts the number of IP address conflicts in ARP entries learned between the local and remote ends or between different local interfaces. If the number of IP address conflicts is greater than or equal to the configured threshold for IP address conflicts within a specified period, the system reports a host IP address conflict alarm.If no IP address conflict occurs on the host that reports a host IP address conflict alarm for 10 consecutive minutes, the alarm is cleared."
