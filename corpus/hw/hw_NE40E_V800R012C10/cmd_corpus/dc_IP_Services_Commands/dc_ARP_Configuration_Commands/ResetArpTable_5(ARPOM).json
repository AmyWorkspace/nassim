    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an unauthorized user sends a large number of ARP messages to a device, the device learns a large number of ARP entries in a short period of time, causing a buffer overflow. As a result, users may fail to access the network. To resolve the problem, run the reset arp command to delete invalid ARP entries so that new ARP entries can be created to allow authorized user access.\nPrerequisites\nARP entries exist on a device.\nThe board specified by slot slot-id exists if this parameter is configured.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter an ARP entry is cleared, the mapping between the IP and MAC addresses in the entry is cleared. As a result, users may fail to access the network, and services may be interrupted."
