    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nWhen two hosts reside on different network segments and do not have default gateways configured, run this command on the device that connects to the two hosts to enable routed proxy ARP. This configuration implements IP address resolution between the two hosts.\n\nPrecautions\n\nThe network IDs in the IP addresses of hosts on each subnet must be the same. The hosts do not need to have default gateways configured.\nThe routes supported by routed proxy ARP include common IPv4 routes and VXLAN routes."
