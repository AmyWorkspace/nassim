    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a device is enabled to send ARP packets at a constant rate, the device sends 5 ARP packets every 10 ms by default. To adjust the constant rate, run the arp constant-send maximum command. A proper constant rate can help prevent services from being affected on the peer device.\nPrerequisites\nThe arp constant-send enable command has been run to enable the device to send ARP packets at a constant rate.\nPrecautions\nThe default setting is recommended."
