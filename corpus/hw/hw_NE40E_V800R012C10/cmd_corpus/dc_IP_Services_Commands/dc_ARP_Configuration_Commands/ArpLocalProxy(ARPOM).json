    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the EVC model, a BD is a broadcast domain, and interfaces in a BD broadcast their received packets. To minimize the broadcast volume, network administrators generally run the split-horizon enable command on interfaces that do not need to communicate with each other to isolate users. However, as user services are increasing, users have a growing requirement for communication. To meet the requirement, run the arp-proxy local enable command on a VBDIF interface to enable local proxy ARP so that isolated users in a BD can communicate with each other.\nPrerequisites\nA VBDIF interface has been created and the VBDIF interface view is displayed using the interface vbdif command.\nPrecautions\nAfter local proxy ARP is enabled, all interfaces in a BD can communicate with each other. If you want to enable only some interfaces in a BD to communicate, run the undo split-horizon enable command only on the interfaces that have the communication requirement."
