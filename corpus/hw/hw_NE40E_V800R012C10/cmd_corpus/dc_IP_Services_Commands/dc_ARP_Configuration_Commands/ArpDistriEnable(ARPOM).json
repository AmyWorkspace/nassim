    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure a gateway to function as a distributed gateway and learn only the ARP packets sent by the user-side host, run the\narp distribute-gateway enable command to enable the distributed gateway function. After this function is enabled:\nThe gateway processes only ARP packets sent by user-side interfaces and advertises host routes.The gateway deletes the ARP packets sent by network-side interfaces as well as the associated host routes.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the distribution gateway function is enabled:\nStatic ARP entries on the network side fail to be configured on the gateway.If multiple gateways have the same IP address, after this command is run to enable the distributed gateway function on a gateway, this gateway does not report an ARP conflict."
