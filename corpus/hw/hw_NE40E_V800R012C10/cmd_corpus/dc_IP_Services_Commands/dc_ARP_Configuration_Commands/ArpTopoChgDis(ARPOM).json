With this configuration, the device does not age or delete Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) entries after receiving a TC packet.\nThe undo arp topology-change disable command enables the device to respond to TC packets.\nBy default, the device responds to TC packets.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, after a loop-prevention protocol detects a network topology change, it will send a protocol packet to instruct the device to age or delete ARP entries. Then the device will re-learn ARP entries.\nHowever, if the network topology changes frequently or a device has a large number of ARP entries, re-learning of ARP entries causes ARP entry flooding, which consumes network resources and affects other services on the device. To resolve this problem, run the arp topology-change disable command to disable the device from responding to TC packets.\nPrecautions\nAfter the arp topology-change disable command is run, the device will not age or delete ARP entries. Therefore, if an ARP entry does not contain the latest information about a peer device, services will be interrupted between the local and peer devices."
