    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, a device broadcasts ARP aging probe and Miss messages at varied rates. If the number of ARP packets received by the peer device exceeds its processing capability, packets may be lost and services may be affected. To resolve the problem, run the arp constant-send enable command to enable the device to send ARP packets at a constant rate. Then, run the arp constant-send maximum command to set a proper constant rate as needed."
