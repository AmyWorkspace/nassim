    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prevent address conflicts due to repetitive IP address assignment, run the dhcp server ping command to configure the maximum number of ping packets that a DHCP server sends and the maximum timeout period of each ping reply. If no ping reply is received within a specified detection period, the DHCP server continues sending ping packets until the number of ping packets reaches the threshold. If still no ping reply is received, the DHCP server considers that this IP address can be assigned to a DHCP client as no device in the network segment is using this IP address. In this manner, the IP addresses sent to DHCP clients are unique.\nPrerequisites\nThe DHCP function has been enabled using the dhcp enable command."
