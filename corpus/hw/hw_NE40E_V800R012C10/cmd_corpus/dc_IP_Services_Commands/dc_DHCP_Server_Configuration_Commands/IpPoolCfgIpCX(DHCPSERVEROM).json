    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore a host accesses the Internet, the DNS server needs to be used to resolve a domain name to an IP address. To allow a DHCP client to properly access the Internet, run the dns-server command to configure the IP address of a DHCP server so that the DHCP server can send DNS server addresses to DHCP clients through Option 6.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of eight NetBIOS server addresses can be specified for each address pool.\nIf DNS server addresses have been configured in an address pool, running the dns-server command adds new DNS server addresses but does not delete the configured ones. To delete the configured ones, run the undo dns-server command.\nAn earlier configured ip-address has a higher priority. The IP address with the highest priority is used as the primary address, and the other seven IP addresses are used as secondary addresses."
