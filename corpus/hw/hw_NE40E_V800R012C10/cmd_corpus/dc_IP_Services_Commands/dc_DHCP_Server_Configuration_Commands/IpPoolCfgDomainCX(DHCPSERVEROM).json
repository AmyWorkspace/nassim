    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEvery DHCP client has its own domain name. To allow communication between DHCP clients through domain names and avoid IP address conflicts during domain name resolution, run the dns-suffix command to configure a DNS domain name suffix. The DHCP server sends the DNS domain name to DHCP clients through Option 15 during IP address assignment. DHCP clients then add a suffix to the DNS domain name for resolution.\nPrecautions\nIf no domain name suffix is configured for a DHCP client in an address pool, the DHCP server fails to send the domain name suffix to the DHCP client, and the DHCP client fails to communicate with the DHCP server."
