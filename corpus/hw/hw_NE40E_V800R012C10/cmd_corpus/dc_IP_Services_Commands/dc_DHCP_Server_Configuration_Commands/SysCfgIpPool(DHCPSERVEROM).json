    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo create an address pool, run the ip pool command to configure address pool parameters, such as the gateway address, address pool lease, and VPN instance. Such an address pool can be used for the DHCP server to assign IP addresses.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter an address pool is created, run the section command in the IP address pool view to specify the network segment in which the IP address can be assigned from the address pool.\nPrecautions\nIf an IP address in a global address pool is being used, the global address pool cannot be deleted.\nIf users go online through an unnumbered interface, user access from a local server address pool is not supported."
