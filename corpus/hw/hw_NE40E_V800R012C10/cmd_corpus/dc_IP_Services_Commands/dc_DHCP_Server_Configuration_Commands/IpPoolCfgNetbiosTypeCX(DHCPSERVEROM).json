    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a DHCP client uses NetBIOS to communicate with the DHCP server, mapping between host names and IP addresses needs to be established. Based on the method of obtaining the mapping, NetBIOS nodes can be classified as b node, p node, m node, and h node. To configure the NetBIOS node type for a DHCP client, run the netbios-type command. The DHCP server sends the NetBIOS node type to a DHCP client along with IP address assignment.\nPrecautions\nIf no NetBIOS node type is specified on the DHCP server, the p node is used by default."
