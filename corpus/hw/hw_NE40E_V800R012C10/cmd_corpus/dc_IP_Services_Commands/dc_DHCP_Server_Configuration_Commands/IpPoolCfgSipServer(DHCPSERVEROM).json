To allow a DHCP client to access the SIP server, run the sip-server command on the DHCP server to configure the SIP server address of an address pool. After that, the DHCP server notifies the DHCP client of the SIP server address through Option 120 during address assignment.\nPrerequisites\nA SIP server already exists.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of two SIP servers can be configured in an address pool."
