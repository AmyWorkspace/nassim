    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf no relay exists between a DHCP client and the DHCP server, the DHCP server assigns IP addresses from different network segments and VPNs based on the Option 60 information carried in a user request sent by the DHCP client. To enable the DHCP server to assign IP addresses based on Option 60, run the dhcp server base-option60 enable command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the client-option60 command in the DHCP server address pool view to configure the Option 60 information. If the configuration matches the Option 60 information carried in the user request sent by a DHCP client, the DHCP server assigns an IP address from the address pool to the DHCP client."
