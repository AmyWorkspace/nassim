    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the option router disable command is executed for network security purposes, the DHCP server does not send a gateway address to DHCP clients any more. To ensure that the DHCP clients can access some application servers, run the option33 route command to configure a user route. The DHCP server can send the user route to DHCP clients through Option 33, and DHCP clients can obtain the route towards the target network using Option 33.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of eight user routes can be configured in an address pool."
