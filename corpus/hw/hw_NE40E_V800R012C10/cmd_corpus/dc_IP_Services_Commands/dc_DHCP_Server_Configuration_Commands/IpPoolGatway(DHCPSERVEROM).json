    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allow IP address assignment from an address pool, run the gateway command to configure a gateway address and a subnet mask for the address pool. If a DHCP client requests an IP address from the DHCP server, the DHCP server notifies the client of the gateway address and subnet mask using Option 3 and Option 1.\nPrecautions\nA gateway address can be included only in an address segment on the local address pool."
