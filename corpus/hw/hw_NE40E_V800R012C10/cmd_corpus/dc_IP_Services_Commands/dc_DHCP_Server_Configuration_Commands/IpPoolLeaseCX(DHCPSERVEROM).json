    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe IP address lease for a host varies according to client requirements. Some hosts, such as the DNS server, need to be used for a long term. To configure the IP address lease to unlimited for such hosts, Some hosts, such as a laptop, are used temporarily. To configure an IP address lease for such hosts, run the lease command with a lease specified. After the lease time elapses, the DHCP server reclaims the IP address so that the IP address can be assigned to another DHCP client.\nPrecautions\nA DHCP server can assign a specific lease to IP addresses in each address pool. All addresses in the same address pool must have the same lease."
