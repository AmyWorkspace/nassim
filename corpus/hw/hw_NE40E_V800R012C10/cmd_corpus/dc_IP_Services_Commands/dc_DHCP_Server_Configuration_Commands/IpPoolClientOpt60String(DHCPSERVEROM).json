    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen no relay exists between the DHCP server and DHCP clients, run the client-option60 command to configure the DHCP server to assign IP addresses to DHCP clients in different network segments or VPNs based on the Option 60 information. If the option60-text parameter configured for a server address pool matches the Option 60 information carried in the packets sent by DHCP clients, the DHCP server assigns IP addresses from the address pool. Otherwise, the DHCP server assigns IP addresses based on the gateway address.\nPrecautions\nBefore this command is executed, run the dhcp server base-option60 enable command in the system view to enable the DHCP server to assign IP addresses based on Option 60."
