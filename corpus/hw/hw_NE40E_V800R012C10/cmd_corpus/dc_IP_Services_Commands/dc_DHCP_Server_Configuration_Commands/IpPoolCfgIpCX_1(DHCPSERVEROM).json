    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFor Microsoft DHCP clients, the NetBIOS Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) server name needs to be used to resolve a domain name to an IP address. To allow normal communication, run the netbios-name-server command to configure the NetBIOS server address of an address pool. During IP address assignment, the DHCP server notifies DHCP clients of NetBIOS server addresses through Option 44.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of eight NetBIOS server addresses can be specified for each address pool.\nAn earlier configured ip-address has a higher priority. The IP address with the highest priority is used as the primary address, and the other seven IP addresses are used as secondary addresses."
