    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve device performance and prevent attacks, set a proper reassembly timeout period to ensure that IPv4 fragments that have waited for reassembly for a long time are aged in time.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf time is set too long, it is probable that a large number of fragments are stored on the device, waiting to be reassembled. This wastes resources, reduces device performance, and may cause network attacks. Therefore, you are not recommended to set time too long.\nPrecautions\nPacket fragmentation is performed on outbound interfaces, and inbound interfaces do not fragment packets."
