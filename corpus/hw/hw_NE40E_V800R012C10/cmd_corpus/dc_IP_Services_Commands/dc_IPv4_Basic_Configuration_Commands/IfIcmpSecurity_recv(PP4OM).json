    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIn normal situations, the system can properly receive ICMP packets. In case of heavy network traffic, if hosts or ports are frequently unreachable, routers receive a large number of ICMP packets, which causes heavy traffic burden and performance deterioration. In addition, network attackers often use ICMP error packets to spy on the internal structure of the network.\nTo improve network performance and security, run the undo icmp receive command to disable the system from receiving ICMP packets of a specified type.\n\nPrecautions\n\nIn normal network conditions, you can run the icmp receive command to restore the function to receive ICMP packets."
