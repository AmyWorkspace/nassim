    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a SYN packet is sent, TCP enables the SYN-Wait timer. If no response packet is received before SYN-Wait is timeout, the TCP connection is terminated.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe SYN-Wait timer starts when an SYN packet is sent. A TCP connection is torn down if no response packet is received before the SYN-Wait timer expires.\nPrecautions\nIf this command is configured for several times in the same view, only the last configuration takes effect.\nYou are recommended to configure the parameters under the guidance of the technical personnel."
