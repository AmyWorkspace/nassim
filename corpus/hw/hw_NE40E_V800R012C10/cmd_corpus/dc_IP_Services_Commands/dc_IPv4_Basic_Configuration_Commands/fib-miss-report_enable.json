    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter an interface is enabled to send FibMiss packets to the interface board's CPU, the interface sends a FibMiss packet to the interface board's CPU of the interface board after receiving an IP packet that is not destined for the local device and does not match any FIB entry. The CPU parses the source IP address of this packet only after it receives a FibMiss packet. If the icmp host-unreachable send command has been run on the device, the device will send an IPv4 ICMP host unreachable packet to its remote device.\nFor information about fundamentals, see Configuration Guide > IP Service > Basic IPv4 Configuration > Enabling the Sending of FibMiss Packets to the Interface Board's CPU.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe fib-miss-report enable command takes effect for all interface boards."
