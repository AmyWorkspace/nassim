    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nStandard protocols define the IP source address scope as follows:\n\nBroadcast addresses of Class A through Class C cannot be used as the source address.\nClass D addresses, which are used for IP multicasting, cannot be used as the source address.\nClass E addresses are reserved for experimental use and therefore cannot be used as the source address.\nAll Fs addresses cannot be used as the source address.\nThe address on network 127 cannot be used as the source address on the network outside the host.\n\nIn actual situations, these addresses may still be used as the source address. For example, Class A through Class C addresses may have a 32-bit mask, and the broadcast addresses of class A through E are available. By default, the source address filtering function is disabled.\nIf a user discovers that a device has encountered a malicious packet attack with the source address as a broadcast or multicast address, run the ip verify source-address command to filter this type of address in packets in order to improve device security."
