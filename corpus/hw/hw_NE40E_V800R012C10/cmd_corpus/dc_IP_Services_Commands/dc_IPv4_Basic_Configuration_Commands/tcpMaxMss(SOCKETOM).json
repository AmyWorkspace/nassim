    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo establish a TCP connection, the MSS value is negotiated, which indicates the maximum length of packets that the local device can receive. This length is the TCP payload length, excluding that of the TCP header. If the path MTU is unavailable on one end of a TCP connection, this end cannot adjust the TCP packet size based on the MTU. As a result, this end may send TCP packets that are longer than the MTUs on intermediate devices, which will discard these packets. To prevent this problem, run the tcp max-mss command on either end of a TCP connection to set the maximum MSS value of TCP packets. Then the MSS value negotiated by both ends will not exceed this maximum MSS value, and accordingly TCP packets sent from both ends will not be longer than this maximum MSS value and can travel through the intermediate network.\nPrecautions\nThe maximum MSS value configured using the tcp max-mss command must be larger than the minimum MSS value (216) supported by the system. If the configured MSS value is less than 216, 216 is used."
