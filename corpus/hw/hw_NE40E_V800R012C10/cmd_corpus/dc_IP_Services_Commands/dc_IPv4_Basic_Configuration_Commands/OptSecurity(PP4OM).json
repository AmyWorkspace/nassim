    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIP packets can carry the following route options:\nRoute-alertRoute-recordSource-routeTime-stamp\nGenerally, these options are used for diagnosing network paths and temporarily transmitting special services. These options, however, may be used by attackers to spy on the network structure for initiating attacks. Therefore, you need to run the ip option enable command to enable the system to process IP packets with route options or run the undo ip option enable command to disable the system from processing IP packets with route options.\nBy default, the system processes IP packets with route options. To prevent attacks that make use of IP packets with route options, disable the system from processing IP packets with route options.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the system is disabled from processing IP packets with route options, the system collects only statistics about discarded packets.\nPrecautions\nIf the network status is normal and the system is required to process IP packets with route options, run the ip option enable command.\nRoute priorities configured in the interface view take precedence over those configured in the system view.\nThe execution of the undo ip option enable command may affect the CPU processing of IP packets that carry the corresponding routing entries. For example, after the undo ip option route-alert enable command is run, the CPU processing of RSVP-TE packets is affected."
