    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the network volume is large, the device under a heavy load delays sending ICMP reply packets. The icmp-reply fast command can be used to enable fast ICMP reply on the device to shorten the delay in sending ICMP reply packets.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter fast ICMP reply is disabled on a device, the device does not respond to the ICMP echo packet with the destination address being the local device address.\nEnabling fast ICMP reply has the following impacts:\nICMP packet sampling cannot be performed.Statistics on ICMP packets cannot be collected.\nWhen ICMP packet sampling is configured, fast ICMP reply must be disabled.\n\nPrecautions\nFast ICMP reply takes effect only when being enabled in both system and slot views.\nRunning the undo icmp-reply fast command in the system or slot view disables fast ICMP reply.\nThe fast reply function is enabled by default. Therefore, the display icmp statistics command cannot be used to collect statistics on ICMP fast reply packets on the responder.\nThe fast reply function does not take effect for fragment ICMP packets.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
