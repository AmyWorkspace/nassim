    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn normal situations, the system can properly send ICMP packets. In case of heavy network traffic, if hosts or ports are frequently unreachable, routers send a large number of ICMP packets, which causes heavy traffic burden and performance deterioration. In addition, network attackers often use ICMP error packets to spy on the internal structure of the network.\nTo improve network performance and security, run the undo icmp send command to disable the system from sending ICMP packets of a specified type.\nIf you want to restore the default configuration and the display this command output does not contain the icmp send or undo icmp send command configuration, run the clear icmp send command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the system is disabled from sending ICMP packets, the system collects only statistics about discarded packets.\nPrecautions\nIn normal network conditions, you can run the icmp send command to send ICMP packets. The standard protocol does not require that routers must send host unreachable packets as a reply when the network or host is unreachable. Currently, the router sends network unreachable packets as a reply when it receives a packet and cannot find the routing table.\nIn FIB Miss scenarios, a device replies with network unreachable packets by default. In ARP Miss scenarios, a device does not respond by default but triggers ARP learning."
