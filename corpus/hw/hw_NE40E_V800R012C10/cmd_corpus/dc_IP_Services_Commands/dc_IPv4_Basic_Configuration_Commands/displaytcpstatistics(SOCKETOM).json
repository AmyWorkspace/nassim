    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo check statistics about TCP packets, including the number of sent and received TCP packets, run the display tcp statistics command.\nThe following fields in the command output can be used to determine the network connectivity:\nEstablished connections: This field helps you determine whether the number of connections exceeds the upper limit so you can continue to deploy services such as BGP services or adjust the load.Duplicate ACK packets: This field helps you determine whether the device is attacked by unknown ACK packets. If a device receives a large number of unknown ACK packets, it is probably being attacked.Out-of-order packets: This field helps you determine the network quality. If the network quality is poor, a lot of out-of-order packets are generated.\nIf you want to diagnose problems and monitor information of specific applications, configure verbose in the display tcp statistics command so that application-specific TCP packet statistics are displayed. The applications can be BGP, FTP, LDP, MSDP, Telnet, SSH, and others.\n\nPrecautions\nThe number of packets received by the router includes the number of forwarded packets, packets sent to the upper layer, and discarded packets.\nThe application is identified by a port number. The BGP port number is 179; the FTP port number is 20 or 21; the LDP port number is 646; the MSDP port number is 639; the Telnet port number is 23; the SSH port number is 22. The traffic statistics of other applications are displayed in the Others field.\nBefore collecting the IPv6 TCP packet statistics during a specific period, you are recommended to run the reset tcp ipv6 statistics command to clear the previous IPv6 TCP packet statistics."
