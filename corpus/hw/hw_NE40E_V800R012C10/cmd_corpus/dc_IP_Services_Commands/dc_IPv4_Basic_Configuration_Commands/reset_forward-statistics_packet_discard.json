    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDuring maintenance and fault locating, to collect accurate statistics about discarded packets within a specified period, run the reset forward-statistics packet discard command to clear the existing statistics. This configuration allows for a new round of statistics collection.\nConfiguration Impact\nStatistics about discarded packets cannot be restored after they are cleared. Therefore, exercise caution when you run the reset forward-statistics packet discard command."
