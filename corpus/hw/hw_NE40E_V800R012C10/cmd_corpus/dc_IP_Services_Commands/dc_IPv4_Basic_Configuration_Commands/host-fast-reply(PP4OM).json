    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a sub-interface on the local device has been configured with a VLAN priority for host packets using the 8021p <8021p-value> command, a sub-interface on the peer device has been configured with the same VLAN priority and a VLAN ID using the dot1q termination vid 8021p { <8021p-value1> [ to <8021p-value2> ] } &<1-8> command, and the IP addresses of the two sub-interfaces are on the same network segment, the local and peer devices fail to communicate with each other and the BGP peer relationship fails to be established between the local and peer devices. To disable fast reply of host packets based on the service type configured on the interface, run the host-packet fast-reply disable command."
