    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a TCP path MTU option is set, the TCP connection detects the MTU of the forwarding path and send packets according to the MTU. You can configure an aging time for the TCP path MTU so that the TCP connection redetects the MTU after the aging time expires. If no aging time is configured, the detected TCP path MTU never ages.\nConfiguration Impact\nRunning the tcp timer pathmtu-age command changes the aging time of dynamic PMTUs only, not static PMTUs. Static PMTUs never age.\nPrecautions\nA PMTU needs to be set based on the real world situation, such as network stability. The default PMTU is recommended. That is, a PMTU does not age.\nIf the aging time of a PMTU is set to be too longer, the PMTU may not be updated in time. This will affect network performance.If the aging time of a PMTU is set to be too short, data transmission efficiency on the network will be affected."
