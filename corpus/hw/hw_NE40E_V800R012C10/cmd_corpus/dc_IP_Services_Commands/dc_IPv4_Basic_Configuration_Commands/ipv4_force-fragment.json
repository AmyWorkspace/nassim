    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, forced IPv4 packet fragmentation is not enabled. When the length of an IPv4 packet received by an interface on the device is greater than the MTU of the interface and the DF flag in the IPv4 packet is set to 1, the device will discard this packet and send an ICMP packet to its upstream device. If forced IPv4 packet fragmentation is enabled on the device, the device will fragment the packet before sending it.\nWhen the device is connected to a device with a small interface forwarding capacity, configure forced IPv4 packet fragmentation on the NE40E to prevent long packets from being discarded.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
