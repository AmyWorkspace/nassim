    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo view statistics about the sent and received IPv6 packets, run the display ipv6 statistics command.\nDuring transmission of IPv6 packets, when the source end implements fragmentation on IPv6 packets, run the display ipv6 statistics command to view the number of successfully fragmented IPv6 packets and the total number of sent fragmented packets. On the destination end, this command also displays whether the number of received fragmented packets is correct. The incorrect packets are discarded and the number of discarded packets is increased correspondingly.\nPrecautions\nThe packets received by a router include the forwarded packets, the packets transmitted to the upper layer, and the discarded packets."
