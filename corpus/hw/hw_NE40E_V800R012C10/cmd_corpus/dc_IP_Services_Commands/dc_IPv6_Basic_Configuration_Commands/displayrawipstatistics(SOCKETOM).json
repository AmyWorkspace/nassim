    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo check statistics about RawIP packets, including the number of sent and received RawIP packets, run the display rawip statistics command.\nRSVP, OSPF, and ICMP packets are encapsulated into RawIP packets during transmission. During ping operations, for example, run the display rawip statistics command to check the number of RawIP packets sent by the local device to see if the network abnormality is caused by abnormal sending and receiving of RawIP packets.\nIf you want to diagnose problems and monitor information of specific applications, configure verbose in the display rawip statistics command so that application-specific RawIP packet statistics are displayed. The applications can be ICMP, OSPF, RSVP, or others.\nPrecautions\nThe number of packets received by the router includes the number of forwarded packets, packets sent to the upper layer, and discarded packets."
