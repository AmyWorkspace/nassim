    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve device performance and prevent attacks, run the ipv6 reassembling timeout command to set a proper reassembly timeout period for IPv6 fragments so that IPv6 fragments that have waited for reassembly for a long time are promptly aged.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a long reassembly timeout period is set, a large number of IPv6 fragments are stored on the device, waiting to be reassembled. This consumes resources, reduces device performance, and may cause network attacks. Therefore, you are not recommended to set a long reassembly timeout period"
