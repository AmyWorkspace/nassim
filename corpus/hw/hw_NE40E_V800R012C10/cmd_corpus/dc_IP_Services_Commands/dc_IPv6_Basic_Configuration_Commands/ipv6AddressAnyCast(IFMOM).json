    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn anycast address is used to identify a group of interfaces that are configured on different nodes. The packets that are sent to an anycast address are transmitted to an interface that is in the interface group identified by the anycast address and is closest to the source node. (The distance between an interface and the source node is calculated based on a routing protocol).\nWhen the 6to4 tunnel is used for communication between the 6to4 network and the native IPv6 network, you can configure an anycast address whose prefix is 2002:c058:6301/48 on the tunnel interface of the 6to4 relay router. If an anycast address is used, you need to configure the same address for the tunnel interfaces of all devices. In this manner, the number of addresses is reduced.\nPrerequisites\nBefore running this command, run the ipv6 enable command on the interface view to enable the IPv6 function of the tunnel interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the undo command is run, if no parameter is specified, all IPv6 addresses (including anycast addresses but excluding the link-local address that is configured automatically) are deleted.\nPrecautions\nAn anycast address cannot be used as a source address. Therefore, when a device is used to send packets, a global unicast address is configured for the device.\nAn anycast address is not necessarily a subnet-router anycast address and can be a global unicast address configured using the ipv6 address anycast command.\nAn interface can be configured with a maximum of 64 anycast IPv6 addresses."
