    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo reduce exposure of the IPv6 addresses of device interfaces in order to prevent against detection through ICMPv6 Port Unreachable or Time Exceeded messages, run the ipv6 icmp source-address command to specify the source IPv6 address of ICMPv6 Port Unreachable or Time Exceeded messages. After this command is run, if the device needs to give a reply to the messages, the device uses the IPv6 address of the loopback interface as the source IPv6 address of ICMPv6 Port Unreachable or Time Exceeded messages.\nPrecautions\nThis command can be configured only on one loopback interface in a VPN."
