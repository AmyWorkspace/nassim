    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo establish a TCP6 connection, the MSS value is negotiated, which indicates the maximum length of packets that the local device can receive. If the path MTU is unavailable on one end of a TCP6 connection, this end cannot adjust the TCP6 packet size based on the MTU. As a result, this end may send TCP6 packets that are longer than the MTUs on intermediate devices, which will discard these packets. To prevent this problem, run the tcp ipv6 max-mss command on either end of a TCP6 connection to set the maximum MSS value of TCP6 packets. Then the MSS value negotiated by both ends will not exceed this maximum MSS value, and accordingly TCP6 packets sent from both ends will not be longer than this maximum MSS value and can travel through the intermediate network."
