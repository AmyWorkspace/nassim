    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can change the lifetime of a PMTU by setting an aging time for the PMTU.\nIf you want to slow down PMTU aging, run the ipv6 pathmtu age command to change the aging time of the PMTU to a larger value.\nConfiguration Impact\nThis command can be used to change only the aging time of dynamic PMTUs. It is not applicable to static PMTUs because static PMTUs cannot age.\nPrecautions\nThe priority of a static PMTU is higher than that of a dynamic PMTU. If the static PMTU exists, the dynamic PMTU does not take effect.\nThe aging time for the PMTU is valid only for the dynamic PMTU entries generated after this configuration, instead of the PMTU entries generated before this configuration."
