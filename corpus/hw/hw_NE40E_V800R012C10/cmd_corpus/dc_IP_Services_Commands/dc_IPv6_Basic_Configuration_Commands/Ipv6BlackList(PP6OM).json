    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter an ACL is configured for services (for example, the snmp-agent acl command is configured for SNMP or the telnet ipv6 server acl command is configured for Telnet), If TCP6 or UDP6 packets are denied by a configured ACL6, the ipv6 blacklist packet permit command and its undo format can be used to control the system whether to reply with packets to the source end.\nRunning the ipv6 blacklist packet permit command enables the system to reply with packets to the source end.Running the undo ipv6 blacklist packet permit command disables the system from replying with packets to the source end.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the ipv6 blacklist packet permit command is run, the system will reply with specific packets to the source end based on the type of the packets denied by the system.\nIf the denied packets are TCP6 packets, the system will reply with TCP-RST packets to the source end.If the denied packets are UDP6 packets, the system will reply with PORT-UNREACHABLE packets to the source end."
