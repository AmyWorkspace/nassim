    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can perform other IPv6 configurations on an interface only when IPv6 is enabled in the interface view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the IPv6 function is disabled on the interface, the IPv6 addresses of the interface are deleted and IPv6-related commands no longer can be configured on the interface.\nFollow-up Procedure\nPerform IPv6-related configurations, including configuring IPv6 addresses and ND-related parameters (M flag, O flag, RA halt flag, interval for sending RA messages, lifetime of RA messages, interval for sending NS messages, DAD times, time period during which the IPv6 neighbor keeps reachable, prefix carried in the RA message, and static ND entries).\nPrecautions\nAfter you disable IPv6 on an interface, IPv6-related configurations are removed. For example, IS-IS IPv6 and RIPng are disabled on the interface, that is, the isis ipv6 enable and ripng enable commands become ineffective."
