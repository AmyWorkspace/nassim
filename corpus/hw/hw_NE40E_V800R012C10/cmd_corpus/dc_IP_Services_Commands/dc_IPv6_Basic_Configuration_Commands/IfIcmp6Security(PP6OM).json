    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a normal network, a device can correctly send or receive ICMPv6 messages; however, when network traffic load is heavy, host unreachable or port unreachable events frequently occur and routers need to send a large number of ICMPv6 messages, which burdens the network and degrades the performance of the routers. In addition, attackers usually use ICMPv6 error messages to probe the internal network topology illegitimately.To improve network performance and security, you need to run the undo ipv6 icmp send command to disable the system from sending ICMPv6 Echo-Reply messages, Host -Unreachable messages, and Port-Unreachable messages.\nIf you want to restore the default configuration and the display this command output does not contain the ipv6 icmp send or undo ipv6 icmp send command configuration, run the clear icmp send command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the system is disabled from sending ICMPv6 Echo-Reply messages, Host -Unreachable messages, and Port-Unreachable messages, the system counts only the number of discarded messages instead of the number of sent Echo-Reply messages, Host -Unreachable messages, and Port-Unreachable messages.\nPrecautions\nWhen the network becomes normal again, you can run the undo ipv6 icmp send command to re-enable the system to process ICMPv6 messages."
