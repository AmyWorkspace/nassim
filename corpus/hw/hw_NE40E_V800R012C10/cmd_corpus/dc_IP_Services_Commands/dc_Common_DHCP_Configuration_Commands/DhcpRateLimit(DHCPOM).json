    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a large number of DHCP clients go online directly, a large number of DHCP clients go online through a DHCP relay agent, or the DHCP relay agent or DHCP server is busy due to message attacks, run the dhcp rate-limit command to set a rate limit for DHCP messages. If the rate of DHCP messages exceeds the limit, some DHCP messages are discarded, reducing CPU usage and increasing the user access rate. The rate limit for DHCP messages can be adjusted based on network conditions.\nIf you do not need to limit the rate of DHCP messages, run the dhcp rate-limit disable command to disable global rate limiting for DHCP messages."
