    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nSome DHCP clients use a fixed IP address for a long time, and some DHCP clients use a temporary IP address. After a DHCP client's lease time configured using the lease command is expired, the DHCP server reclaims the IP address of the DHCP client and allocates this IP address to another DHCP client.\nTo configure the expected lease time for a DHCP client, run the dhcp client expected-lease command. While assigning an address lease time, the DHCP server compares the expected lease time with the address lease time of the current address pool and provides the DHCP client an appropriate lease time based on address assignment rules."
