    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nWhen a DHCP client applies to a DHCP server for an IP address, the DHCP client sends DHCP messages carrying Option 60. To configure the Option 60 information carried in the DHCP messages, run the dhcpc option60 redefined command. The DHCP server identifies different DHCP clients for differentiated processing based on the Option 60 information in received DHCP messages.\n\nPrecautions\n\nIf the Option 60 information is configured in both the system view and interface view, the configuration in the interface view takes effect.\nIf the Option 60 information is not configured in either the interface view or system view, the Option 60 information carried in the DHCP messages sent by a DHCP client is HUAWEI device model information."
