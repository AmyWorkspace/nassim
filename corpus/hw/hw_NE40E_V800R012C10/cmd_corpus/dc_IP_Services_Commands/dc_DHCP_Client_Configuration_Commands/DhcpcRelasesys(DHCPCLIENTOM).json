    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a DHCP client no longer uses the assigned IP address, run the dhcp release command so that the DHCP client proactively sends a DHCP Release packet to the DHCP server to notify the DHCP server of releasing the lease of the IP address. If this command is run in the system view, the IP addresses requested by all interfaces from the DHCP server are released. If this command is run in the interface view, only the IP address requested by the specific interface from the DHCP server is released."
