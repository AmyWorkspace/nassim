    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe MPLS P node performs a hash operation for packets with only the L2 Ethernet header carried between the MPLS label stack and IP header (for example, VPLS packets) based on the IP quintuple/triplet. When the payload is not Ethernet header+IP header, for example, the payload is the Ethernet header or TDM/ATM header, packets with MPLS label stack+control word+payload may be incorrectly identified as packets with MPLS label stack+Ethernet header+IP header for load balancing. After this command is run, a hash operation is performed for packets with only the L2 Ethernet header carried between the MPLS label stack and IP header (for example, VPLS packets) based on all MPLS labels to prevent incorrect identification."
