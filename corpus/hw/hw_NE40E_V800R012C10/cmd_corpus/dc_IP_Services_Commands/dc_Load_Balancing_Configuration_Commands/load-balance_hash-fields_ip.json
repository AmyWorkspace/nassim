    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command is used to specify the hash factors that are used for traffic load balancing at the device in IP forwarding.\nThe load balancing function is implemented using the hash algorithm on the upstream interface board. Traffic is hashed based on traffic characteristics, which are called hash factors. If hash factors are more hashable, traffic will be more evenly load-balanced. The device has default values of the hash factors used for load balancing of different service types of packets. Traffic is load balanced based on the default hash factors depending on the service types of packets on the upstream interface board. To implement load balancing better, configure hash factors based on traffic types.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe load-balance hash-fields ip command is cyclic in nature, and only the latest configuration takes effect. After the command is configured, the hash calculation is performed based on the new hash factors.\nFollow-up Procedure\nThe dynamic load balancing adjustment function configured using the load-balance dynamic-adjust enable command does not take effect for tunnel interfaces with service classes configured.\nThis command applies only to the LPUF-50/LPUF-50-L/LPUI-21-L/LPUI-51-L/LPUF-51/LPUF-51-B/LPUI-51/LPUI-51-B/LPUI-51-S/LPUS-51/LPUF-101/LPUF-101-B/LPUI-101/LPUI-101-B/LPUS-101/LPUF-51-E/LPUI-51-E/LPUI-51-CM/LPUF-120/LPUF-120-B/LPUF-120-E/LPUI-102-E/LPUI-120/LPUI-120-B/LPUI-120-L/LPUI-52-E/LPUI-120-E/LPUI-120-CM/LPUF-240/LPUF-240-B/LPUF-240-E/LPUI-240/LPUI-240-B/LPUI-240-CM/LPUI-240-L/LPUF-480/LPUF-480-B/LPUI-480/LPUI-480-B/LPUI-480-L/LPUF-480-E/LPUI-480-CM/LPUI-200/LPUI-200-L/LPUF-200/LPUF-200-B/LPUI-1T/LPUI-1T-B/LPUI-1T-L/LPUI-1T-CM/LPUI-2T/LPUI-2T-B/LPUI-2T-CM/LPUF-481/LPUF-402-E/LPUI-241/LPUI-241-B/LPUI-241-CM//LPUF-241/LPUF-241-E/LPUF-52/LPUF-1T-E/LPUI-1T-CM/LPUF-1T-L.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
