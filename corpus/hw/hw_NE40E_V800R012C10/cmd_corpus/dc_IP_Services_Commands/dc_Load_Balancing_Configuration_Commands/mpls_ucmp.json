    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf UCMP s enabled and the MPLS P nodes (excluding BGP P nodes) have multiple outbound interfaces, UCMP is performed among the outbound interfaces based on bandwidth weights. If UCMP is disabled and the MPLS P nodes (excluding BGP P nodes) have multiple outbound interfaces, equal-cost multipath (ECMP) is performed among the outbound interfaces. To enable UCMP for MPLS P nodes (excluding BGP P nodes), run the load-balance mpls unequal-cost enable command.\nPrecautions\nIn CBTS/TE group scenarios, if some tunnels are not configured with a weight, flows with different priorities are forwarded on the associated tunnel through equal-cost routes.\nIf the CBTS/TE group is configured and this command is run simultaneously, the CBTS/TE group takes effect preferentially, and UCMP does not take effect."
