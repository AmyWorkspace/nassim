    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command is used to specify the hash factors that are used for traffic load balancing at the AC end of the PE in VPLS or common Layer 2 forwarding.\nThe load balancing function is implemented using the hash algorithm on the upstream interface board. Traffic is hashed based on traffic characteristics, which are called hash factors. If hash factors are more hashable, traffic will be more evenly load-balanced. The device has default values of the hash factors used for load balancing of different service types of packets. Traffic is load balanced based on the default hash factors depending on the service types of packets on the upstream interface board. To implement load balancing better, configure hash factors based on traffic types.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe load-balance hash-fields mac command is cyclic in nature, and only the latest configuration takes effect. After the command is configured, the hash calculation is performed based on the new hash factors.\nFollow-up Procedure\nIf this command is configured but traffic load balancing cannot be performed well in the AC end of the PE in the VPLS or common Layer 2 forwarding, you can run the load-balance hash-arithmetic command to modify the hash algorithm itself.\nThe function takes effect on the following types of boards: LPUF-50/LPUF-50-L/LPUI-21-L/LPUI-51-L/LPUF-51/LPUF-51-B/LPUI-51/LPUI-51-B/LPUI-51-S/LPUS-51/LPUF-101/LPUF-101-B/LPUI-101/LPUI-101-B/LPUS-101/LPUF-51-E/LPUI-51-E/LPUI-51-CM/LPUF-120/LPUF-120-B/LPUF-120-E/LPUI-102-E/LPUI-120/LPUI-120-B/LPUI-120-L/LPUI-52-E/LPUI-120-E/LPUI-120-CM/LPUF-240/LPUF-240-B/LPUF-240-E/LPUI-240/LPUI-240-B/LPUI-240-CM/LPUI-240-L/LPUF-480/LPUF-480-B/LPUI-480/LPUI-480-B/LPUI-480-L/LPUF-480-E/LPUI-480-CM/LPUI-200/LPUI-200-L/LPUF-200/LPUF-200-B/LPUI-1T/LPUI-1T-B/LPUI-1T-L/LPUI-1T-CM/LPUI-2T/LPUI-2T-B/LPUI-2T-CM/LPUF-481/LPUF-402-E/LPUI-241/LPUI-241-B/LPUI-241-CM//LPUF-241/LPUF-241-E/LPUF-52/LPUF-1T-E/LPUI-1T-CM/LPUF-1T-L\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe preceding configurations apply to ECMP (NHP based load balancing) and trunk logical interfaces (load balancing based on trunk tables). That is, ECMP and trunk load balancing behaviors are the same.\nThis command takes effect in EVPN-MPLS and EVPN-VXLAN scenarios."
