    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a private route forwarding scenario on an L3VPN, PE by default balance traffic to the CE through a maximum of two paths.\nTo enable multi-path load balancing, run the load-balance extend-enhance enable command on PE.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf multi-path PE load balancing is manually configured and the load-balance extend-enhance enable command is not run, service traffic is balanced over a maximum of two paths.\nPrecautions\nThe commands can not be run on LPUF-50/LPUF-50-L/LPUI-21-L/LPUI-51-L/LPUF-51/LPUF-51-B/LPUI-51/LPUI-51-B/LPUS-51/LPUF-101/LPUF-101-B/LPUI-101/LPUI-101-B/LPUS-101.When user-to-network load-balancing traffic passes through multiple boards, enable multi-path load balancing on all such boards, which prevents load imbalance.This command supports a maximum of 64 paths PE load balancing.If multi-path PE load balancing is enabled on the upstream board but not on the downstream board, downstream traffic sampling may be incorrect.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThis command takes effect in EVPN L3VPN over MPLS and EVPN 6vPE scenarios instead of L3VPN over SRv6 and EVPN L3VPN over SRv6 scenarios."
