    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo delete an ACL rule in the user ACL view, run the undo rule command.\nPrerequisites\nA user ACL has been created using the acl command.\nA validity period has been configured using the time-range command in the system view if you want the specified user ACL rule to take effect only in a specified period of time.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen specifying a user ACL rule ID, note the following:\nIf a rule with a specified rule ID already exists, and the new rule conflicts with the existing one, the conflicting part in the new rule overwrites that in the existing rule.If no rule with the specified rule ID exists, a rule with the specified rule ID is created.\nWhen a user ACL rule ID is not specified and a rule is added, the system automatically allocates an ID to this rule. User ACL rules are arranged in ascending order of rule IDs, with the difference between two adjacent rules as an ACL increment.\nThe rule numbers automatically generated by the system start from the ACL increment. For example, if the ACL increment is 5, the rule number starts from 5; if the ACL increment is 2, the rule number starts from 2. This allows you to add rules before the first rule.\nExercise caution when you run the rule deny ip command. This configuration may cause a service interruption.\n\nPrecautions\nIf auto is configured when you run the acl command to create an ACL, you cannot specify a rule ID when creating a rule. The system automatically uses the ACL increment as the start rule ID, and the subsequent rules are numbered by an ACL increment in ascending order.\nIf rule-id is not specified when you run the rule command to create an ACL, the system automatically assigns an ID to the ACL rule. You can run the display acl command to check the rule ID automatically assigned to an ACL.\nIf name rule-name is not specified when you run the rule command to create an ACL, the system automatically generates a name for the ACL in the format of \"rule\"+\"_\"+rule ID. Rule ID is the ID of an ACL rule that can be specified using the rule-id parameter or automatically assigned by the system. You can check the automatically generated name of an ACL rule through the NMS.\nYou must specify the rule ID when deleting a rule. To check rule IDs, run the display acl command.\nBefore deleting an ACL rule, run the display acl command to check whether the ACL rule has been applied to other services. Delete the rule only when it is not applied to other services."
