    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAdvanced ACLs match packets based on the source IP address, destination IP address, IP protocol type, and protocol-specific configurations (for example, source and destination TCP ports and ICMP protocol type and code) of the packets. To create an advanced ACL, run the acl command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe undo acl all command deletes all types of ACLs on a device. If the ACLs being deleted are applied to services, these services are interrupted. Before deleting an ACL, ensure that the ACL is not referenced by services.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the rule command to configure a rule for a created advanced ACL. Then the ACL rule can be applied to match packets.\nRun the description command to configure a description for a created advanced ACL. The description can contain the functions of the advanced ACL, facilitating applications."
