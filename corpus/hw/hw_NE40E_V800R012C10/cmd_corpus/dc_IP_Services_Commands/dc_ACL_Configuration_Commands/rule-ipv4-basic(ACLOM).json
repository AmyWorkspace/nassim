    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a basic ACL is created, run the rule command to add rules to the ACL.\n\"rule permit\" and \"rule permit source any\" have the same matching result.\n\"rule deny\" and \"rule deny source any\" have the same matching result.\nAdvanced ACL rules with the fragment-type can prevent such attacks by permitting only non-fragmented packets. In normal situations, Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is set on networks so that packets cannot be fragmented.\nPrerequisites\nA basic ACL has been created using the acl command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen specifying an ACL rule ID, note the following:\nIf a rule with a specified rule ID already exists, and the new rule conflicts with the existing one, the conflicting part in the new rule overwrites that in the existing rule.If no rule with the specified rule ID exists, a rule with the specified rule ID is created.\nWhen an ACL rule ID is not specified and a rule is added, the system automatically allocates an ID to this rule. ACL rules are arranged in ascending order of rule IDs, with the difference between two adjacent rules as an ACL increment.\nThe rule IDs automatically generated by the system start from the ACL increment. For example, if the ACL increment is 5, the rule ID starts from 5; if the ACL increment is 2, the rule ID starts from 2. This allows you to add rules before the first rule.\nBy default, if an ACL is not configured with the fragment-type:\nIf only Layer 3 information is configured to the rule, the ACL rules will filter all packets (including the first fragment of a packet, non-first fragments, and non-fragmented packets).If both Layer 3 and Layer 4 information is configured to the rule,The ACL filters the first fragment of a packet and non-fragmented packets, as these packets contain Layer 3 and Layer 4 information.Only Layer 3 information about non-first fragments is filtered, as they contain Layer 3 information never Layer 4 information. If Layer 3 information matches the \"permit\" rule, the non-first fragment is allowed to pass through; if Layer 3 information matches the \"deny\" rule, continue matching the non-first fragment against the next rule. ( This is different to the normal ACL working process.)\n\nPrecautions\nIf auto is configured when you run the acl command to create an ACL, you cannot specify a rule ID when creating a rule. The system automatically uses the ACL increment as the start rule ID, and the subsequent rules are numbered by an ACL increment in ascending order.\nIf rule-id is not specified when you run the rule command to create an ACL, the system automatically assigns an ID to the ACL rule. You can run the display acl command to check the rule ID automatically assigned to an ACL.\nIf name rule-name is not specified when you run the rule command to create an ACL, the system automatically generates a name for the ACL in the format of \"rule\"+\"_\"+rule ID. Rule ID is the ID of an ACL rule that can be specified using the rule-id parameter or automatically assigned by the system. You can check the automatically generated name of an ACL rule through the NMS.\nYou must specify the rule ID when deleting a rule. To check rule IDs, run the display acl command.\nBefore deleting an ACL rule, run the display acl command to check whether the ACL rule has been applied to other services. Delete the rule only when it is not applied to other services."
