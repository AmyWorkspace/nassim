    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn typical ACL usage scenarios, such as in QoS policy scenarios, a user may need to match both the source and destination port numbers. To match an ACL rule against multiple source and destination port numbers to implement a QoS policy, the user needs to create an ACL port pool and run the eq, gt, lt, or range command to add desired port numbers to the ACL port pool, or run the neq command to rule out unneeded port numbers from the ACL port number. When these port numbers are cohesive, you can run the eq, gt, lt, or range command to add multiple port numbers to the ACL port pool.\nPrerequisites\nAn ACL port pool has been created using the acl port-pool command."
