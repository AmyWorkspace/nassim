    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn ACL increment is the difference between two adjacent and automatically allocated ACL rule numbers. For example, if the increment is set to 5, rule numbers start at 5 and increase by an increment of 5, yielding rule numbers of 5, 10, 15, 20, and so on. To specify an ACL increment, run the step command.\nYou can use an ACL increment to maintain ACL rules and add new ACL rules conveniently.\nAssume that a user has created four rules numbered from 1 to 4 in an ACL. The user can reconfigure the ACL increment, for example, to 2 by running the step 2 command in the ACL view. The original rule numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are renumbered as 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively. After that, the user can run the rule 3 command to add a rule numbered 3 between the renumbered rules 2 and 4.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe numbers of rules in an ACL realign automatically when the ACL increment changes.\nPrecautions\nChanging the ACL increment causes rule numbers to change but does not affect the rules' priorities."
