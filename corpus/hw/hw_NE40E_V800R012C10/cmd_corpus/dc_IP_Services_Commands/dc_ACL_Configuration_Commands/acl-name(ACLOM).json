To create a user ACL, run the acl command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe undo acl all command deletes all types of ACLs on a device. If the ACLs being deleted are applied to services, these services are interrupted. Before deleting an ACL, ensure that the ACL is not referenced by services.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the rule command to configure a rule for a created user ACL. Then the ACL rule can be applied to match packets.\nRun the description command to configure a description for a created user ACL. The description can contain the functions of the user ACL, facilitating applications.\nPrecautions\nIn CU separation southbound delivery scenarios, this command is mutually exclusive with the cu-agent command."
