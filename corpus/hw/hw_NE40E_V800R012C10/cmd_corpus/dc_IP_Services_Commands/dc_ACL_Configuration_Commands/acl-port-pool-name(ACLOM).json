    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn typical ACL usage scenarios, such as QoS traffic policy, a user may need to match multiple port numbers. To implement policy-based routing using advanced ACL rules to match multiple source and destination port numbers, the user needs to specify all possible combinations of source and destination port numbers when configuring ACL rules. On large-scale networks, tens of millions of ACL rules may need to be manually configured to match the port numbers, which is not viable.\nTo reduce the configuration workload, run the acl port-pool command to create an ACL port pool. You only need to configure an ACL rule with a specified port pool name (pool-name) to match multiple port numbers.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the eq/gt/lt/range command to configure the port range of an ACL port pool.\nPrecautions\nThe device can only create an advanced ACL port pool."
