    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA Layer 2 ACL defines rules for filtering packets based on Layer 2 information, such as the source MAC addresses, destination MAC addresses, and Layer 2 protocol types of packets. To create a Layer 2 ACL, run the acl command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe undo acl all command deletes all types of ACLs on a device. If the ACLs being deleted are applied to services, these services are interrupted. Before deleting an ACL, ensure that the ACL is not referenced by services.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the rule command to configure a rule for a created advanced ACL. Then the ACL rule can be applied to match packets.\nRun the description command to configure a description for a created advanced ACL. The description can contain the functions of the advanced ACL, facilitating applications."
