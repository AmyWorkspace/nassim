    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen dynamic DNS is used, run the dns server ipv6 source-ip command to specify a source IPv6 address for an IPv6 DNS client. The client then uses this source IPv6 address to communicate with an IPv6 DNS server, which ensures security. The IPv6 DNS server then sends a response to the IPv6 DNS client through the route to the source IPv6 address. If no source IPv6 address is specified, an IPv6 DNS client selects a source address based on the destination address for each IPv6 DNS domain name resolution request.\nPrerequisites\nBefore the dns server ipv6 source-ip command is run, perform the following operations:\nDynamic DNS has been enabled using the dns resolve command in the system view.A DNS server address has been configured using the dns server ipv6 command in the system view.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the dns server ipv6 source-ip command is run, perform the following operations to implement dynamic DNS:\nrun the dns domain command to configure the domain name suffix."
