    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the source IPv6 address type of the DHCPv6 request packets sent by a DHCPv6 client is link-local, the source IPv6 address type of the DHCPv6 response packets sent by different devices may vary, some as link-local and some others as global.\nBy default, the source IPv6 address of the response packets sent by a device to a DHCPv6 client is a global address. To enhance flexibility in device interworking, run the dhcpv6 source-ip-address format adaptive enable command to configure the source IPv6 address type of the response packets sent by a device to a DHCPv6 client as link-local when the destination IPv6 address type is also link-local.\nIn some scenarios such as LDRA and DHCPv6 relay interconnection, LDRA requires that the source and destination IPv6 addresses in packets must be link-local address. In this case, run the dhcpv6 source-ip-address format adaptive enable command on the DHCPv6 relay."
