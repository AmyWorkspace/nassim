    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo limit the maximum number of access DHCPv6 clients during network planning or service adjustment, run the dhcpv6 relay access-limit command.\nThe dhcpv6 relay access-limit limit-number command configures the maximum number of access DHCPv6 clients on a DHCPv6 relay interface.\nConfiguration Impact\nThis command takes effect for subsequent DHCPv6 clients that go online. The maximum number of online DHCPv6 clients is not limited.\nPrecautions\nIf the dhcpv6 relay access-limit command is run with a VLAN range specified, and then the undo dhcpv6 relay access-limit command is run with a smaller VLAN range specified, the first VLAN range is divided into two parts. After the VLAN range specified in the dhcpv6 relay access-limit command is divided into 16 parts, the undo dhcpv6 relay access-limit command can no longer be run."
