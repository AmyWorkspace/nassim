    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a large number of DHCPv6 clients go online directly, a large number of DHCPv6 clients go online through a DHCPv6 relay agent, or the DHCPv6 relay agent or DHCPv6 server is busy due to message attacks, run the dhcpv6 rate-limit command to set a rate limit for DHCPv6 messages. If the rate of DHCPv6 messages exceeds the limit, some DHCPv6 messages are discarded, reducing CPU usage and increasing the user access rate. The rate limit for DHCPv6 messages can be adjusted based on network conditions.\nIf you do not need to limit the rate of DHCPv6 messages, run the dhcpv6 rate-limit disable command to disable global rate limiting for DHCPv6 messages."
