    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA DHCPv6 relay server group is a set of DHCPv6 relay servers. If you want to enable DHCPv6 relay on multiple interfaces and specify the same DHCPv6 relay servers for these interfaces, run the dhcpv6 relay server group command to configure a DHCPv6 relay server group and run the dhcpv6 relay binding server group command to bind the interfaces to the server group. This simplifies configuration.\nPrecautions\nA maximum of 10 DHCPv6 relay server groups can be configured on a device.\nYou cannot run the undo dhcpv6 relay server group command to delete a DHCPv6 relay server group that has been bound to interfaces."
