    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, CAR for whitelisted DHCPv6 sessions is enabled to isolate the sessions. This prevents DHCPv6 packets from different DHCPv6 servers from preempting one another's bandwidth resources. If CAR for whitelisted DHCPv6 sessions is abnormal, you can run the whitelist session-car dhcpv6 disable command to disable this function so that DHCPv6 packets can be sent to the CPU properly. Under normal circumstances, enabling CAR for whitelisted DHCPv6 sessions is recommended."
