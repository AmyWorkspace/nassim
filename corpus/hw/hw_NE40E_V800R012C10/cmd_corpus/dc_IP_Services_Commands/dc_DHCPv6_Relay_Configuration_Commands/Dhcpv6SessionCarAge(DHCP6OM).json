    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCAR for whitelisted DHCPv6 sessions is enabled by default. A device generates whitelists based on information in DHCPv6 packets from different DHCPv6 servers to isolate the packets. After a whitelist is generated, if the device does not receive packets from the DHCPv6 server to which the whitelist belongs within 30 minutes, it ages out the whitelist by default. To adjust the aging time of a whitelist involved in CAR for whitelisted DHCPv6 sessions, run the whitelist session-car dhcpv6 aging-time command."
