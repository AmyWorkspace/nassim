    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn PD scenarios, a DHCPv6 relay agent delivers PD routes to clients based on the prefixes assigned by a server to the client. By default, after a DHCPv6 relay agent is restarted, the PD routes are lost, so users cannot access the network. To allow a DHCPv6 relay agent to save PD routes to a file so that it can restore the PD routes from the file after a restart, run the dhcpv6 relay pd-route auto-save command.\nPrecautions\nIf multiple PD route files have been saved on a relay agent, after the relay agent is restarted, it uses the file that was last saved before the restart. All the other files do not take effect.After the command is run on a device, the device automatically saves PD routes every hour."
