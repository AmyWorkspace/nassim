    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAlthough the delay time for sending packets differs from that for receiving packets, 1588v2 considers that the opposite paths have the same delay time. To compensate for the difference between the delay time for sending packets and the delay time for receiving packets, run the ptp asymmetry-correction command to set the asymmetry correction value. A 1588v2 device automatically uses the asymmetry correction value in path delay calculation complying with the Pdelay or delay measurement mechanism.\nPrerequisites\nTime synchronization has been enabled for port extension using the clock time enable command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
