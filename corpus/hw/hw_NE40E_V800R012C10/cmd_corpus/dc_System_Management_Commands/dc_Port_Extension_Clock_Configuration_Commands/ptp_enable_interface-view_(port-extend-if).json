    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n1588v2 is enabled in the system and interface views:\nRun the ptp enable command in the system view to enable 1588v2 on a device. 1588v2 functions can be configured in the system view.Run the ptp enable command to enable 1588v2 on an interface so that the interface can send and receive PTP packets. If an interface is selected as the beset master clock, the device where the interface resides can perform clock synchronization using the PTP packets received by the interface.\nPTP can be enabled on only one interface of the OC.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nIf port PTP needs to be enabled for an SMPTE-2059-2 network and Layer 3 packet encapsulation is not configured, the IP address of the management interface is used as the source IP address configured in the ptp udp-egress source-ip command.\nAfter the undo ptp udp-egress source-ip command is run on an SMPTE-2059-2 interface, the PTP function is automatically disabled."
