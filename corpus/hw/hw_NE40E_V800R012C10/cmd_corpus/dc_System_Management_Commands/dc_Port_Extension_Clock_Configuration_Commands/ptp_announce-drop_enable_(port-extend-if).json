    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTwo devices exchange Announce packets to determine the master/slave relationship. The master device sends Sync packets to notify the slave device of time signal parameters and uses a delay measurement mechanism to achieve time signals accuracy.\nAfter 1588v2 is enabled globally on a device, all interfaces on the device send and receive Announce packets. Some interfaces do not participate in time synchronization and do not need to receive Announce packets that may affect the transmission of other services. To disable these interfaces from receiving Announce packets, run the ptp announce-drop enable command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
