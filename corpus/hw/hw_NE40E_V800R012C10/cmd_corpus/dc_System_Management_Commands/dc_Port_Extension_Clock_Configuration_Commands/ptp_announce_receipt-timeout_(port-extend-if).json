    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTwo devices exchange Announce packets to determine the master/slave relationship. The master device sends Sync packets to notify the slave device of time signal parameters and uses a delay measurement mechanism to achieve time signals accuracy.\nTo set the maximum number of Announce packets that a 1588v2 interface fails to receive consecutively, run the ptp announce receipt-timeout command. If the 1588v2 interface on a device fails to receive a specified number of Announce packets, the interface status becomes Master, and the device stops attempting to synchronize the time with other 1588v2 devices. The device uses the BMC algorithm to select a clock source and synchronize the time with the clock source. Increase receipt-timeout to reduce the clock source switching frequency; reduce receipt-timeout to switch clock sources. Using the default value is recommended.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
