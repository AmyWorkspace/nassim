    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command is used to configure a threshold for the SSM level of clock signals sent by BITS interfaces. When the SSM level of clock signals sent by BITS interfaces is lower than the configured threshold, the device blocks the BITS interfaces from sending clock signals and generates an alarm. In this manner, the device blocks the BITS interfaces from sending clock signals with poor quality.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
