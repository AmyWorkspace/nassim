This signal type must be the same as the signal type of this external BITS clock.\nPrerequisites\nThis command applies only to 1588-capable main control boards and is used to configure the signal type of BITS interfaces.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nIf the signal type is set to 1pps, separately specify the signal input and output directions. If the signal type is set to a value other than 1pps, this value takes effect for both the signal input and output directions."
