    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a clock synchronization network has higher requirements for the frequency deviation of clock signals, enable frequency deviation detection. When frequency deviation detection is enabled, the device performs frequency deviation detection for clock signals. If a detected frequency deviation exceeds a normal range, the clock source is unreliable. In this situation, the device may automatically reselect a clock source.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
