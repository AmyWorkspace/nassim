    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTwo devices exchange Announce packets to determine the master/slave relationship. The master device sends Sync packets to notify the slave device of time signal parameters and uses a delay measurement mechanism to achieve time signals accuracy.\nThe master interface periodically sends multicast Sync packets. If devices exchange Sync packets frequently and consume a lot of bandwidth resources, increase the sync-interval value. If time synchronization accuracy is low, reduce the sync-interval value.\nPrerequisites\n1588v2 has been enabled on an interface using the ptp enable command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe time when the Sync packets can be stamped into the Sync packets if the one-step timestamping mode is used or into Follow_Up packets if the two-step timestamping mode is used. To specify a timestamping mode, run the ptp clock-step { one-step | two-step } command."
