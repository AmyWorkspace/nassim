    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nStatic ACR is an adaptive clock recovery technology. A Router enabled with the static 1588 ACR function can restore clock information from the 1588v2 packets sent by the clock server if the upstream device does not support 1588v2.\nGenerally, if 1588v2 time synchronization performance is insufficient and only frequency synchronization is required, you can enable this function.\nPrerequisites\n1588v2 has been enabled on the Router.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
