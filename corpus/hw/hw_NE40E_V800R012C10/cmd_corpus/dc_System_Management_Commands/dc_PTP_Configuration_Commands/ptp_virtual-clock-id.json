For example, a system has a MAC address 111122223333, and the default clock ID of the system is 111122fffe223333.\nBy default, a PTP device has only a default clock ID.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA clock ID uniquely identifies a PTP device in a single clock domain. The default clock ID is determined by the system MAC address.\nThe default clock ID remains even if the active main board (AMB)/standby main board (SMB) switchover is performed or the AMB is replaced. If an AMB is removed from a device and installed in another device, the clock IDs of the two devices are the same. To address this problem, run the ptp virtual-clock-id command to set a virtual clock ID for either of the two devices. The configured virtual clock ID also uniquely identifies the PTP device and does not change even if the AMB is replaced.\nPrerequisites\nPTP has been enabled on the device using the ptp enable command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
