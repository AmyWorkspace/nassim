    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPacket bearer devices can input reference clock signals through a PTP or 1PPS+TOD interface for time synchronization. When a PTP interface is used to input reference clock signals, the clockClass of the clock source is less than the alarm generation threshold configured using the ptp alarm-threshold clock-class command, and the stepsRemoved of the clock source is 0, an alarm is generated, indicating that the input reference clock signals deteriorate. When a 1PPS+TOD interface is used to input reference clock signals and the clockClass of the clock source is less than the alarm generation threshold configured using the ptp alarm-threshold clock-class command, an alarm is generated, indicating that the input reference clock signals deteriorate.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
