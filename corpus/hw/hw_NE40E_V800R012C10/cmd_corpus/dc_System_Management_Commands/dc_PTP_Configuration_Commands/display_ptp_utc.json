    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nUTC is also the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The PTP devices use the UTC. To check the UTC, run the display ptp utc command. If the device implements time synchronization through an external clock source interface, an output example of the display ptp utc command is UTC Time:2015-01-04 09:56:24. If the device has not implemented time synchronization, the output of the command is Non-UTC Time:2015-01-04 09:56:24. Each time after the device restarts, the system time resumes from the current time.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
