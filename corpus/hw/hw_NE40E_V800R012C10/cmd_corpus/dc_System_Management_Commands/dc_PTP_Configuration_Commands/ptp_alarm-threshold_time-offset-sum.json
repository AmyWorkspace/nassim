    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA device of the BC/T-BC or OC slave type supports time offset accumulation and detection. If the peak value of the accumulated time offsets exceeds the threshold, an alarm will be reported. The peak value of the accumulated time offsets is the difference between the maximum and minimum time offsets within a specified period.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
