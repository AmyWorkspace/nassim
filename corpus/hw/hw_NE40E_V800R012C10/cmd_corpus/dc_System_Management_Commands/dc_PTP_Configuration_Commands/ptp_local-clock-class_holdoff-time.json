    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis function is turned off by default. It is suggested that this function should be deployed on the equipment directly connected with the base station with G.8275.1 protocol, and the holding time is equivalent to that of the base station.\nG. 8275.1 protocol scenario, under the premise that the local source clock class changes from 248 to 165, you can configure the retention time of local source clock class through this command. After configuration, if the clock class of the locked time server is less than or equal to 135, it will change to 135 first, and then to 165 (non-g.8275.1 protocol, which does not have actual effect)."
