    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a device can obtain the absolute time reference source through an external BITS clock source, the device can compare the external reference time and PTP time and reports the time difference. If the time difference exceeds the threshold, an alarm will be reported. To configure the alarm threshold for the difference between the eternal reference time and PTP time, run the ptp alarm-threshold standard-time-offset command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
