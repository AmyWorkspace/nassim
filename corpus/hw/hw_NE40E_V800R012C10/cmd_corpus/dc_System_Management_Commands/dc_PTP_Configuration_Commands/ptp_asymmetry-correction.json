    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAlthough the delay time for sending packets differs from that for receiving packets, PTP considers that the opposite paths have the same delay time. To compensate for the difference between the delay time for sending packets and the delay time for receiving packets, run the ptp asymmetry-correction command to set the asymmetry correction value. A PTP device automatically uses the asymmetry correction value in path delay calculation complying with the Pdelay or delay measurement mechanism.\nPrerequisites\nThe ptp delay-mechanism command has been run to enable a delay measurement mechanism on OC, BC, TCandBC interfaces.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
