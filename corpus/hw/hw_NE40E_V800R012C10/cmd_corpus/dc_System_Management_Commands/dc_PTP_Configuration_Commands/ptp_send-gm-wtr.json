    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis function is disabled by default. You are advised to deploy this function on the device directly connected to the time source server with unstable output time performance. The WTR time should be longer than the fault recovery period of the time server.\nPrecautions\nThis configuration increases the TOPO switching time of PTP time synchronization. Therefore, you are not advised to use this function in scenarios where you expect to quickly perform PTP time synchronization TOPO switching. It is recommended that this configuration be deployed on a device directly connected to an unstable time source server. The configured time must be a little longer than the fault flapping period of the time server."
