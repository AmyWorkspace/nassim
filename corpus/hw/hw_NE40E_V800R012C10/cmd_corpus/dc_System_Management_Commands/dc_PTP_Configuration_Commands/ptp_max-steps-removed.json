    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo reduce impacts on synchronization performance after clocks form a loop, run the ptp max-steps-removed command to configure the maximum number of hops for a time synchronization device.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nWhen the stepsRemoved value in the Announce packets received by a clock source is greater than or equal to the specified maximum number of hops, the clock source is considered unavailable. The maximum number of hops needs to be specified based on the synchronization network scale."
