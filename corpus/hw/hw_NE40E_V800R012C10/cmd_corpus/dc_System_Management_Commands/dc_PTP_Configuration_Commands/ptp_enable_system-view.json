    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPTP is enabled in the system and interface views.\nRun the ptp enable command in the system view to enable PTP on a device. PTP functions can be configured in the system view.\nRun the ptp enable command to enable PTP on an interface so that the interface can send and receive PTP packets. If an interface is selected as the beset master clock, the device where the interface resides can perform clock synchronization using the PTP packets received by the interface.\nPrecautions\nThe main control board and subcard must support PTP. That is, hardware support for PTP is mandatory. The 10GE interfaces in WAN mode do not support PTP."
