    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the ptp source-switch ptsf enable command is used to enable ptsf time source switching, if the current time source is detected with offset hops(over 1.1us 3 seconds in a row) or Sync packets loss, the device will switch to other available time source. After the signal of the time source recovers normal, run the ptp source-switch ptsf recover command to restore the time source back to the trace source."
