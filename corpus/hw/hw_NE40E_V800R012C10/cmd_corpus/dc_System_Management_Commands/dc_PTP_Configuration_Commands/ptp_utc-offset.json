    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe UTC time is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) that is displayed on a 1588v2 device, There is a fixed offset between the UTC time and TAI time. The International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) advertises the offset.\nWhen a 1588v2 device tracks a BITS, the device uses the offset provided by the BITS by default. If the BITS clock signals are lost, the 1588v2 uses the previous offset, which may change. An offset change causes inaccurate time signals on the 1588v2 network.\nTo manually set the offset between the UTC time and TAI time, run the ptp utc-offset command only on the grandmaster.\nPrerequisites\n1588v2 has been enabled on the device using the ptp enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the ptp utc-offset command is run twice, the later command overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
