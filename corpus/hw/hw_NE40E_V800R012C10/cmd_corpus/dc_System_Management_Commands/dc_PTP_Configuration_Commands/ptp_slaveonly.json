    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn OC has only a single 1588v2 interface. This means that the OC can function as the master clock to advertise clock signals or as a slave clock to receive upstream clock signals. To enable an OC to work only as a slave clock on a clock synchronous network, run the ptp slaveonly command.\nThis command applies only to 1588v2 and SMPTE-2059-2.\nPrerequisites\nThe device has been configured as an OC using the ptp device-type oc command.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe ptp slaveonly command applies only to dynamic 1588v2 scenarios. The ptp set-port-state enable command is used to set 1588v2 interface status in static 1588v2 scenarios. The ptp slaveonly and ptp set-port-state enable commands are mutually exclusive."
