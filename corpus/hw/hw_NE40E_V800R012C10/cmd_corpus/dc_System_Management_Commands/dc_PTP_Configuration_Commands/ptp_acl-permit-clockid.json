    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device can select a reference clock within a given range of user-defined clock sources. To specify the ID of a clock that a local device uses to select the BMC, run the ptp acl-permit-clockid command. This command allows the device to select the BMC among clocks with IDs listed in the configured clock ID list. The implementation prevents clock flapping over an entire network resulting from clock attacks or incorrect configurations.\nPrerequisites\nThe control of access to clock sources has been enabled using the ptp acl enable command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display ptp all command on the local device to view clock IDs.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
