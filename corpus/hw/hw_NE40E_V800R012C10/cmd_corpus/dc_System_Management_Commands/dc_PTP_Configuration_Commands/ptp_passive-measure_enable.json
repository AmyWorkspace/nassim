    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA passive interface does not trace or advertise time information. If a device has multiple master PTP interfaces in the same clock domain, the device selects the interface with the highest priority as the master clock. The interface connected to the master clock is the slave clock. The unselected master interfaces enter the Passive state and function as backups for the slave clock. Passive interfaces can send Delay_Req, Pdelay_Resp, Delay_Resp_Follow_Up, signaling, and management response messages.\nA passive interface can be selected as a slave clock or a master clock to participate in time synchronization after a clock source changes. Monitoring the passive interface before a clock source changes helps keep stable time signals on a synchronous PTP network.\nWhen the display ptp all command output displays \"yes\" in the \"Time lock success\" field. The PTP network is time synchronous. To monitor time synchronization performance on the network, run the ptp passive-measure enable command.\nThe passive interface checks the offset between the master and slave clocks. If the offset is greater than a configured alarm threshold, the device sends an alarm named hwPtpPassiveFiberLengthChange to a network management system (NMS). To set the alarm threshold, run the ptp passive-measure alarm-threshold command.\nPrerequisites\nA passive interface is determined. The display ptp all command output contains \"passive\" in the State field of the Port Info part.\nPrecautions\nPassive interface performance monitoring has the following limitations:\nOn a ring network, PTPtime synchronization is performed on the entire network, and the primary and secondary links share the source and sink NEs. In this case, the primary link is used as a reference. Therefore, performance monitoring works for the offset values of the transit nodes on the primary and secondary links.After PTP passive interface performance monitoring is enabled on a router, ensure that the router is in stable tracing state.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
