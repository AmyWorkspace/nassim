If clock synchronization has not been enabled, the clock force source command does not take effect.If the status of a specified clock source is not normal or its SSM level is dnu, the system clock works in the hold state or free state.If the status of a manually specified clock source is neither normal nor holdoff, or its SSM level is not the highest, the clock manual source command does not take effect."
