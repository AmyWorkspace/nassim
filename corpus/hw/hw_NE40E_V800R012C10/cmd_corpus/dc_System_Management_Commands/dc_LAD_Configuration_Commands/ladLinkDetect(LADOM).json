    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn LAD-enabled interface can encapsulate local information into an LAD packet and send it to a neighbor. After receiving an LAD packet from the neighbor, the local interface can save local information and neighbor information carried in the packet to the local MIB. The local and neighbor information is recorded as one entry.\nTo enable a device to send LAD packets to neighbors, run the link detect command.\nPrecautions\nIf no parameter is specified, the device sends LAD packets through all interfaces.If no parameter is specified, the device sends LAD packets through all interfaces.If the interval at which this command is consecutively executed is less than 15 seconds, the system prompts you to wait for more than 15 seconds before running the command again.If the specified interface is shut down, link detection cannot be performed."
