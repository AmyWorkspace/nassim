The statistics includes the service collision, number of CRC errors, undersize or oversize packets, data timeout transmission, fragments, broadcast packets, multicast packets, and unicast packets.\nPrerequisites\nThe Ethernet statistics function has been enabled using the rmon-statistics enable command."
