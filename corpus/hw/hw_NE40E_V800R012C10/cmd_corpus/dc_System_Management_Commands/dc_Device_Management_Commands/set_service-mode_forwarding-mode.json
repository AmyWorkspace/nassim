    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device supports two forwarding modes: redundant and non-redundant.\nRedundant mode: The interface board has one backup. If the master interface board is faulty or you change the forwarding mode manually, the slave interface board automatically switches to the master state. In this way, the traffic can be forwarded continuously.Non-redundant mode: Two interface boards forward traffic simultaneously. In this way, the forwarding capability of the system is twice stronger than that in the redundant mode.\nBy default, the device runs in redundant mode. Forwarding mode switching is under license control. Purchase the license in advance. After the license is activated, run the mode switch command. The new forwarding mode takes effect after you restart the device.\n\nPrecautions\nThe new forwarding mode takes effect only when you restart the device. Ensure that you have saved the important data before restart."
