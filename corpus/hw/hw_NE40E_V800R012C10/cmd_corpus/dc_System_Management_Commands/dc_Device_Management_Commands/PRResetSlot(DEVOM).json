If the slave main control board exists on the device, the device automatically performs a master/slave switchover after the reset slot command is run.\nPrecautions\nThe reset slot command can only be used when the board or subcard is running.\nBefore the board or subcard is reset, save important data in advance.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
