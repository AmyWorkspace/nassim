    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe interface match check function can effectively avoid the configuration failure caused by installation of inappropriate boards or subcards. After the interface match check function is enabled, the system automatically checks whether the type of the newly inserted board or subcard matches that of the previous board or subcard, if the original board or subcard is replaced by a new one. If the types are different, an alarm is generated and the newly inserted board or subcard cannot restore the previous configurations. In this case, the board or subcard is unavailable.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the type of the newly inserted board or subcard is different from that of the previous one, an alarm is generated and the newly inserted board or subcard is unavailable. If you need to use this board, run the interface-match-check config-recovery command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
