    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the system to display the top 3 components with the highest memory usage when the memory is overloaded, run the memory-usage reliability switch on command to enable the memory usage reliability function.\nAfter the memory usage reliability function is enabled, when the memory usage of a board exceeds the level-1 overload threshold, the system displays the top 3 components to which the process with the highest memory usage belongs. When the memory usage of a board exceeds the level-2 overload threshold, the system displays the process with the highest memory usage. If the process is PROTO1, the system resets the PROTO1 process.\nPrecautions\nAfter the undo memory-usage reliability switch on command is run, the device is restarted if the memory usage of a board exceeds the specified threshold."
