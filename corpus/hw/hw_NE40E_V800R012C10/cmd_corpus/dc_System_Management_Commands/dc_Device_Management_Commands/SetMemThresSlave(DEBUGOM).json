    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA memory usage threshold is set, which helps monitor memory usage in time.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the memory usage reaches the overload threshold, the system triggers the SYSTEM_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.129.2.6.1 hwStorageUtilizationRisingAlarm alarm.\nWhen the memory usage decreases to the non-overload threshold, the system triggers the SYSTEM_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.129.2.6.2 hwStorageUtilizationResume alarm.\nPrecautions\nIf the overload threshold value of memory usage is set too small, the system will frequently trigger alarms.If the overload threshold value of memory usage is set too large, you cannot obtain information about high memory usage in time.In a board replacement scenario, if the board types are different before and after the replacement, board configurations are re-reported after the replacement. As a result, original board configurations are lost, and the new board configurations are restored as default configurations.In VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
