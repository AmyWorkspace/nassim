    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device provides the environment monitoring function to monitor the environment change. In this case, the maintenance personnel do not need to implement on-site environment monitoring. When detecting the environment change, the device reports an alarm to the NMS. The maintenance personnel can then adjust environment parameters accordingly. This can effectively reduce the maintenance expenditure of the equipment room.\nIn addition, the same ID can be configured for alarms of the same type that are generated by the device.\nPrecautions\nThis command is applicable only to the device equipped with the CMU module.\nAlarm information to be reported, such as the alarm reporting list and alarm severity, needs to be customized in software based on customer requirements. In the current version, only hardware is designed to support this function.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
