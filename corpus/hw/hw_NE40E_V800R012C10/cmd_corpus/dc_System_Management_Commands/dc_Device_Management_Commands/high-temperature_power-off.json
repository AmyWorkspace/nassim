    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe high-temperature working environment reduces the board lifespan. You can run the display temperature command to view the temperature alarm thresholds on each board. The alarm levels are minor, major, and fatal. When the board temperature is higher than a specific threshold, the corresponding level of alarm occurs. When the temperature is 5degreeC below the alarm threshold, the alarm is cleared. After the high-temperature power-off enable command is run, a board powers off automatically when temperatures of three or more monitoring nodes on the board are 5degreeC above the fatal high temperature alarm threshold.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
