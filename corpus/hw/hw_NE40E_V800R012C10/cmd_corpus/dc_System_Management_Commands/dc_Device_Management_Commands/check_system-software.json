    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the system software is uploaded to the device for upgrade, running the check system-software command to check the checksum of the specified system software is recommended. This can avoid upgrade failure due to the error during the upload of the system software.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nWhen a user is upgrading versions in service or checking versions, others cannot check the checksum of the specified system software at the same time."
