    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the maximum number of subcard interfaces that can be used on an AP is limited. To extend the number of subcard interfaces on an AP, run the set service-mode port-extended command. After the command is run, all the subcard interfaces on an AP can be used. This command applies only to CSFP subcards.\nPrecautions\nAfter the command is run, the interface boards of the AP are powered off, causing all subcards to be powered off and then on.\nThe command can be successfully run in the AP view only when the AP is an X2 device and the interface board is a 240/480/1T.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
