    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the board voltage reaches the alarm threshold, an alarm is generated and the maintenance personnel improve the working environment based on the alarm information. If a board is configured with abnormal voltage alarm thresholds, misleading alarms will be generated. The voltage-threshold command can be used to modify the voltage alarm thresholds.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
