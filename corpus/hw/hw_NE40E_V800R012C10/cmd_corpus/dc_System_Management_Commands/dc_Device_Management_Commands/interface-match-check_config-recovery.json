    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the interface match check function is enabled, the system automatically checks whether the type of the newly inserted board matches that of the previous board, if the original board is replaced by a new one.\nIf the types are the same, you can run the interface-match-check config-recoveryenable [ slot [ card ] ] command to restore the previous configurations.If the types are different, an alarm is generated and the newly inserted board is unavailable. If you determine to use this board, run the interface-match-check config-recovery enable [ slot [ card ] ] command to make the newly inserted board available. In this case, the previous configurations cannot be restored and you need to re-configure the interfaces on this board.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nThe interface-match-check config-recovery command is board-specific. That is, whenever a new board or subcard is inserted, you need to run the interface-match-check config-recovery command to enable the configuration restoration function.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
