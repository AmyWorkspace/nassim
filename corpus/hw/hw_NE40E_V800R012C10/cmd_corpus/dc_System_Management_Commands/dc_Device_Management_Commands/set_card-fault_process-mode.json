    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen detecting a hardware fault during subcard startup, the system prevents the subcard from registering and resets the subcard for automatic fault rectification. If you enable the global port isolation function by running the set card-fault process-mode isolate command, the system isolates only the port corresponding to the faulty component and allows the subcard to directly register after the faulty port is isolated.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
