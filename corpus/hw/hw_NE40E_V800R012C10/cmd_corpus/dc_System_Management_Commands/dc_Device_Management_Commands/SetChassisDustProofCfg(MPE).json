    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThis command is used to configure a cleaning cycle for the air filter on the chassis. When the air filter has been running for a period of time, the system generates an alarm to remind you of the air filter cleaning. Then, the reset dustproof run-time command is used to clear the alarm and re-count the runtime of the air filter. The default cleaning cycle is 90 days. The value 0 indicates that the monitoring of the air filter is stopped.\nPrecautions\nThe air filter is a component without memory. All the monitored information is saved on the MPU, which may be inserted, removed, switched, or replaced during usage. Therefore, the monitoring cycle may differ from the set cycle, but this does not affect the monitoring function.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
