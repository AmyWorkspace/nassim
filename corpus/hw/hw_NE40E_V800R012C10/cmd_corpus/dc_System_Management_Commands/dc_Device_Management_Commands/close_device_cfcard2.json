    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEach MPU of the router has two CF cards. One is fixed in the circuit board of the MPU and is used to save the system file and configuration file, and the other lies on the panel of the MPU and is used to store logs and alarms. The first CF card cannot be removed whereas the second CF card can be plugged out and inserted.\nWhen the router runs properly, CF card 2 on the MPU needs to be powered off when being replaced. There are two methods to power off the CF card:\nRun the close device cfcard2 command.Press the offline button on the CF card.\n\nPrecautions\nCF card 2 supports hot swapping. Before performing swapping for CF card 2, run the close device cfcard2 slot slot-id. After the command is entered, a message indicating whether the current device supports swapping will be displayed. Ensure that the swapping operation does not affect system functions.\nIt can be used only on the device on which a CF card serves as a storage device.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
