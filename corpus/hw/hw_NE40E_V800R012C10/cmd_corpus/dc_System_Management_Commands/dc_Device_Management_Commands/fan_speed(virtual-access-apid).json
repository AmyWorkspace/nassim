    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can configure a desired fan speed adjustment mode based on the number of working boards on the device.\nauto: To meet heat dissipation requirements, the device automatically adjusts the fan speed based on the ambient temperature reported by the temperature sensor of the associated board.full: Fans work at the highest speed.silent: The fan speed is automatically adjusted. However, fans work with a small speed adjustment step to control the automatically adjusted fan speed, preventing the noise from being abruptly increased due to a great fan gear change.minimum-percent: The device automatically adjusts the fan speed based on the ambient temperature reported by the temperature sensor of the associated board, provided that the fan speed is not lower than the configured minimum speed percentage.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nConfiguring fans to work at a full speed improves device heat dissipation but increases power consumption.\nAttention"
