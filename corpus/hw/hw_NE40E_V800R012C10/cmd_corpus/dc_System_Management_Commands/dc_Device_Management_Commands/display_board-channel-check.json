    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a component on a slave main control board needs to be replaced, and only a spare part running an earlier version is available, the spare part needs to be upgraded. If the upgrade is performed by pressing Ctrl+B, the upgrade takes a long time because it involves BootLoad and BootROM upgrade, CF card formatting, and file copying. If the upgrade lasts 5 minutes or longer and slave main control board registration monitoring is enabled, the slave main control board may be reset in no bootp mode by the master main control board. To check whether slave main control board registration monitoring is enabled, run the display board-channel-check command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
