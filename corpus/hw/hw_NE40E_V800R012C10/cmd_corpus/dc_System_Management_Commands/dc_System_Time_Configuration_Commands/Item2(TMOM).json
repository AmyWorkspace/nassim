In addition, the message time such as log time and debug time is displayed in the configured summer time.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nConfiguration Impact\nNote the following issues:\nThe time in messages such as logs and debugging information is the local time adjusted according to the time zone and the configured daylight saving time.The time in the output of the display commands is the local time adjusted based on the time zone and the configured daylight saving time.\nBefore you remove the configuration of the daylight saving time, note the following points:\nIf the configured daylight saving time has taken effect, after you remove the configuration of the daylight saving time, the router minus the offset of the daylight saving time.If the configured daylight saving time does not take effect, removing the configuration of the daylight saving time does not affect on the system time.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display clock command to view detailed information about the system time after the configured daylight saving time takes effect."
