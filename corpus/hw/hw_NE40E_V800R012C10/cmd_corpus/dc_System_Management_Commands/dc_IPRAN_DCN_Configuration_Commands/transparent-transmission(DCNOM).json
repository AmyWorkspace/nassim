    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a DCN has a large number of NEs, the DCN must be split. If a cross-ring gateway network element (GNE) is connected to rings where a large number of NEs exist, the rings are negatively affected, and services on the rings cannot be protected. In this case, you can configure DCN packet transparent transmission to protect the services.\nThis command is supported only in transport node.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nTransparent transmission must be configured before DCN is enabled on an interface.The inbound and outbound interfaces in a transparent transmission interface pair can reside on different boards but must both be Ethernet interfaces.If bidirectional transparent transmission is configured between interfaces 1 and 2, only one transparent transmission entry is generated regardless of which interface is configured first.DCN supports a maximum of five transparent transmission entries."
