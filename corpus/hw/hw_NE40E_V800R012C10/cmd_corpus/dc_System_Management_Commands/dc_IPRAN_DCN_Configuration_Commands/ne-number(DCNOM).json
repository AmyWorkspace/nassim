    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo prevent a GNE from being overloaded with NEs, run the ne-number alarm threshold command to set an alarm threshold for the number of NEs. After the alarm threshold is reached, the GNE reports an alarm to the NMS.\nThe conditions for alarm generation are as follows:\nIf the number of NEs exceeds the configured threshold, the hwIpRanDcnNeNumberOverLoad alarm is generated.If the number of NEs falls below the configured threshold, the hwIpRanDcnNeNumberOverLoadRecovery alarm is generated.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe DCN feature has been enabled globally using the dcn command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
