    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve system performance, you can decrease the packet sending bandwidth of a DCN interface to reduce CPU usage when the device is heavily loaded but increase the packet sending bandwidth to raise CPU usage when the device is lightly loaded.\nThe bandwidth command helps modify the packet sending bandwidth of a DCN interface based on CPU usage.\nThe bandwidth command is supported only in transport mode.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
