    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNetwork packets have different priorities, and high-priority packets will be transmitted first. Run the\ndata-packet priority command to configure a priority for DCN packets based on the service traffic situation of the network.\nIf the priorities of other packets are higher than the priority of DCN packets, decrease the DCN packet priority to prevent packet loss.If the priorities of other packets are lower than the priority of DCN packets, increase the DCN packet priority to facilitate the communications between NEs or between NEs and NMSs.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe data-packet priority command cannot be used to configure a priority for link-layer or OSPF protocol packets because their priority is the highest by default."
