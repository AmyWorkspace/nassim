    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDCN communication can be implemented between Huawei devices and NMSs through Telnet, but not between Huawei devices and RTNs. RTNs use microwave links for service transmission, and no cables are required, which reduces network deployment cost.\nAfter the DCN compatible mode is configured on a GNE using the set compatible mode command, the GNE can manage RTNs, which reduces network deployment cost.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe Qx encryption passwords on the NMS and the device must be the same.\nRun the set compatible mode command to enable the DCN compatible mode"
