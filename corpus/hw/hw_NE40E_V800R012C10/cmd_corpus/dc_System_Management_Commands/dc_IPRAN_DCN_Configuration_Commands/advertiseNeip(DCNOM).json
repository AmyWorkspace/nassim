    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nData communication network (DCN) core routes are calculated based on NEIP routes. If NEIP routes are unreachable, DCN core routes cannot be calculated. An NEIP address is reachable only in one process or area because the NEIP address is a loopback interface address. Therefore, if multiple areas or processes exist, you must run the advertise neip command to enable OSPF to advertise NEIP routes to multiple processes or areas.\nPrerequisites\nThe DCN feature has been enabled globally using the dcn command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the advertise neip command is run, OSPF advertises NEIP routes to multiple areas as inter-area routes. If the command is not run in an area, routes in this area change from inter-area routes to intra-area routes, and the route costs may also change.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
