    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allow users to remotely manage NEs, the NMS must support automatic NE discovery. To implement this function, you must configure the IP address of the NMS to which the GNE automatically reports NE information and enable automatic reporting.\nThe nms-address ip-address command is supported only in transport mode.\nConfiguration Impact\nGNE will automatically report network element information to the network administrator under it. At present, up to five network administrator addresses are allowed to be configured.\nFollow-up Procedure\nTo enable the GNE to automatically report NE information to the NMS, run the auto-report command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
