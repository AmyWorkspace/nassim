    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo reduce the operating expenditure (OPEX), run the dcn command to enable the DCN feature globally so that the NMS can use GNEs to automatically detect new NEs and remotely commission the NEs.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the DCN feature is enabled, the device automatically enables the OSPF function and generates default OSPF configurations. When the undo dcn command is run, the device automatically deletes the OSPF configurations.After you enable the DCN feature, the device uses a loopback interface except configurable loopback interfaces. You can neither access nor delete this loopback interface.When the DCN feature is enabled, the device automatically creates a unique default DCN virtual private network (VPN) instance and enables the IPv4 address family in the default DCN VPN instance. The configuration notes are as follows:To enable an NMS on a public network to transmit management packets to a DCN network, configure a DCN VPN instance on a GNE's interface that connects the GNE to the NMS and enable the GNE to advertise routes in the DCN VPN instance to the public network.The device automatically associates the DCN loopback interface, DCN OSPF configurations, and DCN serial interfaces with the DCN VPN instance.A DCN VPN instance is created automatically when the DCN feature is enabled, and the device does not provide a command for you to create a DCN VPN instance.If the number of VPN instances has reached the upper limit, the device will fail to create a DCN VPN instance.To delete a DCN VPN instance, run the undo dcn command to disable the DCN feature. Then the DCN VPN instance will be deleted automatically. The device does not provide a command for you to directly delete a DCN VPN instance.The IPv4 address family of the DCN VPN instance is enabled by default and can be disabled using the undo dcn command, not the undo ipv4-family command.A DCN VPN instance must have a different name from other VPN instances.If the device supports DCN communication through sub-interface 4094 and DCN is enabled globally, LLDP is automatically enabled after the device is restarted in CFG mode.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nIf you run the undo dcn command to disable the DCN function, the device will be disconnected from the NMS. Exercise caution when performing this operation."
