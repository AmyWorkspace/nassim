    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set up an OSPF neighbor relationship with a neighbor, a device sends an LSA and waits for an LSAck packet sent by the neighbor. If the device does not receive an LSAck packet within the specified interval, it retransmits the LSA. If the LSA retransmission interval does not meet your network requirement, run the dcn ospf timer retransmit command to change the interval. To prevent unnecessary LSA retransmission, increase the LSA retransmission interval.\nPrerequisites\nThe DCN feature has been enabled globally using the dcn (interface view) command in the interface view.\nPrecautions\nIf the dcn ospf timer retransmit command is run in the interface view, the interval at which LSAs are retransmitted is set for DCN interface.\nIf the dcn ospf timer retransmit command is run in both the interface and DCN views, only the configuration in the interface view takes effect.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
