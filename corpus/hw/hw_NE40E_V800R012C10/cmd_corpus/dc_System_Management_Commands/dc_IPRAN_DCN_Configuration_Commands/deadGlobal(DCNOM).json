    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter DCN is enabled, the system automatically creates DCN serial interfaces.To set the OSPF neighbor dead interval for DCN serial interfaces, run the dcn ospf timer dead command.\nIf an interface does not receive hello packets from an OSPF neighbor within the specified interval, the interface considers the neighbor Down.\nPrerequisites\nThe DCN feature has been enabled globally using the dcn (interface view) command in the interface view, or DCN communication through sub-interfaces 4094 has been enabled using the dcn mode vlan command in the GE interface view.\nPrecautions\nThe interval value specified in the dcn ospf timer dead command must be greater than the interval at which Hello packets are sent. In addition, routers on the same network segment must have the same OSPF neighbor dead interval.\nIf the dcn ospf timer dead command is run in the DCN view, the OSPF neighbor dead interval is set for all DCN interfaces.If the dcn ospf timer dead command is run in both the interface and DCN views, only the configuration in the interface view takes effect.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
