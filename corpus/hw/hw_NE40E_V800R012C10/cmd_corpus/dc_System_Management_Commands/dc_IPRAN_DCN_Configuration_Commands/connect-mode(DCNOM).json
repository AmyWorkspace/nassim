    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA GNE can be configured to support ordinary TCP connections, secure TCP connections, or both. To specify the connection mode, run the connect-mode command. After the connect-mode command is run to switch between the ordinary and secure connection modes, current TCP connections will be torn down.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nIf an NMS is used for a device upgrade and the GNE supports ordinary TCP connections to the NMS, configure the GNE to support secure SSL connections to the NMS. Otherwise, the device may become unreachable to the NMS."
