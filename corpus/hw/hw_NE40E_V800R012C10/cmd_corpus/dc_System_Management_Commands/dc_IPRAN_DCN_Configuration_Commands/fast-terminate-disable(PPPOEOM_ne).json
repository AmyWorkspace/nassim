    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA local device sends DCN PPPOE terminate packets to instruct the peer device to quickly restart a session. As DCN packets are not authenticated, if the peer device initiates a terminate packet attack to the local device, the DCN session will be terminated, causing a failure to manage the local device. To address this issue, run the fast-terminate disable command to disable DCN PPPoE fast termination, so that PPPoE DCN sessions can be terminated only when Hello Keepalive packets time out.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
