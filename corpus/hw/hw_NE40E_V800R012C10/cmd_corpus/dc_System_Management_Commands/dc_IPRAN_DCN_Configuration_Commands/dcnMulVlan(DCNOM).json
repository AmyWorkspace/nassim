Then, the DCN VLAN ID specified in this command will be added to DCN packets before they are sent out.\nPrerequisites\nThe DCN feature has been enabled globally using the dcn command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nRunning this command in the interface view to configure a DCN VLAN refreshes the DCN VLAN configurations of only the interface.\nNew configurations overwrite existing configurations.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
