    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA network works normally based on correct clock synchronization. Therefore, the scheduling priority of clock synchronization packets should be higher the priorities of other service packets. Generally, modifying the default scheduling priority of clock synchronization packets is not recommended.\nPrerequisites\n1588 ACR/ATR has been enabled.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nSet priorities for 1588 ACR/ATR packets before enabling 1588 ACR/ATR unicast negotiation.\nBefore changing the priorities of 1588 ACR/ATR packets, disable 1588 ACR/ATR unicast negotiation."
