    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nDuring 1588 ACR/ATR clock synchronization, the working modes of related devices need to be set. In the IP RAN networking, the clock node connected to a high-precision clock source such as a BITS or an IP CLK functions as the server, and the Router close to the base station functions as a client and sends a request for clock \\ptp-adaptive_device-typeinformation to the server.\nPrerequisites\n1588 ACR/ATR has been enabled.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
