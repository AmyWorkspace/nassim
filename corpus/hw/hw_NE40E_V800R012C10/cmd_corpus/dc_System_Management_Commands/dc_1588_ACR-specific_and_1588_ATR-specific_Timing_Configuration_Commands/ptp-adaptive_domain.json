Each clock domain has a clock source, and the devices in one clock domain traces a clock source. Devices in different clock domains do not synchronize clock information.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nConfigure a 1588 ACR/ATR clock domain before enabling 1588 ACR/ATR unicast negotiation.\nBefore changing the 1588 ACR/ATR clock domain, disable 1588 ACR/ATR unicast negotiation.\nIf the ptp-adaptive domain command is run for multiple times, the latest configuration of this command overrides the previous one."
