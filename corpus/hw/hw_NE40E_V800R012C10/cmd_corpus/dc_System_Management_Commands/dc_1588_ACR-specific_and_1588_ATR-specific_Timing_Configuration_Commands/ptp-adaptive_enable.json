    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n1588 ACR/ATR, which is an adaptive clock/time recovery technology, allows a 1588 ACR/ATR client (Router) to exchange 1588v2 packets with a clock server on a link where a 1588v2-incapable device resides. After receiving 1588v2 packets, the client uses clock information carried in the packets to restore clock information.\nConfiguration Impact\n1588 ACR/ATR and 1588v2 are mutually exclusive. Before the 1588 ACR/ATR is enabled, the 1588v2 must be disabled. After the 1588 ACR/ATR is enabled, the 1588v2 functions no long take effect.\nFollow-up Procedure\nUnicast negotiation has been enabled and its parameters have been set on a clock server and a client.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe ptp-adaptive enable command needs to be run on both a clock server and a client before they perform 1588 ACR/ATR clock/time synchronization.\nOven controlled crystal oscillator does not support ACR."
