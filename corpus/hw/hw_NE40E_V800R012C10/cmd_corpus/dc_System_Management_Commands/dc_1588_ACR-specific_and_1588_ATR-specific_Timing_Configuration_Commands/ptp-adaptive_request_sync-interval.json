    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSync packets are used to transmit clock information between a server and a client.\nPrerequisites\n1588 ACR/ATR has been enabled.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the ptp-adaptive request sync-interval command is run for multiple times, the latest configuration of this command overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThis command is used on clients only.\nThis configuration needs to be performed before enabling unicast negotiation. If this configuration needs to be modified, disable unicast negotiation first."
