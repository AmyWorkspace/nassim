A user firewall filters packets based on that port number.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nPrecautions\nIf this command is the first NTP configuration command, the system automatically adds the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command in the configuration file to disable the NTP service. To enable the NTP service, run the undo ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command. If this command is the last NTP configuration command to be deleted, the system automatically deletes the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command from the configuration file."
