    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ntp-service max-distance command is used on the client side for NTP to calculate the synchronization distance to each NTP server. After the calculation is complete, NTP compares the synchronization distance with the maximum synchronization distance threshold. If the synchronization distance exceeds the threshold, the client will not consider the associated server for clock synchronization.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nPrecautions\nIf this command is the first NTP configuration command, the system automatically adds the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command in the configuration file to disable the NTP service. To enable the NTP service, run the undo ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command. If this command is the last NTP configuration command to be deleted, the system automatically deletes the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command from the configuration file."
