    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can configure a device to determine whether NTP multicast packets need to be sent through an existing interface to a configured multicast group address or not. Based on this, the local device acts as multicast server and sends multicast messages periodically for time synchronization to multicast clients.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nPrecautions\nIf this command is the first NTP configuration command, the system automatically adds the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command in the configuration file to disable the NTP service. To enable the NTP service, run the undo ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command. If this command is the last NTP configuration command to be deleted, the system automatically deletes the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command from the configuration file.\nOn an IPv6 network, multiple primary IPv6 addresses can be configured on the source interface. The system by default uses the most recently updated IPv6 address as the source address of the NTP multicast server. To ensure that the server can properly receive and process packets from a client, set this address as the source address listened by the NTP server."
