    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a device does not need to synchronize with an external clock or provide the reference clock source for the external clock, to disable an interface connected to the external device from receiving NTP packets, run the ntp-service ipv6 in-interface disable command.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nPrecautions\nIf this command is the first NTP configuration command, the system automatically adds the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command in the configuration file to disable the NTP service. To enable the NTP service, run the undo ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command. If this command is the last NTP configuration command to be deleted, the system automatically deletes the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command from the configuration file."
