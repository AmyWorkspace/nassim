    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nFor networks with high requirements on security, running this command and enabling password strength check on NTP identity authentication is highly recommended.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nPrecautions\nIf this command is the first NTP configuration command, the system automatically adds the ntp-service server disable or ntp-service ipv6 server disable command in the configuration file to disable the NTP service. To enable the NTP service, run the undo ntp-service server disable or undo ntp-service ipv6 server disable command. If this command is the last NTP configuration command to be deleted, the system automatically deletes the ntp-service server disable or ntp-service ipv6 server disable command from the configuration file. Disabling the key strength check function causes security risks. Therefore, you are advised not to run this command."
