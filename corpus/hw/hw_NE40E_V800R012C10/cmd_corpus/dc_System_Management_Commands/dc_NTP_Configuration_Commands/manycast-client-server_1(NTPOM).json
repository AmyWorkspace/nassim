    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn interface can be specified on the local device and used to send NTP manycast messages after a timeout period elapses. The local device runs in manycast client mode and periodically sends manycast messages to a manycast server. Based on the message sent by the manycast server, a dynamic client-server association is established.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nPrecautions\nIf this command is the first NTP configuration command, the system automatically adds the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command in the configuration file to disable the NTP service. To enable the NTP service, run the undo ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command. If this command is the last NTP configuration command to be deleted, the system automatically deletes the ntp-service [ ipv6 ] server disable command from the configuration file."
