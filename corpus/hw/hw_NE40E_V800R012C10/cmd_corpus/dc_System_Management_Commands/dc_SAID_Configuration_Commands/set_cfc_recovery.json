    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the control plane and forwarding plane inconsistency recovery function, run the set said-cfc recovery enable command. After the function is enabled, a device automatically recovers from service forwarding failures, improving service reliability.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe set said-cfc recovery enable command depends on the undo set said-node cfc disable command. The control plane and forwarding plane consistency check function is enabled by default. If the function is disabled, run the undo set said-node cfc disable command to enable it. The control plane and forwarding plane inconsistency recovery function can then be enabled or disabled.\nWhen the set said-node cfc disable command is run to disable the control plane and forwarding plane inconsistency check function, the configuration does not take effect even if the control plane and forwarding plane inconsistency recovery function is enabled."
