    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo disable an interface from sending ESMC packets, run the clock esmc send disable command. When SSM control is disabled, ESMC packet sending is optional. When SSM control is enabled, ESMC packets must be sent.\nIf SSM control is disabled, run the undo clock esmc send disable command to disable the function to send ESMC packets from a specified interface.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThis command is available only when ssm-control is set to off. When ssm-control is set to on, this command can be executed, but ESMC packets are not sent in actual situations."
