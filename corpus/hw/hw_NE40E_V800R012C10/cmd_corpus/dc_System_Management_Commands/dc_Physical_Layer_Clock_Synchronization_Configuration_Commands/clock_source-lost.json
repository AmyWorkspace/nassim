    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen clock source signals are lost, the device reports status changes only after a holdoff time to instruct the clock source selection algorithm to reselect a clock source. This processing mechanism prevents the clock source selection algorithm from frequently reselecting a clock source when clock source signals are lost for a short time.\nYou can configure an appropriate holdoff time based on the following rules:\nIf the current clock source becomes invalid and the device needs to immediately switch to another clock source, configure a small holdoff time.To prevent frequent clock source reselections caused by the short invalidity of the current clock source, configure a large holdoff time."
