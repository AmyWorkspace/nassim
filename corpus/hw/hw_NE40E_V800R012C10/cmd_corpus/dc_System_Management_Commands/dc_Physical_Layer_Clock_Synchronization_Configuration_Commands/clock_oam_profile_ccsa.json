    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable CCSA OAM, run the clock oam profile ccsa command. If the SSM quality level is changed to SSU_B or below during frequency synchronization, the SSM quality level will be associated with the time synchronization status regardless of the time reference source. In this case, the device does not trace the upstream time source, and the parameters of the PTP Announce packets sent by the device are consistent with those for the device that enters the no-tracing status.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
