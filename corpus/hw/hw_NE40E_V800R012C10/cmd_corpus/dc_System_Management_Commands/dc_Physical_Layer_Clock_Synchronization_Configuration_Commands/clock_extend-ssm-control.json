    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the extended SSM function is enabled, the NE40E does not allow clock sources to participate in clock source selection to prevent clock loops in either of the following cases:\nThe clock ID of a clock source is the same as the clock ID configured on the NE40E.The clock ID of a clock source is 0.\nIf the extended SSM function is forced not to participate in control, the device selects the clock source based on the SSM algorithm with no need to apply to the preceding limitations.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
