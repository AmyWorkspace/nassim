    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the extended SSM function is enabled and there is an intra-ring line clock source on the device that resides in both chain and ring networks or two ring networks, configure a clock ID for this line clock source to prevent clock loops.\nIf a clock ID has been configured for a line clock source, the device selects a clock source based on the configured clock ID. If no clock ID is configured for a line clock source, the device selects a clock source based on the interface-received clock ID.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
