    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run this command to configure a clock running mode for the\nNE40E.\nIf you configure free, the system clock works in free-running mode. In this mode, the NE40E does not use the clock source selection algorithm to select a clock source.If you configure hold, the system clock works in hold mode. In this mode, the NE40E uses the locked clock signals.If you configure normal, the NE40E uses the clock source selection algorithm to select a clock source. If no clock source is available, the system clock automatically works in free-running or hold mode.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
