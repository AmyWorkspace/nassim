    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device supports three clock source selection modes: automatic clock source selection, manual clock source selection, and forcible clock source selection. The default clock source selection mode is automatic clock source selection.\nIf you have configured the manual or forcible clock source selection mode, run this command to restore the default automatic clock source selection mode.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe clock clear command configuration is not saved in the configuration file. After the device is restarted, the clock clear command configuration is not restored, and the system uses the default automatic clock source selection mode. After the device is upgraded to this version from an earlier version, the clock clear command run in the earlier version no longer takes effect, and the system uses the default automatic clock source selection mode.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
