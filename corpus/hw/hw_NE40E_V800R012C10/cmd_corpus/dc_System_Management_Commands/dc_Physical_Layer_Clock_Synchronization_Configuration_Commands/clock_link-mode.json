    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the clock link mode of an interface to internal interconnection, run the clock link-mode interlink command. This command must be run on an interface on which a data channel group is configured.\nPrerequisites\nAn interface has joined a data channel group.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the clock link mode of an interface is set to internal interconnection, commands such as clock source selection commands cannot be run on the interface.\nPrecautions\nAfter an interface is configured as an internal communication interface, the commands for source selection on service interfaces cannot be configured on the internal communication interface, and each chassis can be configured only two interfaces as the internal communication interfaces.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
