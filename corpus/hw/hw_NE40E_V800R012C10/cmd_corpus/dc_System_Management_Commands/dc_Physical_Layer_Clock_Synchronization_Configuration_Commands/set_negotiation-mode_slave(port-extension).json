    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA GE electrical port works in either master or slave mode. Two GE ports can be interconnected only when one of them works in master mode and the other works in slave mode. Usually, ports auto-negotiate their working modes. If a GE electrical port works in master mode, it uses the local system clock when sending data. Then the interconnected GE electrical port works in slave mode and it uses the clock received from the master port when sending data. However, the local system clock may be asynchronous with the received clock. The inherent master and slave relationships between GE electrical ports conflict with the relationships established on a clock synchronization network, and a clock tracing loop results.\nThe service carried over a GE port involved in Ethernet synchronization may be interrupted in case of a clock source switchover. Specifying the working mode for the GE port helps avoid this risk.\nPrerequisites\nWhen planning a network, ensure that the working modes of GE electrical ports agree with the clock tracing relationships between them."
