    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the SSM level of an upstream clock source is unk, but you want the device to trace this upstream clock source, run the clock map unk command to map an SSM level higher than dnu to this upstream clock source.\nPriorities of SSM levels: prc > ssua > ssub > sec > dnu\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
