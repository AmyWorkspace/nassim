    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the clock freq-deviation-detect enable and clock board-freq-switch enable commands are used to enable frequency detection and frequency deviation-triggered clock source switching, if the frequency deviation of a clock source is detected abnormal, the clock source is deleted from the clock source list of the corresponding interface board. To restore the frequency deviation of the clock source and add it to the clock source list on the interface board again, run the clock freq-deviation recover command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
