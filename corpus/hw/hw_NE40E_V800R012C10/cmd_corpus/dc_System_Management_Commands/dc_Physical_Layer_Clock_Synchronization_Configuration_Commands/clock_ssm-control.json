    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nSSM levels indicate the quality levels of clock signals. After you configure SSM levels to participate in clock source selection, the NE40E preferentially selects a high-quality clock source.\nWhen the NE40E works in automatic clock source selection mode, it selects a clock source based on priorities of clock sources. If SSM levels are configured to participate in clock source selection, the NE40E preferentially selects a clock source based on the SSM levels. If multiple clock sources have the same highest SSM level, the NE40E selects a clock source based on the priorities of these clock sources.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nIf the SSM level is not used in clock source selection, the system does not select a clock source based on the SSM level of the clock source or issue clock source signals that contain SSM level information."
