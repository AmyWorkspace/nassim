    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA synchronization status message (SSM) transmits the quality level of timing signals on a synchronous timing link. Node clocks on a synchronization network parse the SSM to obtain the quality level of an upstream clock.\nIf SSM levels are configured to participate in clock source selection, the NE40E selects a clock source to be traced based on the SSM levels of clock sources. By default, the line clock source learns SSM levels sent by an upstream device. You can manually configure an SSM level for the line clock source.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
