    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe clock source selection algorithm supports the following reversion modes:\nRevertive mode: If the optimal clock source is faulty, the NE40E uses the clock source selection algorithm to select the second optimal clock source. If the optimal clock source is restored, the NE40E automatically retraces it.Non-revertive mode: If the optimal clock source is faulty, the NE40E uses the clock source selection algorithm to select the second optimal clock source. If the optimal clock source is restored and the optimal and second optimal clock sources have the same SSM level, the NE40E continues to trace the second optimal clock source. If the optimal clock source is restored and the SSM level of the second optimal clock source is lower than that of the optimal clock source, the NE40E retraces the optimal clock source.\nIf the optimal clock source is unstable, configure the non-revertive mode to reduce frequent changes in the master clock source and ensure a stable clock source.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
