    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the clock test interface is connected to another device or meter, there is a send-delay due to transmission over cables. As a result, the 1PPS performance has a fixed deviation. To resolve this problem, you can run this command to set an offset for send-delay.\nThis command is valid only when the device has a clock test interface."
