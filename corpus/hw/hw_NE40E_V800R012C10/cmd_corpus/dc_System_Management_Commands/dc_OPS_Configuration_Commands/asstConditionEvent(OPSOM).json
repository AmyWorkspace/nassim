    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure the severity of an alarm as a triggering condition for a maintenance assistant, run the condition alarm level command.\nThis command does not specify an alarm but specifies the severity of an alarm as a triggering condition. For example, you can configure a maintenance assistant to perform a task if a critical alarm is generated.\nAfter an alarm or event is generated, the maintenance assistant can be executed.\nConfiguring a task-related alarm or event as the triggering condition is recommended. For example, the task of a maintenance assistant is to restart the power module. You can configure the alarm indicating a power module failure as the triggering condition.\nPrerequisites\nThe assistant command has been run in the system view to create a maintenance assistant.\nPrecautions\nA maintenance assistant can be configured with only one condition.\nIf an alarm is generated or cleared, the maintenance assistant performs the task."
