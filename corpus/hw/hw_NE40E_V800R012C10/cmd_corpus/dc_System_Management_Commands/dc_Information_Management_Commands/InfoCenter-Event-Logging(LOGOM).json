    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a device is running, the system records device running information using logs. When encountering problems, you can query log information to know about what happened during device running. The information helps locate a fault. For a type of event log, only event traps are sent. Therefore, you cannot view these logs in the log file.\nTo enable event log recording for this type of event log, run the info-center event logging all command."
