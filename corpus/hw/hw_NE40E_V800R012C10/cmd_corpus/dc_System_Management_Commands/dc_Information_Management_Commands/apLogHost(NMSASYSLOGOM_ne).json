    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe port extension system logs information about device operating in real time. Information can be sent to a syslog server for storage and query. To check an AP's operating status if a fault occurs, you can query the information for fault diagnosis.\nTo configure a device to output logs to a syslog server, run the info-center loghost command. The system logs information about device operations in real time. These logs can be output to the syslog servers for storage and query. If a problem occurs, you can check the logs to learn about what happened to the device during device operation and analyze fault causes.\nPrerequisites\nInformation management has been enabled using info-center enable, and the IP address of a syslog server is reachable.\nConfiguration Impact\nLogs record information about users' operations on an existing device (such as command configuration operation) and specific events (such as a network connection failure). After the info-center loghost command is run, an existing device outputs generated logs to the specified syslog server.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nTo enable APs to send information to a syslog server, specify the IP address of the syslog server."
