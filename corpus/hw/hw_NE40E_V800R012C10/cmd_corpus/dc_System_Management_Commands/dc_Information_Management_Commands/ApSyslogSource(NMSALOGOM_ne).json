    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a virtual access port extension scenario, you can run the info-center loghost source command to configure a source interface for each AP, so that the syslog server can obtain the source interface address of received information and determine which AP sends the information based on the source interface address. This helps the syslog server properly retrieve the received information.\nPrerequisites\nAn IP address has been assigned to the source interface to be set."
