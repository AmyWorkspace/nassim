    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the number of traps to be output, run the info-center trapbuffer size command.\nTo output the same information to destinations or output information from multiple channels to the same destination, run the info-center command to modify configurations about information channels. The following requirements can be met:\nOutputting the same information to destinations. For example, the information recorded by information files and the syslog server can be identical with that recorded by the trap buffer and the SNMP agent.Outputting information through each channel to a specific syslog server. For example, information can be output through channel 7 to a syslog server with IP address 192.168.0.1, but through channel 8 to a syslog server with IP address 192.168.0.2.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe trap display function has been enabled. Otherwise, traps cannot be output to the trap buffer for user query.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the info-center trapbuffer size command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIf the number of traps to be displayed is set too small, some traps cannot be queried. If the number of traps to be displayed is set too large, excessive repeated traps may be displayed. The default number of traps to be displayed is recommended."
