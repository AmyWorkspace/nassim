The following requirements can be met:\nOutputting the same information to destinations. For example, the information recorded by information files and the syslog server can be identical with that recorded by the trap buffer and the SNMP agent.Outputting information through each channel to a specific syslog server. For example, information can be output through channel 7 to a syslog server with IP address 192.168.0.1, but through channel 8 to a syslog server with IP address 192.168.0.2."
