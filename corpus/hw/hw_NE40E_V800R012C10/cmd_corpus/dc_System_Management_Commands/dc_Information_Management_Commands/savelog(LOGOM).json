    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe system records what happens to a device during device operations as logs. To reduce the times of writing the storage, the device caches logs in memory before writing them into information files. The device immediately writes logs cached in the memory into information files when the log buffer is full or a timer expires.\nIf the log buffer is not full or the timer does not expire, run the save logfile command to manually write logs in the memory into information files.\nPrerequisites\nLogs must be generated before this command is run to effectively save logs. If new logs are not generated in the system or logs are just saved, null information is saved with this command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the save logfile command is run, logs are saved into information files. The size of each information file is 8 MB by default.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display logfile command to view log details.\nPrecautions\nThe cached data for information files and the cached log data displayed with the display logfile command are independent of each other and do not affect each other.\nAfter the command is run, logs in the log file are sorted based on the log generation time."
