    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA default record for each information channel exists. The module name is default, and the module ID is 0xffffffff. The default settings of this record for logs, traps, and debugging information may vary according to information channels. When there is no explicit configuration record for a module in a channel, the default record is used.\nChannels 0 and 1: For a specified module, the default configuration is as follows:\nFor log information, state is on, and severity is warning.For trap information, state is on, and severity is debugging.For debugging information, state is on, and severity is debugging.\nChannel 2: For a specified module, the default configuration is as follows:\nFor log information, state is on, and severity is informational.For trap information, state is on, and severity is debugging.For debugging information, state is off.\nChannels 3 and 5: For a specified module, the default configuration is as follows:\nFor log information, state is off.For trap information, state is on, and severity is debugging.For debugging information, state is off.\nChannel 4: For a specified module, the default configuration is as follows:\nFor log information, state is on, and severity is warning.For trap information, state is off.For debugging information, state is off.\nChannels 6, 7, 8, and 9: For a specified module, the default configuration is as follows:\nFor log information, state is on, and severity is debugging.For trap information, state is on, and severity is debugging.For debugging information, state is off.\nIf a module generates plenty of logs, traps, or debugging information in a short time, specify the following parameters to suppress them:\nlevelseverity: adjusts the level of an information channel so that the information whose level is lower than the specified severity is filtered out.state off: disables all information sent by the specified module.\nIf you configure the severity of information for a channel, traps with a lower level than the specified severity may be filtered out.\n\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
