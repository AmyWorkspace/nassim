    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can set a specific source interface on each device, so that a syslog server can check the source interface address of an information packet sent by a device to determine the source device of the packet. This helps the syslog server properly retrieve the received information.\nPrerequisites\nAn IP address has been assigned to the source interface to be set.\nPrecautions\nAfter the info-center loghost source command is run, the VPN where the source interface resides is automatically bound to the interface."
