    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nLogs generated during system operations are recorded in information files. An excessively large information file, however, consumes plenty of disk space resources. To set the maximum size of a single information file, run the info-center logfile size command.\nInformation files are generated in xxx.log format. When the size of an information file exceeds the configured maximum size, the information file is compressed into a smaller file in standard ID_time.log.zip format.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the size of an information file exceeds the configured maximum value, the information file is compressed into a smaller file in standard xxx.log.zip format."
