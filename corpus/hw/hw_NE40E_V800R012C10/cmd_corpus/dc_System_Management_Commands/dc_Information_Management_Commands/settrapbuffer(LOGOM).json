    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo set the number of traps to be output, run the info-center trapbuffer size command.\nPrerequisites\nThe trap display function has been enabled. Otherwise, traps cannot be output to the trap buffer for user query.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the info-center trapbuffer size command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIf the number of traps to be displayed is set too small, some traps cannot be queried. If the number of traps to be displayed is set too large, excessive repeated traps may be displayed. The default number of traps to be displayed is recommended."
