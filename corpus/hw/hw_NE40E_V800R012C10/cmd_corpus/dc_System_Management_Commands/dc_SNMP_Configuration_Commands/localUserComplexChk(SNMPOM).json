    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe complexity requirements of authentication and encryption password for local SNMP users are as follows:\nThe minimum length of a password is eight characters.A password contains at least two types of characters: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, digits, and special characters that exclude question marks (?) and spaces.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the complexity check is enabled, a configured community name must meet complexity requirements. After complexity check is disabled, a device does not check the complexity of community names.\nPrecautions\nTo improve user information security, enabling a device to check the complexity of authentication and encryption passwords for local SNMP users is recommended."
