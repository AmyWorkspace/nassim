    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo filter trap messages sent to a target host, run the snmp-agent notify-filter-profile command to add the MIB objects to be filtered to a filter profile to limit the number of MIB objects that can send trap messages to the NMS. After the filter profile is configured using the snmp-agent notify-filter-profile command, only the trap messages generated by eligible MIB objects are sent to the NMS.\nPrecautions\nIf notify-filter-profile is not configured, all trap messages are sent to the target host.\nThe\nsnmp-agent notify-filter-profile command supports either the variable OID of a character string or an object name. For a character string, an asterisk (*) can be used as the mask.\nThe asterisk (*) symbol can be placed only in the middle, not at the beginning or end of the string.\nIn Include filtering mode of an alarm, OIDs of all bound variables in the alarm must be specified in this command. Otherwise, the filtering fails.\nIn Exclude filtering mode of an alarm, only the OID of the alarm or that of any bound variable needs to be specified in this command."
