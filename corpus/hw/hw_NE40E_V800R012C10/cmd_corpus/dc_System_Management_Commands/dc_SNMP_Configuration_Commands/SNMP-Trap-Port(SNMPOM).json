    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve network security, run the snmp-agent trap source-port command to configure a specific port to send trap messages. Therefore, the user terminal's firewall allows packets with the specified port number to pass.\nPrecautions\nIf a device sends packets to the NMS in Inform mode, and the snmp-agent trap source-port command is run to specify the source port number, SNMP uses the new source port instead of the original port to receive response packets from the NMS. As a result, SNMP cannot use the original port to receive response packets from the NMS, and packets are retransmitted."
