    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe HUAWEI has the following requirements on community name complexity:\nThe default minimum length of a community name is eight characters.The community name includes at least two types of characters: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters (excluding ? and spaces.)\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the complexity check is enabled, a configured community name must meet complexity requirements. After complexity check is disabled, a device does not check the complexity of community names.\nPrecautions\nIf the configured community name fails to meet complexity requirements, the community name may be easily attacked and cracked down by unauthorized users, affecting device security. Therefore, enabling the complexity check on a community name is recommended."
