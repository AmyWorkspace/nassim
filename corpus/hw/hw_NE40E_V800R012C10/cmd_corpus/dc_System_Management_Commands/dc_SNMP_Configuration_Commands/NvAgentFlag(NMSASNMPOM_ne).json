    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn SNMP agent is a process that runs on a managed device. It maintains data of the managed device, responds to requests from an NMS, and sends management data to the NMS. Before configuring SNMP, you must run the snmp-agent command to enable the SNMP agent function. In port extension scenarios, you can run snmp-agent command in virtual access port extension view to enables the SNMP agent function for APs.\nThe snmp-agent command opens SNMP port 161 for both IPv4 and IPv6 if the port is not opened.\nConfiguration Impact\nRunning the undo snmp-agent command invalidates the settings of all SNMP versions (SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c) for APs.\nRunning the undo snmp-agent command causes the configurations of all SNMP versions (SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3) on the device to become invalid.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
