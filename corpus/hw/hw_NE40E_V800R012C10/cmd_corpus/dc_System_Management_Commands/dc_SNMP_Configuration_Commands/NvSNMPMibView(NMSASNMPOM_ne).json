    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMost SNMP configuration commands contain the parameter view-name. The snmp-agent mib-view command is used to create or update a view. You cannot modify or delete the default ViewDefault MIB view.\nIn the\nsnmp-agent mib-view command, the\nview-name parameter can be displayed as an OID or an object name.\nsnmp-agent mib-view included myview 1.3.6.1.2.1: displays the view-name parameter as an OID.snmp-agent mib-view excluded myview system.7: displays the view-name parameter as an object name.\nTo uniquely identify object identifiers in SNMP messages, SNMP uses a hierarchical naming structure to distinguish object identifiers from one another. This is a tree-shaped structure, with the nodes (such as {1.3.6.1.2.1}) representing object identifiers. The MIB is a collection of standard variables on monitored network devices.\n\nPrecautions\nYou can run the display snmp-agent mib-view command on the AP to view information about a configured MIB view.\nIf a MIB view is referenced by a community name or SNMP group, the view can be deleted using the undo snmp-agent mib-view command only after you delete the view reference relationship.\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS."
