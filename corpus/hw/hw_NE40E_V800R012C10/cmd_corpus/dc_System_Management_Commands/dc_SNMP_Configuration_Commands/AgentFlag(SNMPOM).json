    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the SNMP agent function, run the snmp-agent command. The SNMP agent is an agent process on a device on the network. The SNMP agent maintains managed network devices by responding to NMS requests and reporting management data to the NMS. To configure SNMP on a device, the SNMP agent must be enabled.\nThe snmp-agent command opens SNMP port 161 for both IPv4 and IPv6 if the port is not opened.\nConfiguration Impact\nRunning the undo snmp-agent command causes the configurations of all SNMP versions (SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3) on the device to become invalid.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
