    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA TLV is the basic information unit of an LLDPDU. A device encapsulates information about its main capabilities, management address, device ID, and interface ID into TLVs, encapsulates multiple TLVs into an LLDPDU, and encapsulates an LLDPDU into an LLDP packet. A device exchanges information with neighbors using LLDP packets. During the process of exchanging LLDP packets between devices, the LLDPDU encapsulated in an LLDP packet carries various TLVs as needed. A device sends its status information and receives neighbor status information based on these different TLVs.\nTLVs that can be encapsulated into an LLDPDU include basic TLVs, TLVs defined by IEEE 802.1, TLVs defined by IEEE 802.3.\nBasic TLVs implement basic LLDP functions. In addition to optional management-address, port-description, system-capability, system-description, and system-name TLVs, basic TLVs include four mandatory TLVs that must be encapsulated into an LLDPDU to be advertised. For details, see \"LLDP Feature Description\" in \"VRP Feature Description - System Management\".TLVs defined by IEEE 802.1, TLVs defined by IEEE 802.3 are optional TLVs used to enhance the LLDP function. Determine whether to encapsulate these TLVs into LLDPDUs for advertisement as needed.\n\nPrerequisites\nLLDP has been enabled globally using the lldp enable command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nWhen configuring a device to advertise basic TLVs, TLVs defined by IEEE 802.1, and TLVs defined by IEEE 802.3:\nIf you configure the all parameter, all optional TLVs of the same type will be advertised.If you do not configure the all parameter, only one optional TLV of the same type can be configured and advertised at a time. You can configure the device repeatedly to advertise multiple optional TLVs of different types.\nA POS interface can advertise only basic TLVs.\nLLDP becomes invalid after the link-protocol fr command is configured on a POS interface."
