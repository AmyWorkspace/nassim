    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a CU separation scenario, the controller and forwarders communicate through control channels. The control channels can be established using various protocols. Currently, the VRP uses the CUSP protocol to establish the control channels. To configure a CUSP connection as a control channel between a forwarder and controller, run the cusp agent command.\nThis command is delivered by the vBRAS-CP to the vBRAS-UP.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the transport-address command to configure a local IP address for the CUSP connection.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nIf the undo cusp agent command is run, all configurations in the CUSP forwarder view are deleted."
