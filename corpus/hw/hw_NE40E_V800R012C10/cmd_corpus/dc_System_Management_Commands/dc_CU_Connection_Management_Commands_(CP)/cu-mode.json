    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the CUPS scenario, to configure the BRAS service of a UP on the vBRAS-CP, run the cu-mode command to report the specified interface of the UP to the vBRAS-CP.\nThis command is delivered by the vBRAS-CP to the vBRAS-UP.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nWhen the cu-mode command is configured, the type-ahead function does not take effect for commands that are mutually exclusive with the cu-mode command in the interface view. If the UP enters the interface view and the CP delivers the undo access-type command configuration through the southbound NETCONF channel or delivers the cu-mode access-type layer3 command configuration to override the cu-mode command configuration, the UP must exit and then re-enter the interface view to allow the type-ahead function to take effect for commands that are mutually exclusive with the cu-mode command."
