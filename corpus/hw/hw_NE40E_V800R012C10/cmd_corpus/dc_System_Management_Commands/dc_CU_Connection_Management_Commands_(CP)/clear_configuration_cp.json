    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn CU separation scenarios, the configuration delivered from the vBRAS-CP exists on the UP. When the UP functions as a common router, this command is used to clear the vBRAS-CP-to-UP configuration. This command fails to be executed on the UP if the size of the vBRAS-CP-to-UP configuration exceeds 4K.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.The command execution time depends on the size of the vBRAS-CP-to-UP configuration, device memory, and CPU frequency. If the configuration size is large, you are advised to change the configuration file to clear the vBRAS-CP-to-UP configuration. This prevents high CPU usage and large memory caused by too long command execution."
