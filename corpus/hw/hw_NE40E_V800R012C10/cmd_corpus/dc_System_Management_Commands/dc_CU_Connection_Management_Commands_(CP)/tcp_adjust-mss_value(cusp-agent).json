    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn CU separation scenarios, CUSP packets are transmitted over TCP. You can run the tcp adjust-mss command to adjust the MSS value of CUSP packets to prevent TCP packets from being fragmented on intermediate links and improve transmission performance.\nPrecautions\nThe tcp adjust-mss command is delivered to the UP from CP, so it can not be configured, modified or deleted on the UP side."
