    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn a CU separation scenario, the controller and forwarders communicate through CUSP channels. In this case, you need to run the controller-ip command to configure a controller-side IP address for the CUSP channel to be connected to a forwarder.\nThis command is delivered by the vBRAS-CP to the vBRAS-UP.\nPrerequisites\nThe CUSP forwarder view has been displayed by running the cusp agent command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the controller-ip command is run on a forwarder, the forwarder and the controller establish a TCP connection for CUSP exchanges.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nAfter the undo controller-ip command is run, the related CUSP session is interrupted.\nA maximum of two controller-side IP addresses can be configured."
