    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the threshold alarm function for a performance statistics task, run the threshold-alarm enable command. Then the system periodically monitors the device running status and sends an alarm to an NMS if a performance counter reaches the alarm trigger value and sends a clear alarm to the NMS if the performance counter falls below the alarm clear value. For example, when the system monitors the CPU usage, the system sends an alarm if the CPU usage reaches 80% and sends a clear alarm if the CPU usage falls below 50%.\nThe threshold alarm function allows users to obtain the device running status in time, improving maintenance efficiency.\nPrerequisites\nA performance statistics task has been created using the statistics-tasktask-name command."
