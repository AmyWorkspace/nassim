    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA specific performance statistics collection interval is set for each performance statistics task. After the performance statistics collection interval is set, bind an instance to the performance statistics task and enable statistics counter measurement so that the system can collect performance statistics at the specified interval. If the statistics interval is set to a small value, the obtained performance statistics are more accurate, but more system resources are consumed.\nAfter the performance statistics collection interval is set using the statistics-cycle command, the system collects performance statistics at the specified interval. The set interval takes effect for all statistics counters of instances of a specified type.\nPrerequisites\nThe performance statistics function has been enabled using the statistics enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nRunning the\nstatistics-cycle command in the performance statistics task view has the following impacts:\nPerformance statistics of the performance statistics task are deleted.The default interval at which the system generates performance statistics files is used. In the case of a short statistics collection interval, the system generates a performance statistics file every four performance statistics collection intervals; in the case of a long statistics collection interval, the system generates a performance statistics file every one performance statistics collection interval."
