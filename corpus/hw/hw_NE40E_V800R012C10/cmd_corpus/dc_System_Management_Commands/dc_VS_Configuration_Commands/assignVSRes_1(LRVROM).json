    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo assign CPU weight to a resource template, run the resource cpu weight command. If a VS is created using the resource template, CPU weight is automatically set for the VS.\nYou can specify resource specifications for the resource template and assign the resource template to the VS in order to assign resources in batches to the VS. This improves the flexibility of VS resource management. It also improves the usability and security of VSs so that other VSs can still be used when one VS is attacked.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
