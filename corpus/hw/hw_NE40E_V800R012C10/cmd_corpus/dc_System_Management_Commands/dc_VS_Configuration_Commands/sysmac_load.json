    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn multi-VS scenarios, each VS requires a MAC address. By default, multiple MAC addresses have been loaded on the main control board when a device is delivered. If a message indicating that MAC addresses are insufficient when you create a VS, run the sysmac load command to load a MAC address for the new VS.\nPrecautions\nThe command is an overriding one. You can run the command several times to load MAC addresses for VSs; however, only the last configuration takes effect.\nGenerally, the file for loading MAC addresses for multiple VSs is, by default, saved in the root directory on the CF card. If a file for loading MAC addresses assigned to multiple VSs does not exist in the root directory on the CF card, contact Huawei technical support personnel."
