    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, if you run the switch virtual-system command to switch from an admin VS to a service VS, the command line prompt of the service VS consists of the system names of both the admin and service VSs. When you switch from Admin-VS to VSn, if the system name configured for the admin or service VS is too long, the command line prompt of the service VS is also long. In this case, you can run the combined-sysname disable command to disable the command line prompt of the service VS from carrying the system name of the admin VS, simplifying the command line prompt of the service VS.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
