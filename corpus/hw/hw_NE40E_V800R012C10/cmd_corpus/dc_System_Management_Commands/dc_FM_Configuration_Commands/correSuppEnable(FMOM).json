    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a network or device is working unstably, the device generates many alarms and sends them to an NMS, which deteriorates NMS performance after the NMS receives the alarms. To suppress correlative alarms to be sent to the NMS, run the alarm correlation-suppress enable target-host command to enable NMS-based correlative alarm suppression.\nPrerequisite\nThe correlation-analyze enable command has been used in the alarm view to enable alarm correlation analysis.\nPrerequisites\nThe correlation-analyze enable command has been used in the alarm view to enable alarm correlation analysis."
