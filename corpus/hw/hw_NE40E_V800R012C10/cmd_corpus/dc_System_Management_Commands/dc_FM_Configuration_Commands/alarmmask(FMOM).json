    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can run the mask name command to filter out alarms that you are not concerned about. You need to create an alarm filtering table before configuring an alarm filtering table.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the mask name command is run, if the specified alarm filtering table does not exist, the system creates one and the relevant view is displayed; if the specified alarm filtering table exists, the table view is displayed.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAlarms to be filtered out or alarm attributes, such as the alarm severity, alarm time, alarm-relevant feature, are defined in the created alarm filtering table. After the alarm filtering table is bound to a terminal, alarms reported from the terminal are to be filtered out. The alarms that match the entries in the alarm filtering table are not reported."
