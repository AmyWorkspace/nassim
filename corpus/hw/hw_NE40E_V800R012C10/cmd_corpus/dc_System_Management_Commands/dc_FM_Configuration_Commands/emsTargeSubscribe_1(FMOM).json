    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable the router to send alarms to an NMS host, run the alarm snmp target-host command. After the alarm snmp target-host command is used, the system sends alarms to the NMS host named host-name. If you do not need to view alarms, run the undo alarm snmp target-host command to disable the system from sending alarms to the NMS host named host-name.\nPrerequisites\nNMS hosts have been configured. You can run the display snmp-agent target-host command to query the existing NMS hosts for alarm configuration using the host name.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the undo alarm snmp target-host command is run, alarms generated on the Router cannot be sent to the relevant NMS host.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo alarm snmp target-host command will disable the NMS host from being notified of a fault immediately. Therefore, exercise caution when running this command. If the undo alarm snmp target-host command is run temporarily, for example, in Router maintenance, run the alarm snmp target-host command immediately when the undo alarm snmp target-host command is not required."
