    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe system components are backed up in batches in the master/slave main control board scenario. If the batch backup is not complete 5 minutes before the batch backup timeout period expires, an alarm is reported. If the batch backup is not complete within the timeout period, the slave main control board resets. Without this configuration, the timeout period for batch backup is 60 minutes, and the slave main control board is not restarted. If the configuration exists, the configured time is used as the batch backup timeout interval, and the slave main control board will be reset after batch backup times out."
