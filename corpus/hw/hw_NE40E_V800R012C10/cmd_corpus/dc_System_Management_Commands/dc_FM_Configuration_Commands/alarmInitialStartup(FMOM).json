    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAlarms generated due to interface or protocol status changes are cleared after the system is reset. The alarms are not reported again. A status change alarm is triggered only when the status changes. For example, an alarm is triggered when the status of an interface changes from Up to Down. If the device is restarted in this case, the interface status is still Down after the restart, but the alarm generated before the restart is cleared. As a result, the alarm cannot be found on the device. To enable the device to report the alarm again after the system reset, run the alarm alarm-name initial-startup enable command to enable alarm status re-check."
