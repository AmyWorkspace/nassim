The device can also switch back to the common mode and use the resources in the common license file.\nPrecautions\nSwitching to the cloud mode, make sure that there is no actived license file on the device or that the actived license file has been revoked.\nSwitching to the common mode, make sure that there is no cloud license assigned to the device or that the assigned license resources have been revoked."
