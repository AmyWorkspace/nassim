If the master/slave control board switchover has been completed during an ISSU, but the device has not been logged in to within the specified connection timeout period, the system automatically rolls back to the pre-upgrade state.\nBefore performing a master/slave control board switchover, you can run this command to modify the device connection timeout period.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
