    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the current license file on a device expires or feature speculations of a device need to be expanded, you can run the license active command to change and activate the license file.\nPre-configuration Tasks\nUploading the new license file to the master main control boards.\nPrerequisites\nUploading the new license file to the AMB\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen you activate a license file for the first time, run this command to simply activate the license file.\nIf a new license file needs to be used to replace an activated license file and the number of license items or resources in the new license file is less than that in the original license file, authorization for the missing services becomes invalid immediately or becomes invalid after the board or device restarts.\nIn the scenario where a commercial license replaces a non-commercial license, if you combine the commercial and non-commercial licenses when downloading the commercial license, the trial license items in the non-commercial license can still be used until the trial license items expire. If you choose not to combine the commercial and non-commercial licenses, authorization that is contained in the non-commercial license but not contained in the commercial license becomes invalid immediately, or becomes invalid after the board or device is restarted.\nFollow-up Procedure\nBefore the device restart, the system records the license file that has been activated for the next startup. This ensures that the license file remains identical before and after the device restart.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.\nThe extension of the license file must be .dat .xml or .zip. The license file must be saved in the root directory on the storage device.If the specification of the running license file is higher than the license file to be activated (for example, a function has been authorized on the running license file, not the target license file, or the specification of a resource item is lower in the target license file), the system prompts you to confirm whether to activate the license file.The system supports only the license file for a single device, not the license file for the network.\nThe license file for a single device enables some features to be implemented on a device; the license file for the network requires that a device obtain the permission of some features from a server."
