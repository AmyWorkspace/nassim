    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe issu abort command aborts an ISSU. The issu abort command can be executed to abort an ISSU only when rollback-timer is specified in the issu start command and the issu start phase is over (you can run the display issu state command to check it, and the issu start is finished).\nConfiguration Impact\nThe issu abort command can be executed only after rollback-timer is specified in the issu start command and before the issu confirm command. After the issu abort command is executed, the system will roll back to the old version and clear all temporary files of the new version.\nPrecautions\nServices will be interrupted if the entire device is restarted after the ISSU is aborted. The old version is used after the restart.\nAfter the issu confirm command is executed, the issu abort command cannot be used to abort the ISSU.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
