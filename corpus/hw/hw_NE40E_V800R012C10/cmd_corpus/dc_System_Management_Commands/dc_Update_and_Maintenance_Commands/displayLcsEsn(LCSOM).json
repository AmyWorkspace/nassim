Otherwise, the new license file cannot be activated.\nPrerequisites\nThe ESN, which is the unique identifier of a device component (for example, a main control board and an interface board), must be obtained and specified before you apply for a license file.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
