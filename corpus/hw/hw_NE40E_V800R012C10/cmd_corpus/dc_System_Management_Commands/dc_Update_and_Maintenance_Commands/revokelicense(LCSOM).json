    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA license is a certificate file. Users can apply for, update, and activate license files to obtain required permissions.\nIf new devices are deployed, you can purchase new licenses as required to enable license-controlled features and functions on the devices. This reduces purchase costs. If the capacities of the existing devices are expanded, you can apply for new licenses to support larger capacities and support existing functions.\nGenerally, you need to update the license file in the following scenarios to ensure the performance of the device:\nA new feature needs to be added to the device.The performance of the device needs to be optimized.The current version needs to be debugged.\nBefore updating a license file, run the license revoke to revoke the license file on the device. Then, the device returns an invalidation code. The invalidation code indicates that the license key is invalid and a new license file can be applied for.\n\nPrecautions\nWhen the existing license file which is activated is about to expire, the user needs to reapply for a new license file, and then upgrades and activates the license file. Otherwise, the license file will become ineffective when the validity period expires. As a result, functional modules are disabled, which may interrupt services. Therefore, apply for a new license file and activate it before it expires.\nAfter the license revoke command is executed, the services associated with the license are not disabled immediately. Instead, the grace period starts. In this case, apply for and activate the license as soon as possible.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
