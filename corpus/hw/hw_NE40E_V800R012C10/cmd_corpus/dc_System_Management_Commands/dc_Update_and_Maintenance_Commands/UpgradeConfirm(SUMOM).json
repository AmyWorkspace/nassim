    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the issu start command with rollback-timer is executed and the issu start phase is over (you can run the display issu state command to check it, and the issu start is finished), the issu confirm command must be executed to confirm an ISSU and to check whether the new system software is running properly.\nPrerequisites\nThe issu start command with rollback-timer has been executed.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the issu confirm command is executed, the new system software is specified as the software for the next startup. The ISSU is complete.\nPrecautions\nAfter the issu confirm command is executed, the issu abort command cannot be used to abort the ISSU.\nIf the issu confirm command is not executed for confirming the ISSU before the rollback timer expires, the system automatically rolls back to the old version. Services are interrupted because the entire device restarts after the rollback is implemented.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
