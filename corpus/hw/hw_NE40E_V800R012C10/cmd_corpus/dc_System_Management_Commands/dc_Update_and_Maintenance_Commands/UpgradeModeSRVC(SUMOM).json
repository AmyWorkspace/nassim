    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo configure an ISSU mode on the device, run the issu mode command.\nThe issu mode { process-switchover | board-reset-by-chassis } command can be run only in a cluster scenario. If you perform operations (for example, device restart, switchover, and removal of a main control board) rather than starting an ISSU after configuring an ISSU mode, the configuration does not take effect. When you want to perform an ISSU the next time, you need to reconfigure the ISSU mode.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
