    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe default alarm threshold (90%) fails to help monitor resource usage in real time and identify resource exhaustion risks quickly. To address this issue, run the set license threshold command to specify an alarm threshold for the desired resource item.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the set license threshold command is run, the system performs scheduled detection based on the configured alarm threshold. When the usage of a resource item reaches the alarm threshold, the LCS_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.142.2.2 hwGtlResourceUsedUp alarm is generated.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
