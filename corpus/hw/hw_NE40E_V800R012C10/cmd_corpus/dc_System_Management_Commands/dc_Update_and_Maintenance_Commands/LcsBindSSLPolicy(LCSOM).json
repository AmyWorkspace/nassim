    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device is the common mode by default. When the device needs to switch to the cloud license mode, it needs to bind the policy item name with certificate first, and then configure the IP address and port of the cloud license server, so that the device can apply for license resources from the cloud license server.\nPrerequisites\nBefore configuring this command, please configure the ssl policy name using ssl policy command, and then load the identity certificate under the policy name using certificate load pem-cert command, and finally load the CA certificate using trusted-ca load pem-ca command.\nPrecautions\nYou need to ensure that the binding policy item name has a cloud certificate."
