    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo view the device connection timeout period, run the display issu connect-timer command. If the master/slave control board switchover has been completed during an ISSU, but the device has not been logged in to within the specified device connection timeout period, the system automatically rolls back to the pre-upgrade state.\nBefore you run this command, a timeout period must have been specified using the issu reset connect-timer command.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
