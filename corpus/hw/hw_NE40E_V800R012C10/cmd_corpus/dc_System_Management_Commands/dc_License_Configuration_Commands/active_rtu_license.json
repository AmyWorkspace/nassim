    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo allocate an RTU license to a specified board, run the active rtu command.\nPrerequisites\nAn RTU license has been loaded using the license active file-name command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe initial bandwidth of a board is 120 Gbit/s. If the bandwidth of a subcard on the board exceeds the bandwidth value, the subcard is powered off. After an RTU license is activated for the board, the board provides a higher bandwidth capability so that the subcards in the two sub-slots on the board can be registered.\nPrecautions\nIf you need to restart the device after a subcard is powered off due to bandwidth-exceeding, manually save the configuration before the restart. This ensures subcard consistency before and after the restart.\nIf a 12*10GE subcard and a 24*GE subcard (CR5D00LBXF71 and CR5D0EFGFA71) are both inserted into one of the preceding boards, they are not controlled by any RTU license and can be powered on at the same time even if no RTU license is activated.\nThis command applies only to the CR5DLPUFF17R/CR5DLPUFF17Q.\nThis command is supported only in the admin VS."
