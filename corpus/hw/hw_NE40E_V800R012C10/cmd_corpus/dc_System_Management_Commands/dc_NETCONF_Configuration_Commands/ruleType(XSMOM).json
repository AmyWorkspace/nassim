    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNACM rules fall into the following types: protocol operation, notification, and data node, which can be selected as needed. If you want to control user access to a NETCONF operation, specify rpc-name. If you want to control user access to alarms or events reported through the notification mechanism, specify notification-name. If you want to control user access to a data node, specify path."
