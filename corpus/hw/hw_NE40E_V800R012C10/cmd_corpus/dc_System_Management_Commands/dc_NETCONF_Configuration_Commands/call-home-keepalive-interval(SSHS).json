    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an NMS does not support automatic device discovery, the NMS cannot manage devices in a timely manner. To address this issue, configure the callhome function. After the callhome function is enabled on a device, the device proactively sends a NETCONF connection request to the NMS upon login and establishes a NETCONF connection with the NMS. In this manner, users can manage the device through the NMS in a timely manner.\nIf you want to keep the connection alive, run the keepalive-interval command to set a keepalive interval. The server sends a keepalive packet to the client at the interval specified by intervalTime in the command."
