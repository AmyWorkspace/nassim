    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an NMS does not support automatic device discovery, it cannot manage devices in time. To address this problem, you can configure proactive NETCONF registration for a device to send a NETCONF connection request to the NMS when the device goes online so that the NMS can manage the device.\nWhen configuring proactive NETCONF registration, you need to create a callhome template using the callhome command and create a NETCONF connection instance in the template using the endpoint command or configure an interval at which the device sends NETCONF connection requests to the NMS using the reconnection interval command.\nPrecautions\nA device supports only one callhome template. To configure a new callhome template, run the undo callhome command to delete the existing one first."
