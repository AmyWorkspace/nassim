    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an NMS does not support automatic device discovery, it cannot manage devices in time. To address this problem, you can configure proactive NETCONF registration for a device to send a NETCONF connection request to the NMS when the device goes online so that the NMS can manage the device.\nWhen configuring proactive NETCONF registration, you need to create a NETCONF connection instance using the endpoint command in the callhome template view and configure the IP address and TCP port number of the NMS with which the device is to establish a NETCONF connection using the peer-ip command.\nPrecautions\nA device supports only one NETCONF connection instance. To configure a new NETCONF connection instance, run the undo endpoint command to delete the existing one first."
