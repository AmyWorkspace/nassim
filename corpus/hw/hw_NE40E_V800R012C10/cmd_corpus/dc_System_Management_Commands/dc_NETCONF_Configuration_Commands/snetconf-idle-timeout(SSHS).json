    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf no timeout period is set for a login user and the user is in idle state for a long time, other users may fail to establish connections with the NETCONF user interface. To prevent this issue, run the idle-timeout command to set a timeout period. If the login user remains idle until the timeout period elapses, the user is disconnected from the NETCONF user interface.\nTo disable the idle timeout function, specify 0 minutes and 0 seconds in the idle-timeout command. If an administrator does not close an operation interface due to neglect, non-administrator users may perform unauthorized operations."
