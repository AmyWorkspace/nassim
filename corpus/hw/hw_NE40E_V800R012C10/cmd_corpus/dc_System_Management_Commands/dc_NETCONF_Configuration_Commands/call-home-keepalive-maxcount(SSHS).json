    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf an NMS does not support automatic device discovery, the NMS cannot manage devices in a timely manner. To address this issue, configure the callhome function. After the callhome function is enabled on a device, the device proactively sends a NETCONF connection request to the NMS upon login and establishes a NETCONF connection with the NMS. In this manner, users can manage the device through the NMS in a timely manner.\nIf the callhome keepalive function is not configured, the device disconnects from the NMS when the idle time of the connection between the device and NMS exceeds the timeout period configured using the idle-timeout command. If you want to keep the connection alive, run the keepalive-maxcount command to set a keepalive maximum count. The callhome connection will be closed when the number of the keep-alive failures times exceeds the maximum count."
