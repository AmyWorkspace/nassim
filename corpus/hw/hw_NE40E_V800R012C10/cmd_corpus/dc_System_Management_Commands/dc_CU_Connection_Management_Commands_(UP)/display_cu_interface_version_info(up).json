    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCUPS enables the vBRAS-CP to manage the vBRAS-UPs of different versions. The vBRAS-CP negotiates with a vBRAS-UP based on CU interface versions after an CUSP channel is established between them. The vBRAS-CP-side ULPU can properly start and users can go online only when the negotiation succeeds. If the negotiation fails, the vBRAS-CP generates an hwCuInterfaceVersionNegotiationFailed alarm. You can run this command to query the peer vBRAS-CP's interface version information, vBRAS-UP version information, and interface version negotiation result on the vBRAS-UP.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
