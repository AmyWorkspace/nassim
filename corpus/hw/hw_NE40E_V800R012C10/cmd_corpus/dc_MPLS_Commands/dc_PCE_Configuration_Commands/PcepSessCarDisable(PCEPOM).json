    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the Session-CAR function is enabled for the PCEP whitelist. This function isolates the channels for transmitting PCEP packets and prevents bandwidth preemption between PCEP packets. If the whitelist session-car pcep-ipv4 disable command is run to disable the Session-CAR function for the PCEP whitelist, the session rate limit is disabled. In this case, PCEP packets are directly sent through the whitelist CAR channel. When PCEP packets are sent, packets of different PCEP sessions may preempt bandwidth. Therefore, you are advised to enable this function."
