    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA PCE server and a PCE client run PCEP to communicate. The PCEP protocol defines multiple objects to be coded and decoded on both ends of a PCEP session. The association object is one of them. The PCEP protocol does not support the coding or decoding of the non-IETF association object. To address this issue, run the association-type enable command to enable the PCE client to send the association object in the IETF-compliant format so that the PCE server can code or decode the object.\nPrerequisites\nA PCE client has been configured using the pce-client command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the association-type enable command is run, all existing PCEP sessions are restarted. After the PCEP session is restarted, the PCEP protocol supports the coding and decoding of the IETF-compliant association object."
