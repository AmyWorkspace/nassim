    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMultiple candidate servers can be specified for a single client. These candidate servers can be prioritized. A candidate server with the highest priority is selected to calculate paths. To set the priority value for a candidate server, run the preference command.\nIf no priority value is set, the default value 0 is used, indicating the lowest priority. If candidate servers have the same priority, the server with the smallest IP address is selected to calculate paths.\nPrerequisites\nRun the connect-server command to configure a candidate PCE server for the PCE client."
