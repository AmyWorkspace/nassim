    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe ingress runs the constrained shortest path first (CSPF) algorithm and uses information stored in the traffic engineering database (TEDB) to calculate MPLS TE tunnels. On an inter-domain network, each ingress can only obtain topology information within a single domain. Therefore, the ingress faces the following challenges when it implements inter-domain tunnel applications:\nFailure to calculate optimal E2E paths.Failure to calculate two separate paths for primary and backup MPLS TE tunnels, so that the paths for primary and backup MPLS TE tunnels share a node on a domain border.\nThe PCE function can help resolve the preceding issues on an MPLS network. PCEs in different domains collaborate to help the ingress calculate optimal E2E paths.\nPCE devices are classified as servers and clients. A client sends a request to the server to calculate a path, and the server calculates a path. To specify a client, run the pce-client command.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the following commands to set Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) parameters:\ntimerconnect-serverpreference"
