    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the number of Auto primary tunnels reaches a specified upper limit, new Auto primary tunnel cannot be configured due to insufficient resources. To alert the administrator in operation and maintenance, enable a device to generate an alarm when the proportion of configured Auto primary tunnels to all supported ones reaches a specified upper alarm threshold. The following parameters can be configured in the mpls autoprimary-tunnel-number threshold-alarm command:\nupper-limit-value: upper alarm threshold. If the proportion of configured Auto primary tunnels to all supported ones reaches the upper alarm threshold, an alarm can be generated.\nupper-limit-value = Number of established Auto primary tunnels/Configured total number of Auto primary tunnels that can be established\nlower-limit-value: lower alarm threshold. If the proportion of configured Auto primary tunnels to all supported ones falls below the lower alarm threshold, a clear alarm can be generated.\nlower-limit-value = Number of established Auto primary tunnels/Configured total number of Auto primary tunnels that can be established\n\nPrecautions\nIf the mpls autoprimary-tunnel-number threshold-alarm command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nThe mpls autoprimary-tunnel-number threshold-alarm command only configures the trigger conditions for an alarm and its clear alarm. Although trigger conditions are met, the alarm and its clear alarm can be generated only after the snmp-agent trap enable feature-name mpls_lspm trap-name { hwmplsresourcethresholdexceed | hwmplsresourcethresholdexceedclear } command is run to enable the device to generate an MPLS resource insufficiency alarm and its clear alarm."
