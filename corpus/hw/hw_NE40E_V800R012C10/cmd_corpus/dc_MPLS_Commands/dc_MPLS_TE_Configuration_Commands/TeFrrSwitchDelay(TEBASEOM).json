    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBoth HSB and FRR are configured, and the FRR PLR and the ingress of LSPs reside on the same node. If the primary LSP fails, traffic may switch to the FRR path and then to the HSB path. To prevent traffic switching from being performed twice, run the mpls te frr-switch-delay command to delete the FRR switching so that FRR entry delivery is delayed and traffic is switched to the HSB path.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS TE has been enabled globally using the mpls te command."
