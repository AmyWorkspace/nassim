    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter the scanning interval weight is set, the system uses the following formula to calculate the scanning interval t1:\nt1 = weight x n, where n is the integer part of the result (1000 x 200/Maximum number of RSVP LSPs allowable on this node)\nIf the calculated t1 is greater than 1000 milliseconds, t1 is used as the actual scanning interval; otherwise, the scanning interval is 1000 milliseconds.\nPrerequisites\nThe MPLS view has been displayed using the mpls command."
