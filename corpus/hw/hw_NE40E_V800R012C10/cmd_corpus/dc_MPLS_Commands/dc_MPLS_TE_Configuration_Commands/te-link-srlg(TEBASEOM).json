    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn SRLG, like the bandwidth and affinity property, is a constraint in path calculation. If an SRLG is configured for links, an IGP floods the TE link information along with the SRLG membership information to all devices in an IGP area. The SRLG membership information is also added into a TEDB.\nIf an SRLG is configured for links and the mpls te srlg path-calculation command is configured on the ingress of a primary tunnel, when calculating a path for a bypass tunnel or a hot-standby tunnel, CSPF determines whether or not the SRLG attribute is used as a constraint based on a configured SRLG calculation mode, and only the out-interface SRLG configured on the main LSP is considered.\nOne interface can join multiple SRLGs."
