To configure the mappings between affinity bit values and names, run the attribute command.\nPrerequisites\nAn affinity name template has been created using the path-constraint affinity-mapping command.\nPrecautions\nThe mappings on each node must be the same to achieve a semantic consistency during path calculation."
