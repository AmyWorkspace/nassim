    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe entropy label is configured to address the severe load imbalance on a network. The entropy label capability is enabled on the egress for tunnels. An entropy label is set on the ingress. The mpls te entropy-label command is run in the tunnel interface view to confirm the tunnel entropy label requirement, and the ingress sends the requirement to the forwarding plane for processing. If no entropy label is configured in the tunnel interface view, the entropy label capability is determined by the global entropy label capability.\nPrerequisites\nA TE tunnel has been configured using the tunnel-protocol mpls te command in the tunnel interface view."
