    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA tunnel interface can reserve bandwidth for a CR-LSP to be established or release bandwidth of a CR-LSP to be removed. The ratio of the reserved or released bandwidth to the reservable bandwidth on the tunnel interface may be below the flooding threshold. To trigger bandwidth flooding in this scenario, run the mpls te periodic-flooding command to enable the periodic bandwidth information flooding function and set an interval at which bandwidth information is flooded.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS has been globally enabled."
