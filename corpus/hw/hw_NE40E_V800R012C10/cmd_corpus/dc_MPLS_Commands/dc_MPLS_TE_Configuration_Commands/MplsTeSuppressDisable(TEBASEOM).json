    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a TE LSP goes Up, it goes Down due to a protocol or interface failure. A device attempts to reestablish the TE LSP, which maximizes the TE LSP protocol hard convergence. If the TE LSP goes Up and immediately Down due to interface flapping or an interworking protocol issue, the TE LSP alternates between Up and Down, causing high CPU usage. To enable flapping suppression can resolve such a problem.\nDuring the process of establishing the TE LSP, if the TE LSP fails to be established, the TEM component starts an Exponential backoff timer and periodically attempts to reestablish the TE LSP. After a specified number of failed attempts, the interval between attempts is prolonged so that the TE LSP reestablishment is slowed, which reduces protocol costs and prevents high CU usage. The process is called flapping suppression. To disable TE LSP flapping suppression, run the mpls te suppress-flapping disable command."
