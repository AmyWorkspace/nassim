    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nRSVP authentication can be configured to improve network reliability and security and prevent attacks initiated using messages modified or forged by unauthorized users.\nRSVP authentication can prevent the setup of an illegal RSVP neighbor relationship using the following methods and protect the local node against attacks (such as malicious reservation of a larger number of bandwidth resources):\nAn unauthorized node attempts to set up an RSVP neighbor relationship with the local node.A remote node generates and sends forged RSVP messages to set up a neighbor relationship with the local node.\n\nPrecautions\nThe two nodes between which an LSP is set up must use the same keychain configuration. Otherwise, the LSP will be interrupted or cannot be successfully set up."
