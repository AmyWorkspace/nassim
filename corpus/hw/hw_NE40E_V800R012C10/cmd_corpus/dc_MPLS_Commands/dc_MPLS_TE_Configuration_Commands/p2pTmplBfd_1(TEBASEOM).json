The parameters include the minimum interval at which BFD packets are sent, the minimum interval at which BFD packets are received, and the BFD detection multiplier.\nEffective local interval at which BFD packets are sent = MAX { Locally configured interval at which BFD packets are sent, Remotely configured interval at which BFD packets are received }Effective local interval at which BFD packets are received = MAX { Remotely configured interval at which BFD packets are sent, Locally configured interval at which BFD packets are received }Local BFD detection period = Effective local interval at which BFD packets are received x Remotely configured BFD detection multiplier\nThe detection multiplier is the maximum number of BFD packets dropped before a BFD peer is declared Down."
