    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nConfiguring FRR is recommended for services requiring high reliability.\nConfiguration Impact\nAdditional bandwidth resources are required for a TE FRR bypass tunnel because the bypass tunnel needs to be established in advance. Configuring TE FRR for key services is recommended if bandwidth is insufficient for TE FRR to protect all services. After TE FRR is enabled, the route and label record function will be enabled automatically, irrespective of whether or not the mpls te record-route label command is run.\nPrecautions\nDisable FRR before running the mpls te record-route or undo mpls te record-route command."
