    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPhysical links over which a P2MP TE tunnel is established transmit traffic of other TE tunnels, traffic of non-CR LSP traffic, or even IP traffic, in addition to TE tunnel traffic. To limit TE traffic within a configured bandwidth range, run the lsp-tp outbound command.\nPrerequisites\nA P2MP tunnel template has been configured using the mpls te p2mp-template command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the mpls te lsp-tp outbound command is run, TE traffic is limited within a configured bandwidth range. TE traffic out of the range is discarded."
