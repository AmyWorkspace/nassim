    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPeriodic re-optimization allows an MPLS TE tunnel to be automatically reestablished over a better path. After a better path to the same destination has been calculated for a specific reason, such as a cost change, a TE tunnel will be automatically reestablished, optimizing resources on a network.\nPrerequisites\nA P2P TE tunnel template has been configured using the mpls te p2p-template command."
