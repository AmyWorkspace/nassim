    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device is configured with a static BFD for SR-MPLS TE LSP. When an incorrect SR-MPLS TE label stack is received, the initial state of BFD is Unknown, and the traffic into the wrong tunnel will be interrupted for 1 to 2 minutes.\nAfter the function that static BFD initial-down is configured, the initial state of BFD is Down. Traffic will not be introduced into the tunnel until BFD negotiation is Up."
