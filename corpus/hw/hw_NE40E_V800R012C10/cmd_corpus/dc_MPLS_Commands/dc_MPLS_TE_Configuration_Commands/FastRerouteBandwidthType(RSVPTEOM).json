    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe storage type of the bandwidth field of the FAST_REROUTE object in the early versions is ulong. Incompatibility occurs if a TE FRR-enabled device of the current version interworks with a device of an early version. To resolve the problem, perform either of the following operations:\nWhen the device of an early version functions as the ingress and the device of the current version functions as the point of local repair (PLR), run the mpls rsvp-te fast-reroute-bandwidth compatible command on the latter.When the device of the current version functions as the ingress and the device of an early version functions as the PLR, run the undo mpls rsvp-te fast-reroute-bandwidth compatible command on the former.\n\nPrecautions\nRun the mpls rsvp-te fast-reroute-bandwidth compatible command in the preceding two scenarios only, because the command changes the storage type of the bandwidth field of the FAST_REROUTE object, which affects the TE FRR in a third scenario."
