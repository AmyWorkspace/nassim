Either of the following modes can be set (take effect only on the egress PE):\nuniform: The egress PE copies the EXP value in an MPLS packet to the EXP field in the IP or inner packet.pipe: The egress PE does not copy the EXP value in an MPLS packet to the EXP field in the IP or inner packet.\n\nPrecautions\nThe commands take effect only on the egress PE.\nThis command applies only to the Admin-VS."
