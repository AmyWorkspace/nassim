A setup priority value must be greater than or equal to a holding priority value.\nIf resources are insufficient, setting the setup and holding priority values allows LSPs with lower priorities to release resources for establishing LSPs with higher priorities.\nPrerequisites\nA P2P TE tunnel template has been configured using the mpls te p2p-template command."
