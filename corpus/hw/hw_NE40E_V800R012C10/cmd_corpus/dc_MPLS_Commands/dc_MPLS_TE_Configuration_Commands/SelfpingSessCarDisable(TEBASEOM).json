    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the Session-CAR function is enabled for the self-ping whitelist. This function isolates the channels for transmitting self-ping packets and prevents bandwidth preemption between self-ping packets. If the whitelist session-car self-ping disable command is run to disable the Session-CAR function for the self-ping whitelist, the session rate limit is disabled. In this case, self-ping packets are directly sent through the whitelist CAR channel. When RSVP-TE packets are sent, packets of different self-ping sessions may preempt bandwidth. Therefore, you are advised to enable this function.\nPrecautions\nThe Session-CAR function of the self-ping whitelist can be disabled only when this function is abnormal. In normal cases, you are advised to enable the Session-CAR function for the self-ping whitelist."
