With this command, the tunnel cost is reported to the tunnel manager:\nIf the mpls te igp metric absolute command is run to set an absolute IGP metric, this value is used as the TE tunnel cost.If no absolute IGP metric is set, the cost of the IGP route destined for the tunnel destination address is subscribed to and used as a TE tunnel cost.\nIf the mpls te metric inherit-igp command is not run, the TE tunnel cost of 0 is reported to the tunnel manager."
