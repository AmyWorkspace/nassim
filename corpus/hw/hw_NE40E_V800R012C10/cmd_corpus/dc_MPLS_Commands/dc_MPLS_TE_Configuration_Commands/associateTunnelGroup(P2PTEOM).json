    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a device computes an optimal path for a tunnel and fails to establish the tunnel due to insufficient bandwidth resources, a tunnel can be split into two to balance traffic to increase the bandwidth and bandwidth use efficiency of the existing tunnel.\nBefore creating a split tunnel, run the mpls te associate-tunnel-group command to create an associated tunnel group or access the view of an existing group. In the associated tunnel group, specify an original tunnel and its split tunnel to balance traffic and increase bandwidth.\nModification mtu of split tunnel interface would not affect mtu of original tunnel, neither the mtu of associate-tunnel-group that shows to APP.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS and MPLS TE have been enabled using the mpls and mpls te commands, respectively."
