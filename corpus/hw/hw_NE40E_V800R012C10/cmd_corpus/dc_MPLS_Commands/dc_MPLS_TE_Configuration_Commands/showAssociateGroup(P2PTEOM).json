    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo view associated tunnel group information, run the display mpls te p2mp tunnel command. When a device computes an optimal path for a tunnel and fails to establish the tunnel due to insufficient bandwidth resources, a tunnel can be split into two to balance traffic to increase the bandwidth and bandwidth use efficiency.\nBefore creating a split tunnel, run the mpls te associate-tunnel-group command to create an associated tunnel group or access the view of an existing group. In the associated tunnel group, specify an original tunnel and its split tunnel to balance traffic and increase bandwidth."
