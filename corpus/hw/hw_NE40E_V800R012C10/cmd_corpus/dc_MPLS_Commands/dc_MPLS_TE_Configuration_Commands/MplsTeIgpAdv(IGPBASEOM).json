    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe mpls te igp advertise command is configured on the ingress of a CR-LSP. The forwarding adjacency allows a route of a CR-LSP to be advertised to neighbors so that these neighbors can use this CR-LSP to transmit traffic.\nPrecautions\nThe hold-time interval parameter takes effect for OSPF and IS-IS.\nThe SR route's next hop cannot recurse to a tunnel interface. If IS-IS is enabled on a tunnel interface and the IS-IS process has the SRGB configured, SR labeled traffic may be discarded after the mpls te igp advertise command is run on the tunnel interface."
