    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMPLS TE statistics are enabled to calculate the number of forwarded packets. By default, tunnel packet statistics are disabled. The statistic enable command must be used in the view of a specified tunnel interface to enable MPLS TE statistics before the display traffic statistics interface command is used to display the numbers of sent and received MPLS packets. Based on the statistics, you can locate faults or deploy QoS policies. If MPLS TE statistics are disabled, you cannot view MPLS packet statistics of the specified interface.\nPrerequisites\nAn MPLS TE tunnel has been established and traffic is directed to the tunnel.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter running the statistic enable command and then the display traffic statistics interface command, you can view the numbers of MPLS packets sent and received by a tunnel interface. Based on the statistics, you can locate faults or deploy QoS policies."
