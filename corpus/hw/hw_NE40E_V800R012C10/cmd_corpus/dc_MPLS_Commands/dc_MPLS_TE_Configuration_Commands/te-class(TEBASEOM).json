LSPs with different CTs do not preempt each other.In the RDM, the preemption relationship among CTs is: In the case of 0 <= m < <=7 and 0 <= i < j <= 7, CTi with priority m can preempt the bandwidth of CTi with priority n and that of CTj with priority n. The total LSP bandwidths of CTi, however, does not exceed the bandwidth of BCi.\nAll configured TE-classes are deleted after the undo mpls command is run in the system view or the undo mpls te command is run in the MPLS view. All configured TE-classes are also deleted after the undo te-class-mapping command is run in the system view to delete a TE-class mapping table."
