    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPhysical links over which a TE tunnel is established may also transmit traffic of other TE tunnels, non-CR-LSP traffic, or even IP traffic, in addition to the TE tunnel traffic. To limit TE traffic within a configured bandwidth range, run the lsp-tp outbound command.\nPrerequisites\nA P2P TE tunnel template has been configured using the mpls te p2p-template command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the lsp-tp outbound command is run, TE traffic is limited within a configured bandwidth range. TE traffic out of the range is discarded."
