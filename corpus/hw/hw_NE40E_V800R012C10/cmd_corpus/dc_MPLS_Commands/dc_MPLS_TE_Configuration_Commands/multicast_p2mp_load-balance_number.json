    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTrunk member interfaces on a P2MP tunnel node can use the hash algorithm to balance multicast traffic. To set the number of trunk member interfaces that balance multicast traffic on a P2MP tunnel, run the multicast p2mp load-balance number command.\nAfter the multicast p2mp load-balance number command is run, it takes effect only after a new P2MP tunnel is established."
