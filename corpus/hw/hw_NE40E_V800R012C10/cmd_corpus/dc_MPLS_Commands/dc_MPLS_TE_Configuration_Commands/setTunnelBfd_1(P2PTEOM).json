    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe relationships between the mpls te bfd block and mpls te bfd enable commands are as follows:\nIf the mpls te bfd enable command has been run in the MPLS view of a tunnel interface, the interface still obtains the BFD for TE capability by default even though the mpls te bfd block command is run in the tunnel interface view.If the mpls te bfd block command has been run on a tunnel interface, the interface no longer obtains the BFD for TE capability even if the mpls te bfd enable command is run in the MPLS view of the tunnel interface.To enable the BFD for TE capability on a majority of interfaces, run the mpls te bfd block command to block BFD for TE on a minority of interfaces and then run the mpls te bfd enable command in the MPLS view to enable the BFD for TE capability on the other interfaces.To enable BFD for TE capability on a few interfaces, run the mpls te bfd enable command on these interfaces and then run the undo mpls te bfd enable command or the mpls te bfd block command to disable BFD for TE from these interfaces."
