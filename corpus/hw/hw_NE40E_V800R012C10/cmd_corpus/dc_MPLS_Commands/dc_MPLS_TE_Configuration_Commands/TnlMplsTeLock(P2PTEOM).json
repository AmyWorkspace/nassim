    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn service delivery, a controller delivers tunnel configurations to a forwarder. The forwarder uses the obtained configurations to create a tunnel or modify an existing tunnel. To prevent users from modifying such tunnel configurations, the controller delivers the mpls te lock command to lock the configurations, in addition to configurations to the NE40E. Before you modify the configuration of a tunnel, run the undo mpls te lock command to unlock the tunnel configuration on the tunnel interface.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS TE has been configured as a tunnel protocol using the tunnel-protocol mpls te command."
