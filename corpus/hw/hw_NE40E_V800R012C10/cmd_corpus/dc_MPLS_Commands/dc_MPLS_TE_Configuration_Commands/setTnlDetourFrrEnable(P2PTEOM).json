    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTE FRR provides local link or node protection for TE tunnels. TE FRR is working in either facility backup or one-to-one backup. TE FRR in one-to-one backup mode is also called MPLS detour FRR. MPLS detour FRR automatically creates a detour LSP on each eligible node along primary CR-LSP to protect downstream links or nodes. This mode is easy to configure, eliminates manual network planning, and provides flexibility on a complex network. To enable MPLS detour FRR on a TE tunnel, run the mpls te detour command in the tunnel interface view.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter MPLS detour FRR is enabled, each eligible node has to maintain the status of each established detour LSP, which consumes additional bandwidth resources.After MPLS detour FRR is enabled, the route and label record functions are automatically enabled, irrespective of whether the mpls te record-route label command is run.\n\nPrecautions\nMPLS detour FRR must be disabled before you run the mpls te record-route or undo mpls te record-route command.\nOn the same tunnel interface, both the mpls te detour and mpls te fast-reroute commands can be run. The latest configuration overrides the previous one."
