    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn affinity property is a 32-bit vector representing a tunnel link. You can name each affinity bit. After an affinity is configured for a tunnel, a device compares the affinity with the administrative group attribute during link selection to determine whether a link with specified attributes is selected or not. To configure an affinity constraint, run the affinity command, which helps control path selection for CR-LSPs.\nPrerequisites\nA P2P TE tunnel template has been configured using the mpls te p2p-template command.Mappings between names and bit values in an affinity have been configured using the attribute command."
