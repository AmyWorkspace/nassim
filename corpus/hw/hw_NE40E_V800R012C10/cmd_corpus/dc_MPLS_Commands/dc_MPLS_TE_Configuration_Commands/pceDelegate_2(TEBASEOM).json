    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe stateful PCE technique can be used to improve network bandwidth use efficiency.\nUsing the mpls te pce delegate command or mpls te pce inter-layer delegate can enable active stateful PCE. In active stateful PCE mode, the PCE client proactively updates the RSVP-TE LSP status and parameters and reports them to the PCE server. In addition, it grants the server the permission to calculate a path for the LSP.\nThe command mpls te pce inter-layer delegate enables the server to uniformly manage and calculate all local GMPLS tunnels, which may lead to path changes and service switchovers.\nPrerequisites\nEnable mpls te\nPrecautions\nPCE is in conflict with ordinary CR-LSP backup.\nPCE is in conflict with best-effort CR-LSP backup.\nPCE is in conflict with P2MP TE."
