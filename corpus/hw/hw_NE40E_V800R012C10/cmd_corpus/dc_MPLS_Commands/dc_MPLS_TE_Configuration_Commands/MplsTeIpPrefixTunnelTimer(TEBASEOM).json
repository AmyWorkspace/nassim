    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the route or configuration of tunnels established using the automatic primary tunnel function is changed, the tunnel interface may be frequently created and deleted. For example, modifying an LSR ID may cause this problem. To prevent this problem, start a hold timer on a tunnel interface on which tunnels have been successfully established using the automatic primary tunnel function. Before the hold timer expires, the tunnel interface is not deleted even if the preceding problem occurs. To set the timer value, run the mpls te timer auto-primary-tunnel delay-delete command.\nPrerequisites\nThe MPLS view has been displayed using the mpls command."
