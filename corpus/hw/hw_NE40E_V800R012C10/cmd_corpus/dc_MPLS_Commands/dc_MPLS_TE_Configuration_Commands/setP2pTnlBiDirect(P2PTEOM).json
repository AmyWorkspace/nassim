    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA static bidirectional co-routed LSP is a tunnel that consists of a CR-LSP and a reverse CR-LSP and supports MPLS forwarding in opposite directions.\nThe mpls te bidirectional command is run in the tunnel interface view on the ingress to bind the tunnel originating from the ingress to a static bidirectional ingress LSP.\nPrerequisites\nStatic CR-LSP signaling has been enabled using the mpls te signal-protocol cr-static command in the tunnel interface view.\nPrecautions\nIf static CR-LSP signaling is changed to another type of signaling, the bidirectional LSP attribute will be deleted."
