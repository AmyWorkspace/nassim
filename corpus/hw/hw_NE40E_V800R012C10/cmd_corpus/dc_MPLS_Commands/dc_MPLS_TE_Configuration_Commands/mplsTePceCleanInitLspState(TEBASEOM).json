    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable a PCC (forwarder) to delete LSPs whose establishment is triggered by a controller if PCEP fails, run the mpls te pce cleanup initiated-lsp command. After a PCE connection is restored, the deleted LSPs will be reestablished.\nIn a PCE+ scenario, after the mpls te pce cleanup stitch-label command is run on a PCE client, the client deletes stitching labels that the PCE client reserves after a PCEP connection is interrupted. After the PCEP connection recovers, the PCE client re-reserves the stitching labels."
