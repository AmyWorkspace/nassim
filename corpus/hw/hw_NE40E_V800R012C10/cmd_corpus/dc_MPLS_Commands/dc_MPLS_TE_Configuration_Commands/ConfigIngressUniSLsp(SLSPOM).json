    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA static bidirectional co-routed CR-LSP is manually established and consists of two CR-LSPs passing through the same nodes and links and transmitting traffic in opposite directions. You have to configure MPLS forwarding entries in both directions on each node of a path over which the bidirectional CR-LSP is to be established and bind the two CR-LSPs in opposite directions together on both the ingress and egress.\nTo configure a static bidirectional co-routed LSP, perform the following operations to configure MPLS forwarding entries for traffic in opposite directions:\nOn the ingress\nRun the forward (bidirectional static-cr-lsp ingress) command in the static bidirectional ingress LSP view to configure a CR-LSP.\nRun the backward (bidirectional static-cr-lsp ingress) command in the static bidirectional ingress LSP view to configure a reverse CR-LSP.\nOn a transit node\nRun the forward (bidirectional static-cr-lsp transit) command in the static bidirectional transit LSP view to configure a CR-LSP.\nRun the backward (bidirectional static-cr-lsp transit) command in the static bidirectional transit LSP view to configure a reverse CR-LSP.\nOn the egress\nRun the forward (bidirectional static-cr-lsp egress) command in the static bidirectional egress LSP view to configure a CR-LSP.\nRun the backward (bidirectional static-cr-lsp egress) command in the static bidirectional egress LSP view to configure a reverse CR-LSP.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the static bidirectional co-routed LSP has the same outgoing label value, outbound interface, or next-hop IP address as a common static CR-LSP has, and the configuration fails.\nIf a pair of an outbound interface name and an outgoing label or a pair of a next-hop IP address and an outgoing label is assigned to an existing static LSP, a different parameter pair must be specified for the forward LSP of a static bidirectional LSP to be established. If the same parameter pair is configured, an outsegment entry conflict occurs, which results in a service diversion failure."
