    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe path overlapping function can be configured for hot-standby CR-LSPs when there are limited network resources. This function allows a hot-standby CR-LSP to use some links of a primary CR-LSP and ensures that the hot-standby CR-LSP is established. The hot-standby and primary CR-LSPs cannot fully overlap.\nPrerequisites\nAn MPLS TE tunnel has been created using the interface tunnel command.\nMPLS TE has been configured as the protocol of the tunnel using the tunnel-protocol command."
