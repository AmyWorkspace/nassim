    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an MPLS TE tunnel is established using PCE and a PCE server is faulty or a PCEP connection is interrupted, a locally computed path is used for the delegated tunnel to be established. If a tunnel is established and the mpls te pce cleanup lsp-state command has been configured for the established tunnel, the local path calculation method is used to compute the path again for the tunnel. The PCC can then use CSPF (if configured) or routes to establish an MPLS TE tunnel.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS TE has been enabled globally using the mpls te command."
