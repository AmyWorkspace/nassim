    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nHexadecimal numbers are set for affinities and administrative groups, which involves complex mathematical calculation and causes maintenance difficulties. To streamline the plan, configuration, and maintenance, the VRP allows you to name affinity bits and administrative group bits.\nBefore configuring names for affinity and link administrative group bits, mappings between affinity bits and names must be configured on each node that is used to calculate a path for an MPLS TE tunnel. The VRP uses a template to manage the mappings. To configure such a template, run the path-constraint affinity-mapping command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nMappings between names and bit values in an affinity have been configured using the attribute command.\nPrecautions\nThe mappings on each node must be the same to achieve a semantic consistency during path calculation."
