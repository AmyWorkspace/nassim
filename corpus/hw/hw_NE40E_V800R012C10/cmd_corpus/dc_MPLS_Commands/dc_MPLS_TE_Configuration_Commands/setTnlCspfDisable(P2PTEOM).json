    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter CSPF is enabled globally, CSPF calculation is triggered each time an LSP is being established in a TE tunnel. In the inter-AS VPN-Option C scenario, no IGP is configured between two ASs, causing the TEDB to fail to be generated. As a result, CSPF calculation fails to be performed, and inter-area TE tunnels fail to be set up. Run the mpls te cspf disable command on the configured TE tunnel interface to disable CSPF on the TE tunnel, and set up inter-area TE tunnels using direct routes or static routes.\nPrerequisites\nBefore you execute this command, you must do the following:\n-\nAn MPLS TE tunnel has been created using the interface tunnel command.MPLS TE has been configured as the protocol of the tunnel using the tunnel-protocol command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the mpls te cspf disable command is run, CR-LSP selection functions, such as hop limit, CSPF tie-breaking, and SRLG, will become invalid."
