    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn transport mode, to disable automatic bandwidth configuration is enabled by default on a physical interface. Without this function enabled, after an NMS device the TE bandwidth of 0 kbit/s to a physical interface, the device uses the delivered bandwidth, not the actual bandwidth.\nThe mpls te physical-interface bandwidth-auto-config disable command is supported only in transport mode.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS TE has been globally enabled using the mpls te command in the MPLS view."
