    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe check for static CR-LSPs' inbound interfaces enables a device to check whether the inbound interface of labeled packets is the same as the configured inbound interface of a static CR-LSP. If an inbound interface inconsistency occurs, the device discards the packets and generates an alarm.\nPrecautions\nThe check for static CR-LSPs' inbound interfaces can only take effect on Ethernet sub-interfaces for dot1q Eth-Trunk main interfaces, Eth-Trunk sub-interfaces for dot1q LAN tag termination, POS interfaces, POS-Trunk interfaces, IP-Trunk interfaces, and Layer 3 Ethernet main interfaces."
