    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen dynamic services or both static and dynamic services are configured, a device only checks static bandwidth usage when a static CR-LSP or a static bidirectional co-routed LSP is configured. The configuration is successful even if the interface bandwidth is insufficient, and the interface status is Down. To prevent such an issue, run the mpls te static-cr-lsp bandwidth-check deduct-rsvp-bandwidth command to enable global dynamic bandwidth pre-verification. This function enables the device to display a message indicating that the configuration fails in the preceding situation.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS TE has been enabled globally using the mpls te command."
