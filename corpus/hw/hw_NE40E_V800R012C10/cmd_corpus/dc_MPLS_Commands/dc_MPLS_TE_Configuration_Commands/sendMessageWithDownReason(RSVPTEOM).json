    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a tunnel fails, RSVP sends PathError and ResvTear messages carrying reasons for a tunnel going Down to the ingress. The reasons are as follows:\nCSPF fails to search for a reachable route.The node fails to reserve bandwidth.Labels conflict.Messages sent by a peer are dropped.Updating signaling packets times out.RSVP GR fails.Tunnel preemption is performed.An incorrect operation is performed.\nTo enable a transit node or the egress to send an RSVP message not carrying reasons for a tunnel going Down, run the mpls rsvp-te send-message down-reason disable command.\n\nPrerequisites\nMPLS RSVP-TE has been enabled globally using the mpls rsvp-te command."
