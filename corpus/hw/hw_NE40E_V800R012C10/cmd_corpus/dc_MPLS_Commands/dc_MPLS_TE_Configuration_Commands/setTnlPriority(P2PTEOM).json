    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe setup priority of a tunnel must be no higher than its holding priority. This means a setup priority value must be greater than or equal to a holding priority value.\nIf resources are insufficient, setting the setup and holding priority values allows LSPs with lower priorities to release resources for establishing LSPs with higher priorities.\nBandwidth cannot be shared by tunnels with different priorities. If you configure make-before-break (MBB) first, tunnels cannot be established or preempt their own bandwidth resources. In this case, enable the break-before-make (BBM) capability for the tunnels."
