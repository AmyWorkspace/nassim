    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nCSPF provides a method for selecting a path in the MPLS domain. By default, the optimization mode is used for path calculation, and the path calculation is performed from Egress to Ingress. Compared with the common calculation method, the optimization mode has higher efficiency.\nThe mpls te cspf optimize-mode disable command is used to disable the CSPF optimization mode. After the configuration, the path is calculated from Ingress to Egress."
