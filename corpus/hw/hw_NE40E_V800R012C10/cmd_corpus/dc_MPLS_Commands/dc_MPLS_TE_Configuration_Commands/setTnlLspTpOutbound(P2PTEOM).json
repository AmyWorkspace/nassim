    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPhysical links over which a TE tunnel is established transmits traffic of other TE tunnels, traffic of non-CR LSP traffic, or even IP traffic, in addition to the TE tunnel traffic. To limit TE traffic within a configured bandwidth range, run the mpls te lsp-tp outbound command to set a rate.\nPrerequisites\nThe MPLS TE tunnel interface view has been displayed using the interface tunnel command.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the mpls te lsp-tp outbound command is run, TE traffic is limited within a configured bandwidth range. TE traffic out of the range is discarded.\nPrecautions\nTraffic policing does not take effect on MPLS TE traffic with IP precedence values of 6 and 7 in EXP fields. Traffic policing is not carried out on bypass tunnels."
