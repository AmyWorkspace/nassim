    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network without BFD configured, if a link intermittent disconnection occurs and an interface goes Down, RSVP-TE immediately tears down an LSP. The peer does not detect the interface status change and cannot reestablish the link after the interface goes Up again. As a result, services cannot be switched, and some traffic is dropped. To address the problem, run the mpls rsvp-te reliable-delivery command to enable reliable transmission for RSVP messages. This function increases the success rate of detecting link faults on the peer so that the peer immediately reestablishes a link, which minimizes link reestablishment stemming for interface message update timeouts. This function prevents long-time traffic loss."
