    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore you view detailed path information on a P2P TE tunnel, run the record-route command in the P2P TE tunnel template that is referenced to establish the P2P TE tunnel. This command allows RSVP messages to record IP addresses of all hops. If label is configured in the record-route command, label values on all hops are also recorded.\nPrerequisites\nA P2P TE tunnel template has been configured using the mpls te p2p-template command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the record-route command is run, run the display mpls te tunnel path command to view routes and labels on all nodes along the P2P TE tunnel.\nPrecautions\nThe record-route command is not recommended for a large P2P network. This is because device performance deteriorates when RSVP messages record IP addresses of all hops on the large P2P network."
