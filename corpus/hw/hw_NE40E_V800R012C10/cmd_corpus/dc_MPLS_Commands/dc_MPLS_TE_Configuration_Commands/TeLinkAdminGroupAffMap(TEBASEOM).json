    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA link administrative group is a 32-bit vector identifying a link attribute. The VRP allows you to specify bit names for a link administrative group. When a device establishes an TE tunnel, it compares an affinity with a link administrative group to determine links over which the TE tunnel is established.\nConfiguration Impact\nChanged link administrative group configurations take effect on new LSPs, not on existing LSPs.\nPrecautions\nThe te link administrative group name command is run on the outbound interface of a link through which a TE tunnel passes.\nMPLS TE-related commands apply only to MPLS TE and SR-MPLS TE. However, this command applies to SRv6 TE Policies, besides MPLS TE and SR-MPLS TE."
