    "ExtraInfo": "If an LSP path fails, the LSP goes Down. The rerouting function allows MPLS TE to re-select another available path for LSP establishment. However, this may cause traffic congestion on the re-selected path. In this situation, run the mpls te reroute disable command to disable the rerouting function. The path over which the Up LSP is established then functions as a constraint path. Even if the path fails, MPLS TE still uses it for LSP reestablishment. However, manual intervention (for example, manually modifying the LSP configuration or triggering LSP rerouting) will delete the constraint path. After a new LSP goes up, the new LSP path serves as the new constraint path."
