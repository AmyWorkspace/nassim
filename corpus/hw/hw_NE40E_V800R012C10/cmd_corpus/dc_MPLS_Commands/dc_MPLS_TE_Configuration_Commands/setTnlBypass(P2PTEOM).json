    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTE FRR protection supports both manual and automatic modes. The mpls te bypass-tunnel command is used to configure a TE manual FRR bypass tunnel to protect traffic on a specified outbound interface of a primary tunnel. This allows traffic to switch to the bypass tunnel if the primary tunnel fails.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the mpls te protected-interface command to specify an interface, on which the bypass tunnel protects traffic.\nPrecautions\nThe mpls te bypass-tunnel command and the mpls te fast-reroute or mpls te backup command are mutually exclusive on the same tunnel interface."
