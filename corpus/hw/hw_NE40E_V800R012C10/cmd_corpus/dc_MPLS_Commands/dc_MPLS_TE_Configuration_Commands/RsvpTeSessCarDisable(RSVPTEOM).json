    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the Session-CAR function is enabled for the RSVP-TE whitelist. This function isolates the channels for transmitting RSVP-TE packets and prevents bandwidth preemption between RSVP-TE packets. If the whitelist session-car rsvp-te disable command is run to disable the Session-CAR function for the RSVP-TE whitelist, the session rate limit is disabled. In this case, RSVP-TE packets are directly sent through the whitelist CAR channel. When RSVP-TE packets are sent, packets of different RSVP-TE sessions may preempt bandwidth. Therefore, you are advised to enable this function.\nPrecautions\nThe Session-CAR function of the RSVP-TE whitelist can be disabled only when the function becomes abnormal. In normal cases, you are advised to enable the Session-CAR function for the RSVP-TE whitelist."
