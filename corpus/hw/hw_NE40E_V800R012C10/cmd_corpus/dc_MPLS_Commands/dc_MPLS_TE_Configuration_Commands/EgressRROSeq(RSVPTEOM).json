    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen RSVP-TE is used to establish an MPLS TE tunnel, devices of different vendors cannot communicate because the sequence numbers of subobjects in RRO fields of Resv messages sent by these devices are inconsistent. The mpls rsvp-te resv-rro command can be used to adjust the sequence numbers of sub-objects in the RRO fields of Resv messages so that devices of different vendors can communicate.\nThis command can be used to specify the following contents of the RRO field in a Resv message:\nSubobjects in the RRO fieldWhether each subobject carries a label\n\nPrerequisites\nEnable MPLS RSVP-TE\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the configuration, the content and sequence of the RRO in the Resv message are affected.\nPrecautions\nThe mpls rsvp-te resv-rro egress command takes effect only for new LSPs, not existing LSPs."
