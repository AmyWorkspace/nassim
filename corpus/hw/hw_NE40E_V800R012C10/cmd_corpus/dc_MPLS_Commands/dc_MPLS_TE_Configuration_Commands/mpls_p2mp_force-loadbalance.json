    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable P2MP load balancing globally, run the mpls p2mp force-loadbalance enable command. In a multicast scenario where load balancing is configured in the Eth-Trunk interface view, if a leaf node connected to the Eth-Trunk interface joins or quits the multicast model, packet loss occurs on the other leave nodes connected to the non-Eth-Trunk interfaces due to the model change. After the mpls p2mp force-loadbalance enable command is run, load balancing is forcibly enabled in the system view, therefore preventing packet loss.\nPrecautions\nAfter the mpls p2mp force-loadbalance enable command is run, many multicast resources are consumed, which may result in a failure to apply for resources for some multicast services."
