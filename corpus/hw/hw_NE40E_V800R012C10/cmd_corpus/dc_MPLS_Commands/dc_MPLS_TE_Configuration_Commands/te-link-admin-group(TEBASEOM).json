    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe link administrative group is a 32-bit vector representing a set of link attributes. It works with the affinity for the system to determine the link that is used to set up an MPLS TE tunnel.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the value of the link administrative group is changed using the command, the new value takes effect only for new LSPs, not for existing LSPs that have been set up before the new value is set.\nPrecautions\nThe command needs to be run only on the outbound interface of a link through which a TE tunnel passes."
