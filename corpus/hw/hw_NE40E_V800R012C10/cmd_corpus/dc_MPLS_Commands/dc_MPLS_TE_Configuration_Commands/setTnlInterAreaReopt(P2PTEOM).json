    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn an inter-IGP-area scenario, if re-optimization is triggered on the ingress, a better path in the area where the ingress resides can only be detected, but a better path exists in the downstream area cannot be detected. If the latter exists only, re-optimization cannot be performed to reestablish the RSVP-TE P2P LSP over the better path. To enable this function, run the mpls te inter-area reoptimization command to enable inter-IGP-area RSVP-TE P2P tunnel re-optimization. After this command is run, the RSVP-TE P2P LSP is reestablished over the better path in the downstream area."
