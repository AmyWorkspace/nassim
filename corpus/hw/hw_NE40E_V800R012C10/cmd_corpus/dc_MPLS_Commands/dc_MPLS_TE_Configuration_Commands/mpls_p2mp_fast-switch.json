    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve reliability of P2MP TE FRR, run the mpls p2mp fast-switch enable command to enable rapid MPLS P2MP switching. This configuration allows a device to specify a separate board to forward the P2MP TE FRR traffic. If a board failure occurs on the primary path, traffic is rapidly switched to the backup board.\nA bud node needs a loopback board to export traffic destined for a customer-side device. After rapid MPLS P2MP switching is configured, the device specifies two loopback boards to forward customer-side traffic, implementing master/backup protection. If the master loopback board goes faulty, traffic is rapidly switched to the backup loopback board.\nPrecautions\nIf interfaces connected to the primary and backup LSPs reside on the same board, rapid MPLS P2MP switching cannot take effect.\nWith this function, the device has to replicate traffic transmitted on the active link and sends the duplicate traffic on the standby link, which causes low forwarding performance."
