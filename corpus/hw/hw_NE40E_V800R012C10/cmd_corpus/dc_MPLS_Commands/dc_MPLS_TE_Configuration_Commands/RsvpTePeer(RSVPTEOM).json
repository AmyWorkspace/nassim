Between two RSVP neighboring nodes, other functions, such as authentication and handshake can be configured. The mpls rsvp-te peer command provides either of the following functions based on the specified IP address:\nIf peer-addr is a neighbor LSR ID, an RSVP neighbor relationship is established on an entire node.If peer-addr is an interface address, an RSVP neighbor relationship is established on an interface."
