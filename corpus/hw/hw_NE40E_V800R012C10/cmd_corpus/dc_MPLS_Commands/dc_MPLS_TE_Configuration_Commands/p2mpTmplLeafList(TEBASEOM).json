This enables P2MP TE to use the configured leaf node addresses in the list and explicit paths to automatically establish P2MP TE LSPs.\nPrerequisites\nEnsure that the following tasks have been performed:\nA leaf list has been configured using the mpls te leaf-list command.A P2MP tunnel template has been configured using the mpls te p2mp-template command."
