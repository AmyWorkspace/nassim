    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA leaf list is a collection of all leaf nodes created on a P2MP TE tunnel. A P2MP TE tunnel may include a large number of leaf nodes. Using a leaf list simplifies the configuration of a P2MP TE tunnel and helps create leaf nodes. A leaf list can be used by multiple P2MP TE tunnels.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the destination command to configure addresses of and explicit paths to the leaf nodes in the leaf list.Run the mpls te leaf-list (tunnel interface view) command to configure a leaf list and then establish P2MP TE tunnels.\n\nPrecautions\nBefore configuring the undo mpls te leaf-list command, you must configure the undo mpls te leaf-list command to delete the binding of the leaf list to the P2MP TE tunnel."
