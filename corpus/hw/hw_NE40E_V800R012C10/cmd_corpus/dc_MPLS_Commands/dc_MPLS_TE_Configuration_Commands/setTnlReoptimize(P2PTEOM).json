    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe mpls te reoptimization command is run in the tunnel interface view to allow a TE tunnel to be automatically reestablished over a better path if the better path is calculated. After a better path to the same destination has been calculated for a certain reason, such as a cost change, a TE tunnel will be automatically reestablished, optimizing resources on a network.\nRe-optimization for a TE tunnel is performed in either of the following modes:\n-\nAutomatic re-optimization: The TE tunnel is periodically optimized, saving manpower. To enable automatic re-optimization, run the mpls te reoptimization command in the tunnel interface view. In addition, this command takes effect only on an established TE tunnel.\n-\nManual re-optimization: The TE tunnel is immediately optimized. To immediately optimize the TE tunnel, run the mpls te reoptimization command in the user view.\nPrerequisites\nCSPF has been enabled using the mpls te cspf command."
