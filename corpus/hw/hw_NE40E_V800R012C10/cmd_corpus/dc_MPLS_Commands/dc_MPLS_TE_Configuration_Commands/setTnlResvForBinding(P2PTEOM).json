    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a VPN has high requirements for bandwidth, you can apply a tunnel binding policy to the VPN to have the routes of the VPN recurse to MPLS TE tunnels. Before applying that tunnel binding policy to the VPN, you need to run the mpls te reserved-for-binding command to reserve MPLS TE tunnels for VPN binding.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS TE tunnels are available in the system.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the mpls te reserved-for-binding command is configured for an MPLS TE tunnel, the tunnel can be selected based on a tunnel binding policy only. Even if no tunnel binding policy is configured, a tunnel type prioritizing policy created using the tunnel select-seq command will not select the MPLS TE tunnel for which the mpls te reserved-for-binding command has been configured.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the tunnel-policy command to create a tunnel policy and the tunnel binding command to bind the policy to an MPLS TE tunnel."
