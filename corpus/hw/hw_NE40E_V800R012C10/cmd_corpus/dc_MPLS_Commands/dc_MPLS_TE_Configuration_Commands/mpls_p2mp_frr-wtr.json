    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the primary path of the mLDP P2MP FRR or P2MP TE path fails, traffic is switched to the FRR path on the forwarding plane. Before mLDP converges on a downstream node, traffic switches back to the restored primary path within the default WTR time after which traffic will switch back to the primary path. If only some entries are generated for the primary path within the period, some packets are dropped when traffic switches back to the primary path. To prevent packet loss, run the mpls p2mp frr-wtr command to set the delay time for traffic to be switched from the mLDP P2MP FRR or P2MP TE path to the primary path."
