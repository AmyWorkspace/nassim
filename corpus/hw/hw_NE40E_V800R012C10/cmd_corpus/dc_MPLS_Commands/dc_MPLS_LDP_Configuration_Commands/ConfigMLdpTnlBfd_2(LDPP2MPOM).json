    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBFD for mLDP P2MP tunnel applies to NG-MVPNs and VPLS networks on which mLDP P2MP trees with primary and backup roots are configured. If a P2MP tunnel fails, BFD for mLDP P2MP tunnel rapidly detects the fault and switches traffic to the backup tunnel, which reduces traffic loss and improves fault convergence performance in an NG-MVPN over mLDP P2MP scenario or a VPLS over mLDP P2MP scenario. After dynamic for mLDP P2MP tunnel is enabled using the mpls mldp bfd enable command, run the mpls mldp p2mp bfd-trigger-tunnel all command to configure a policy for dynamically establishing a BFD session to monitor an nLDP P2MP tunnel.\nThe configured policy takes effect on all mLDP P2MP tunnels that are established using host routes.\nPrerequisites\nThe MPLS view has been displayed using the mpls command."
