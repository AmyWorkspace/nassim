    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe MPLS MTU is determined using either of the following methods:\nIf an MPLS MTU configured using the mpls mtu command is not set on an interface, the interface MTU is used.If both an MPLS MTU (configured using the mpls mtu command) and an interface MTU are configured on an interface, the smaller value between the two MTU is used.\nThe MPLS MTU is affected by the interface MTU and cannot take effect independently from the interface MTU. To allow an MPLS MTU (configured using the mpls mtu command) to take effect independently, run the mpls path-mtu independent command. This command is used when a Huawei device communicates with a non-Huawei device, which prevents low MPLS forwarding efficiency stemming from different MTU implementations.\n\nPrecautions\nIf no MPLS MTU is set using the mpls mtu command and an interface MTU is set on an interface, the interface MTU is used."
