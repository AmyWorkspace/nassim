    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter an LDP LSP is established, the FEC-NHLFE mapping is immediately delivered to the forwarding plane by default to import the traffic to the LSP. However, this implementation may affect the forwarding performance of the traffic that has entered the LSP. To prevent this problem, run the ftn delay command to set a delay. The FEC-NHLFE mapping is then delivered to the forwarding plane only after the delay elapses. This function ensures that traffic that has entered the LSP is processed first."
