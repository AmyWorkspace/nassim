    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo help improve LDP session security, keychain authentication can be configured for a TCP connection over which an LDP session has been established. If a great number of LDP peers are configured, run the authentication key-chain peer-group command to enable keychain authentication in a batch for LDP peers in a specified peer group. An IP prefix list can be specified to define the range of IP addresses in a group. Or run the authentication key-chain all command to enable keychain authentication in a batch for all LDP peers.\nPrerequisites\nA keychain has been configured using the keychain command.\nThe following steps have been performed:\nAn IP prefix list has been configured using the ip ip-prefix command.A peer group is created using the peer group command.A keychain has been configured using the keychain command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the authentication key-chain peer-group command is run, the referenced Keychain authentication is applied to a specified peer. If keychain authentication fails, an LDP session fails to be established.\nPrecautions\nLDP authentication configurations are prioritized in descending order: for a single peer, for a specified peer group, for all peers.Configuring LDP Keychain authentication causes the reestablishment of LDP sessions.When you run the authentication key-chain all command, the specified Keychain must exist. if the Keychain to be specified is deleted, the established session may be interrupted. Therefore, exercise caution When running this command."
