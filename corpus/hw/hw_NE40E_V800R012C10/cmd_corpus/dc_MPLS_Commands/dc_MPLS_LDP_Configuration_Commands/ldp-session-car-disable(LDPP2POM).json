    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe LDP session CAR function is enabled by default. It isolates packet channels between LDP sessions.\nTo disable this function on a device, run the whitelist session-car ldp disable command. LDP packets received by this device will be sent directly to the CPCAR channel. If the device receives a large number of LDP packets, packets from different LDP sessions may preempt bandwidth resources. Therefore, disabling this function is not usually recommended."
