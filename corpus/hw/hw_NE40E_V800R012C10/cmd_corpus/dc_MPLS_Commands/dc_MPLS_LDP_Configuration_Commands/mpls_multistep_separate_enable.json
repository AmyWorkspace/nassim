    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe mpls multistep separate enable command is used when both VPLS and MPLS services are configured. After this command is run, a FES table is generated on the forwarding plane to support the separation of the private and public networks for MPLS services. This function helps improve convergence performance if a tunnel fails.\nPrerequisites\nVPLS private and public network decoupling has been enabled using the mpls vpls convergence separate enable command.\nConfiguration Impact\nPacket loss occurs temporarily when the mpls multistep separate enable command or its undo form is run."
