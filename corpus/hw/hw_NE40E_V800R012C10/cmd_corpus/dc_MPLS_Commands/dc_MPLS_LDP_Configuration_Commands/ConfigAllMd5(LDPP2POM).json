    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMD5 authentication can be configured for a TCP connection over which an LDP session is established, improving security. LDP MD5 authentication generates a unique digest for an information segment to prevent LDP packets from being modified. LDP MD5 authentication is stricter than common checksum verification for TCP connections.\nIf a great number of LDP peers are configured, run the md5-password all command to enable MD5 authentication in a batch for all LDP peers.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the md5-password all command is run, MD5 authentication takes effect on all LDP peers. If MD5 authentication fails, an LDP session fails to be established.\nPrecautions\nLDP authentication configurations are prioritized in descending order: for a single peer, for a specified peer group, for all peers. Keychain and MD5 configurations of the same priority are mutually exclusive. Keychain authentication and MD5 authentication can be configured simultaneously for a specified LDP peer, for this LDP peer in a specified peer group, and for all LDP peers. The configuration with a higher priority takes effect. For example, if MD5 authentication is configured for Peer1 and then keychain authentication is configured for all LDP peers, MD5 authentication takes effect on Peer1.The session is not re-established if the passwords on both ends are the same. If the interval between password settings on both ends exceeds the session Keepalive time and the passwords become different, the sessions are disconnected due to a timeout, causing an LSP to be deleted.Note that the peers of an LDP session can be configured with different authentication modes (simple text or ciphertext), but must be configured with a single password.The encryption algorithm MD5 has a low security, which may bring security risks. Using more secure authentication is recommended."
