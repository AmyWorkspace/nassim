    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a policy allows a device to use all static and IGP routes to establish LSPs or use an IP address prefix list to establish LSPs, the policy also triggers proxy egress LSP establishment. However, the proxy egress LSPs may be unavailable, which wastes system resources. To prevent this problem, run the proxy-egress disable command to disable a device from establishing such proxy egress LSPs.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS has been enabled using the mpls command."
