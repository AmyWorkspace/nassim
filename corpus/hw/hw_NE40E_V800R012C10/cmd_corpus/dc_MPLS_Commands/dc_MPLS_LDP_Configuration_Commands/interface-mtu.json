    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo improve packet transmission efficiency, an interface MTU is usually configured to restrict the maximum length of packets that can be permitted. The Router can check whether a packet meets an interface MTU requirement by comparing the interface MTU with a packet's length or with the sum of a packet's label length and packet length. To specify the interface MTU check mode, run the interface-mtu check-mode command.\nThe two check modes apply to different scenarios:\nip: applies to IP forwarding scenarios.label-contained-length: applies to MPLS forwarding scenarios.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the interface-mtu check-mode command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nIn VS mode, the interface-mtu check-mode command can be run only on admin VS to be shared by all VSs and is unconfigurable on VSn."
