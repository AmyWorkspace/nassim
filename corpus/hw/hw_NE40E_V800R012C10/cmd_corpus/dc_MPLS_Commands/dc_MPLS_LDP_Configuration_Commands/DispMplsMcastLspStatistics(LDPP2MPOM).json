    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo view forwarding plane statistics about a multicast LSP, run the display mpls multicast-lsp statistics protocol mldp command on each node. Only P2MP LSPs can be used as multicast LSPs.\nPrecautions\nOn a bud node that functions as both a transit node and a leaf node on a multicast P2MP LSP, statistics contain only bud LSP information, but do not contain transit or egress LSP information."
