    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nNo tunnel protection is provided for mLDP P2MP tunnels. If an LSP fails, traffic can only be switched using route change-induced hard convergence, which renders low performance. BFD for mLDP P2MP tunnel applies to NG-MVPNs and VPLS networks on which mLDP P2MP trees with primary and backup roots are configured. If a P2MP tunnel fails, BFD for mLDP P2MP tunnel rapidly detects the fault and switches traffic to the backup tunnel, which reduces traffic loss and improves fault convergence performance in an NG-MVPN over mLDP P2MP scenario or a VPLS over mLDP P2MP scenario.\nPrerequisites\nThe MPLS view has been displayed using the mpls command."
