    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nYou can modify the description of a remote peer only after the remote peer is deleted and a new peer is created. As a result, service traffic is lost. To solve this problem, run the description command to complete the description of the remote peer.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a description has been configured for a remote peer, running the description command overrides the previous description."
