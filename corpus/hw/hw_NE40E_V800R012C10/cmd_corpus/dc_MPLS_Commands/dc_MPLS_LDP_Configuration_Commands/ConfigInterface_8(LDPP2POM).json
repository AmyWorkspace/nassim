    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, downstream LSRs unsolicitedly send Label Mapping messages to upstream LSRs. Establishing a great number of LSPs burdens an LSR, such as a DSLAM (a low-performance access device) deployed on an MPLS network. On a large network, run the mpls ldp advertisement dod command. This setting allows a DSLAM to send Label Mapping messages to upstream LSRs only after receiving label requests. This setting helps minimize the number of unwanted MPLS forwarding entries forwarded by the DSLAM.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS and MPLS LDP have been enabled globally and on the interface.\nPrecautions\nThe mpls ldp advertisement command takes effect only after MPLS LDP has been enabled in the interface view.When there are multiple links between neighbors, all interfaces must use the same label advertisement mode.Modifying the label advertisement mode causes LDP sessions to be reestablished."
