    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an LSP, when the active role (the ingress) creates a dynamic BFD session, the sending of an LSP ping request packet carrying a BFD TLV is triggered. After receiving the LSP ping request packet, the passive role (the egress) replies with an LSP ping response packet carrying the BFD TLV. Then, a BFD session can be set up. The egress can automatically create the BFD session only after receiving the LSP ping packet. To set the interval at which LSP ping packets are sent by dynamic BFD, you can run the mpls ping interval command.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been globally enabled using the bfd command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nSetting the interval at which LSP ping packets are sent to a small value imposes a heady burden on links."
