    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf different types of links on an MPLS network support different MTU values, this function enables devices to negotiate MTU values, prevents packets from being discarded if the packet size exceeds an MTU.\nPrecautions\nBy default, after MPLS LDP is globally enabled, a device sends Label Mapping messages carrying an MTU TLV in compliance with draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mtu-extensions. If an LDP peer does not identify the MTU TLV carried in a received message, the peer must process the TLV as an unknown TLV defined in relevant RFC standards."
