    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn LDP GR mode, when an active/standby switchover or protocol restart occurs on the neighboring device of the local device, the local device (GR helper) helps the device (restarter) restart without interrupting packet forwarding.\nIf LDP GR is not enabled, during an active/standby switchover or upgrade, the neighboring device deletes the LSP because the session is in the Down state. As a result, traffic is interrupted in a short time. If LDP GR is enabled, the labels before and after an unexpected active/standby switchover or protocol restart can be consistent, and uninterrupted MPLS forwarding is ensured.\nCurrently, LDP supports only GR helper.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS and MPLS LDP have been enabled globally.\nImplementation Procedure\nWhen the graceful-restart command is run, the system displays the following message:\nWarning: All the related sessions will be deleted if the operation is performed! Continue? [Y/N]:\nTo confirm to run the command, enter y.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the graceful-restart command is run, when the peer performs an active/standby switchover, the local node functioning as the GR helper reserves forwarding entries within a specified period of time.\nPrecautions\nEnabling or disabling GR causes the reestablishment of all LDP sessions."
