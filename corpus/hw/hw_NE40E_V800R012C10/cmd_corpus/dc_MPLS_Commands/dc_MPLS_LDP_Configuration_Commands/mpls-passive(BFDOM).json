    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore configuring a dynamic BFD session to monitor a unidirectional LSP, you must run the mpls-passive command to enable the egress of an LSP to passively create a BFD session. After the egress receives an LSP ping request packet carrying a BFD TLV from the ingress, the egress replies with an LSP ping response packet carrying the BFD TLV. Then, a BFD session can be set up.\nPrerequisites\nBFD has been enabled globally using the bfd command in the system view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the BFD session created on the ingress does not receive an LSP ping packet from the egress, the ingress considers the LSP Down. In this case, create a BFD session in the opposite direction on the egress to send LSP ping packets. After the mpls-passive command is run, a BFD session can be created on the egress of the LSP.\nPrecautions\nThe mpls-passive command must be run on the egress. Then, the egress can create a BFD session in an opposite direction after receiving an LSP ping request packet carrying a BFD TLV."
