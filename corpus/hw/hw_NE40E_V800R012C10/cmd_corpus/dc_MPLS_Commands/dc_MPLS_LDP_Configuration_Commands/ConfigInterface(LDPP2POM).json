    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network where MPLS LDP services are deployed, after you enable MPLS LDP on a node, enable MPLS LDP on the interfaces of the node to perform other LDP configurations.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS LDP has been enabled on the node to which the interface belongs.\nConfiguration Impact\nRunning the undo mpls ldp command in the interface view causes the deletion of all MPLS LDP configurations on the interface.\nFollow-up Procedure\nYou can perform other configurations of MPLS LDP."
