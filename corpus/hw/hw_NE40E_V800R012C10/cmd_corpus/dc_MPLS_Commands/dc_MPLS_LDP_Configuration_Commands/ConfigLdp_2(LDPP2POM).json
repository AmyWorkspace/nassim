    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe device does not support the loop detection function. In the scenario where its neighbor supports the loop detection function and requires that the notification about whether the same loop detection function is enabled on the two ends, to ensure that the VRP sets up an LDP session with this neighbor, run the loop-detect command.\nAlthough the loop-detect command is run, the VRP still does not support the LDP loop detection function but only has the loop detection negotiation capability."
