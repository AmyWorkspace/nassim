    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe mpls lsp exp-mode command can be used on the penultimate hop to globally control the copy of the EXP value of an outer label to the EXP value of an inner label.\nPrecautions\nThe configured mode by running this command takes effect only on new LPSs. The reset mpls ldp command can be used to re-establish the original LSPs. Then, the configured mode can take effect on the reestablished LSPs.The mpls lsp exp-mode command is configured only on the penultimate hop to control the copy of the EXP value of an outer label to the EXP value of an inner label.If an MPLS DiffServ mode is configured on the MPLS TE ingress node and the mpls lsp exp-mode command is configured on the penultimate node, the penultimate node processes label mapping in a mode specified using the mpls lsp exp-mode command."
