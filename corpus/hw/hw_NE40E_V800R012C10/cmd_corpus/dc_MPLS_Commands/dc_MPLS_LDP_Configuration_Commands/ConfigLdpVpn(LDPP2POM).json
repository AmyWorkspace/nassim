    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the LSR ID of an LDP instance is the same as the MPLS LSR ID configured using the mpls lsr-id command. On some networks, such as the BGP/MPLS VPNs, to which VPN instances apply, if the VPN address space and the public network address space overlap, configure LSR IDs for LDP instances to ensure the correct setup of TCP connections.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS and MPLS LDP have been globally enabled.\nImplementation Procedure\nWhen the lsr-id command is run, the system displays the following prompt:\nWarning: All the related sessions will be deleted if the operation is performed! Continue? [Y/N]:\nTo confirm to run the command, enter y.\nPrecautions\nAn LDP session uses an LSR ID as a TCP transport address by default. If a nonexistent IP address is used as an LSR ID or a route is unreachable, a separate TCP transport address must be specified.\nChanging or deleting the LSR ID of an LDP instance causes the reestablishment of all sessions in the LDP instance."
