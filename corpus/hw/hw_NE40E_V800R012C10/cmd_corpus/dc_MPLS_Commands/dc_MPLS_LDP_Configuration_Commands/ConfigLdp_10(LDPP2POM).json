    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a large-scale network, multiple Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas usually need to be configured for flexible network deployment and fast route convergence. In this situation, when advertising routes between IGP areas, to prevent a large number of routes from consuming too many resources, an area border router (ABR) needs to aggregate the routes in an area and then advertise the aggregated route to neighbor IGP areas. By default, when establishing LSPs, LDP searches the routing table for the route that exactly matches the forwarding equivalence class (FEC) carried in the received Label Mapping message. For aggregated routes, only liberal LDP LSPs, not inter-area LDP LSPs, can be set up.\nIn this case, you can run the longest-match command to enable LDP to search for routes or establishing inter-area LDP LSPs based on the longest match rule.\nPrerequisites\nMPLS LDP has been enabled globally using the mpls ldp command in the system view.\nPrecautions\nConfiguring this command is not allowed during LDP GR."
