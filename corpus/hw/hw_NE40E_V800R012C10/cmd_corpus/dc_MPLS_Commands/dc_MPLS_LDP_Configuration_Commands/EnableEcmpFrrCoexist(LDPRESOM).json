    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network with ECMP enabled, the same types of devices reside on both end of ECMP links. If an optical fiber between the two devices is disconnected, network-wide protection fails because backup path calculation is not supported. To prevent packet loss from such a disconnection, run the ecmp-frr-coexist enable command to enable the coexistence of ECMP and FRR so that the backup paths can be established for ECMP paths."
