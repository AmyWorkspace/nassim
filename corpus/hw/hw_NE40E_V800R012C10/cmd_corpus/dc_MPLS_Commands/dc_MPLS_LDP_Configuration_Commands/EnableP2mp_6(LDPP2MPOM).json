    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an mLDP P2MP network, if a downstream node detects a link fault, the node automatically starts the timer for delaying in deleting mLDP P2MP LSP labels. After the timer times out, the downstream node sends a message to instruct an upstream node to withdraw a label. This timer helps prevent local link flapping from spreading globally and prevent global LSPs from alternating between being torn down and established.\nPrerequisites\nmLDP P2MP has been enabled using the mldp p2mp command in the MPLS-LDP view."
