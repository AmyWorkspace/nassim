    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an MPLS network where both active and standby links are used and LDP-IGP synchronization is enabled, graceful LDP deletion allows upstream labels to retain a specified period of time after an LDP session goes Down. This allows traffic to switch to a new LSP over the standby link without upstream labels re-assigned, minimizing the traffic interruption time. The graceful-delete timer command is used to set a period of time to retain upstream labels after an LDP session goes Down.\nPrerequisites\nGraceful LDP deletion has been enabled globally.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter configuring a period of time to retain upstream labels if an LDP session goes Down, run the display mpls ldp command to verify the configuration.\nPrecautions\nSetting a small value is recommended, preventing labels for the faulty LSP from retaining for a long period of time."
