    "FuncDef": "The ttl expiration pop command enables a device to reply to a transmit end with ICMP reply messages over IP routes after MPLS TTLs in the packets expire.\nThe undo ttl expiration pop command disables IP routing and enables ICMP reply messages to pass through LSPs.\nBy default, if a device receives a packet with a single label and an expired MPLS TTL, the device replies to the transmit end with an ICMP reply message over an IP route.",

        ]
    ],
    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, if the device receives packets with expired MPLS TTLs, the VRP replies to the source with ICMP reply messages. If the IP routes are unreachable, the VRP discards the packet with the expired MPLS TTL. As a result, the tracert operation cannot provide forwarding path information carried in the ICMP message for the transmit end, which causes difficulties in analyzing faults. To prevent ICMP reply message loss, run the this command to enable ICMP reply messages to pass along an LSP.\nThe function of this command applies to the inter-AS VPN Option B. This command can be run on ASBRs in the inter-AS VPN Option B.\nPrerequisites\nThe MPLS view has been displayed using the mpls command.\nPrecautions\nThe undo mpls command deletes all configurations related to this command."
