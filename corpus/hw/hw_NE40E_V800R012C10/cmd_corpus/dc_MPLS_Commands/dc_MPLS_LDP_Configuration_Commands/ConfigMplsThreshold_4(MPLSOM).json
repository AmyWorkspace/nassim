    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the number of remote LDP adjacencies reaches a specified upper limit, new remote LDP adjacencies cannot be configured due to insufficient resources. To alert the administrator in operation and maintenance, enable a device to generate an alarm when the proportion of established remote LDP adjacencies to all supported ones reaches a specified upper alarm threshold. The following parameters can be configured in the mpls remote-adjacency-number threshold-alarm command:\nIf the proportion of established remote LDP adjacencies to all supported ones reaches the upper alarm threshold, an alarm can be generated.If the proportion of established remote LDP adjacencies to all supported ones falls below the lower alarm threshold, a clear alarm can be generated.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the mpls remote-adjacency-number threshold-alarm command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.The mpls remote-adjacency-number threshold-alarm command only configures the trigger conditions for an alarm and its clear alarm. Although trigger conditions are met, the alarm and its clear alarm can be generated only after the snmp-agent trap enable feature-name mpls_lspm trap-name { hwmplsresourcethresholdexceed | hwmplsresourcethresholdexceedclear } command is run to enable the device to generate an MPLS resource insufficiency alarm and its clear alarm."
