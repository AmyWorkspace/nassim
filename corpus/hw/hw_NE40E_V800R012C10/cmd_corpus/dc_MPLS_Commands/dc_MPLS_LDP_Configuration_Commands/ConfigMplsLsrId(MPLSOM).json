    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network where MPLS services are deployed, you must configure the LSR IDs for devices.\nAn LSR does not have a default ID, and you must configure an ID for it.\nIt is recommended that the address of a loopback interface on an LSR be configured as the LSR ID.\nFollow-up Procedure\nYou can configure MPLS and associated services.\nPrecautions\nThe undo mpls lsr-id command deletes existing LDP sessions and LSPs over the sessions. Execute caution when running this command.\nIf the mpls lsr-id command is run and the LSR ID is the same as the primary IP address of a loopback interface, note that:\nThe loopback interface cannot be bound to an L3VPN instance.The loopback interface cannot be deleted.The primary IP address of the loopback interface cannot be deleted or modified."
