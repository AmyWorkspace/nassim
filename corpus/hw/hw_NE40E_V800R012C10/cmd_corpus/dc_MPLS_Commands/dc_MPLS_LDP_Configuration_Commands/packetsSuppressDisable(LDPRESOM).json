    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter an LDP LSP goes Up, it goes Down due to a protocol or interface failure. A device attempts to reestablish the LDP LSP, which maximizes the LDP LSP protocol hard convergence. If LDP LSP alternates between Up and Down when a downstream node frequently sends a label to an upstream node or a label is withdrawn, CPU usage increases. To prevent label suppression, configure LDP LSP flapping suppression. To disable LDP LSP flapping suppression, run the protocol-packets suppress disable command."
