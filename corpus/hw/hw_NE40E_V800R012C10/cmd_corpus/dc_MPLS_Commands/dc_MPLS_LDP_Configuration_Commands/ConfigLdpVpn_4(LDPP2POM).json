    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network where both active and standby links are used and IGP-LDP synchronization is enabled, if an LDP session goes Down, upstream labels are withdrawn to delete an LSP, and IGP-LDP synchronization switches traffic to a new LSP established over the standby link using newly assigned labels. The traffic restoration is delayed. To speed up traffic restoration, graceful LDP deletion is used together with IGP-LDP synchronization. If an LDP session goes Down, upstream labels are not withdrawn during IGP convergence, and a new LSP is established over the standby link using these upstream labels, minimizing the traffic interruption time.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the graceful-delete command is used, upstream labels are not withdrawn during IGP convergence if an LDP session goes Down, minimizing the traffic interruption time.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the graceful-delete timer command to set the time to retain upstream labels."
