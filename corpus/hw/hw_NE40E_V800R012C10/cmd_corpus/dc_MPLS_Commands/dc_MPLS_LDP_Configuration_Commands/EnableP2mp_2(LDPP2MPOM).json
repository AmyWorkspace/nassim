    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter mLDP P2MP is enabled in the MPLS-LDP view, to establish an inter-BGP-AS tunnel for multicast, run the mldp recursive-fec command to enable the mLDP P2MP service to span BGP AS domains.\nPrerequisites\nmLDP P2MP has been enabled.\nPrecautions\nIn an inter-AS mLDP scenario, if a device has both an IGP/static and a BGP route to the same root address:\n(1) The device preferentially uses the IGP/static route to select an upstream (according to the longest match rule), and attempts to establish an intra-AS mLDP LSP. The attempt fails if the outbound interface of the route does not have an LDP session established.\n(2) If the IGP/static route is not matched, the device uses the BGP route, and attempts to establish an inter-AS mLDP LSP."
