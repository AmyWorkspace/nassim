    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a remote LDP session transmits LDP services, you can run one of the following commands to prevent an LSR from distributing labels to the remote peer to save system resources:\nRun the remote-ip pwe3 command to prevent the LSR from distributing labels to a specified remote peer.Run the remote-peer pwe3 command to prevent the LSR from distributing labels to all remote peers.\nWhen a backbone network is deployed with TE services, that is, in the LDP over TE scenario, you cannot prevent an LSR from distributing labels to remote peers.\nSpecifically, after this function is configured, the device can still use LDP to distribute labels to L2VPN peers.\n\nPrerequisites\nRun the command mpls ldp remote-peer to configure remote LDP peer."
