    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, the system reserves separate label spaces for dynamic and static services, allowing labels for dynamic and static services to be stored in separate spaces. This facilitates label management and maintenance but wastes label resources on some devices. If label resources are limited on a device, to save label resources, enable the dynamic and static services to share the label space.\nIf dynamic and static services share label spaces, ensure that labels are not used by dynamic services before being the labels are allocated to static services. The display mpls label static available command displays information about labels available for transmitting static services.\nIn the command output, a dash is used to indicate a range. For example, labels 1000, 1001, and 1002 are displayed as 1000-1002.\nFollow-up Procedure\nLabels displayed in the command output can be allocated for static services."
