    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the network topology changes, to prevent traffic congestion on paths of an mLDP P2MP tunnel that converge on a few links, appropriately perform mLDP P2MP re-optimization. If the upstream or downstream nodes are optional, an mLDP P2MP tunnel can be reestablished over the updated path. To set the interval between the time the network topology changes and the timer mLDP re-optimization is triggered, run the mldp reoptimize timer command.\nPrerequisites\nmLDP P2MP has been enabled globally using the mldp p2mp command."
