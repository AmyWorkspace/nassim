    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an LSR disabled from the dynamic LDP negotiation capability, if an extended LDP function is enabled after an LDP session has been created, the LDP session will be interrupted, and the extended LDP function will be negotiated, affecting LSP stability.\nThe dynamic LDP advertisement capability enabled using the capability-announcement command allows an extended LDP function to be enabled or disabled dynamically during proper operation of an LDP session, ensuring LSP stability.\nEnabling the dynamic LDP advertisement capability announcement function immediately after LDP is enabled globally is recommended. This function does not affect existing LDP functions.\nPrerequisites\nBefore the LDP dynamic capability announcement function is enabled, MPLS and LDP have been globally enabled.\nConfiguration Impact\nEnabling the LDP dynamic capability announcement function after an LDP session is established results in reestablishment of the LDP session.\nPrecautions\nThis command is valid only for LDP supporting the dynamic LDP advertisement capability announcement function."
