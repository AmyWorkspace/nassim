    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen LDP LSPs are established to transmit services with high quality requirements, bit errors on LSPs may cause service interruptions. To detect bit errors, run the bit-error-detection command for LDP LSPs. If a node on an LSP detects bit errors, LDP notifies the VPN services of the bit error rate and triggers a service switchover, which guarantees service quality.\nAfter the\nbit-error-detection command is run, LDP LSP bit error detection takes effect as follows:\nAn LDP LSP remains in the bit error state if its bit error rate is greater than or equal to the bit error rate threshold for triggering a service switchover.The LDP LSP leaves the bit error state if its bit error rate falls below the bit error rate threshold for triggering a service switchover.\n\nPrerequisites\nMPLS LDP has been enabled using the mpls ldp command."
