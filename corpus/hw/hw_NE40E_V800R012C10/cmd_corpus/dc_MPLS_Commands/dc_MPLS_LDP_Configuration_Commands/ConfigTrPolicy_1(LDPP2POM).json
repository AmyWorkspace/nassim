    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA device by default forwards the overlapping part of unknown TLVs of established downstream mappings to upstream devices. Consequently, upon receipt of such TLV information, an upstream device cannot handle the unknown TLV information, which causes problems. To prevent the problems, run the propagate mapping unknown-tlv disable command on the local device to disable this device from forwarding unknown TLV information to the upstream device."
