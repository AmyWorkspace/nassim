    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nUsually the devices at the edge of an MPLS network are low-end devices. On a large-scale network with a large number of remote peers, configure the DSLAMs in order to ensure the stable operation of the network and to save system resources. Run the remote-peer auto-dod-request command to configure the automatic triggering of a request to a downstream node for Label Mapping messages associated with all remote LDP peers in DoD mode.\nThere are some precautions as following:\nSet up a remote LDP session before running the remote-peer auto-dod-request command.Run the longest-match command to configure LDP over TE before running the remote-peer auto-dod-request command.Run the mpls ldp advertisement dod command to create an LDP session with a downstream node in DoD mode before running the remote-peer auto-dod-request command."
