    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter MPLS LDP is enabled, a large number of transit LSPs may be automatically established, which consumes resources. To reduce resource consumption, run the propagate mapping command to establish transit LSPs over the routes that match the specified IP prefix list only.\nConfiguration Impact\nLDP will automatically establish LSPs.\nThe propagate mapping command takes effect in either the MPLS-LDP view or MPLS LDP IPv4 view. If the command is configured in both views, only the latter configuration takes effect."
