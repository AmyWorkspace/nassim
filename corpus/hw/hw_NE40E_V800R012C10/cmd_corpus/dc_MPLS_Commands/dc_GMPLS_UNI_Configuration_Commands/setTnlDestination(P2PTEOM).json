    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe destination IP address of a GMPLS UNI tunnel is usually the node ID of an egress EN. An ingress EN initiates the creation of a GMPLS UNI tunnel, and adds the destination IP address of the tunnel to the ERO field in a Path message. Then, the ingress EN sends the Path message to the destination (egress EN) hop by hop along the explicit path from the ingress EN to the egress EN. After the egress EN receives the Path message, it replies to the ingress EN with a Resv message. A GMPLS UNI tunnel is then established.\nWhen configuring a forward GMPLS UNI LSP, you need to run the destination command to specify the destination IP address for this LSP. The destination command only needs to be run on an ingress EN.\nPrerequisites\nThe gmpls-tunnel command has been run to establish a GMPLS UNI tunnel.\nPrecautions\nSetting the value of dest-ip-address to be the node ID of an egress EN is recommended."
