    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn the device, a GMPLS UNI tunnel is bound to a service interface using the bind interface command so that data services can be transmitted along the GMPLS UNI tunnel.\nBoth forward (ingress EN to egress EN) and reverse (egress EN to ingress EN) GMPLS UNI tunnels need to be bound to specific interfaces.\nPrerequisites\nThe gmpls-tunnel command has been run to create a GMPLS UNI tunnel.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the bind interface command is run to bind a GMPLS UNI tunnel to an interface, the protocol status of the interface is the same as the GMPLS UNI tunnel status. The protocol of the interface will go Up only when the GMPLS UNI tunnel goes Up."
