    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo shut down a GMPLS UNI tunnel, run the shutdown command on the ingress EN to release label and bandwidth resources assigned to the tunnel. GMPLS UNI tunnel configurations, however, are kept.\nTo restart this tunnel, run the undo shutdown command on the ingress EN to re-establish the tunnel based on the original configurations. The path of the re-established UNI LSP within a transport network may be different from the original one because the topology or bandwidth within the transport network may change.\nPrerequisites\nThe gmpls-tunnel command has been run to create a GMPLS UNI tunnel.\nPrecautions\nThis command is supported only on the admin VS.\nThe shutdown command can be run on the ingress EN, not the egress EN."
