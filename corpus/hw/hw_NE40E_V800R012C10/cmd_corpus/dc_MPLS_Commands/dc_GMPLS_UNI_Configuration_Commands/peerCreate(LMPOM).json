    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nLMP is used in GMPLS UNI to manage the links of the control channel and data channel. LMP is classified into the following types:\nStatic LMP: LMP neighbors are manually configured and no LMP packet needs to be sent between them.Dynamic LMP: LMP neighbors, the control channel, and the data channel can be automatically discovered.\nAt present, the device supports static LMP only. LMP neighbors need to be manually configured. After LMP is enabled globally, the peer command can be used to create an LMP neighbor and enter the view of the neighbor for later configurations.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe lmp command has been run to create an LMP neighbor.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the lmp static command to configure static LMP.Run the node-id command to configure the address of the LMP neighbor."
