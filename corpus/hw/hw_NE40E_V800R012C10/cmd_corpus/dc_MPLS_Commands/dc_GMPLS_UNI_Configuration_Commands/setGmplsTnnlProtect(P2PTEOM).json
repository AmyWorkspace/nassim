    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAt present, protection switching on a transport network needs to be manually triggered, and protection paths need to be manually configured. These manual operations increase carriers' operation and maintenance expenditure. GMPLS UNI provides flexible link protection and recovery means for transport networks. It enables a transport network to quickly detect faults from end to end and perform protection switching and to dynamically create protection paths. Carriers' operation and maintenance expenditure then can be reduced.\nWhen using the link protection-type command to configure a GMPLS UNI protection mode, take the network bandwidth conditions into consideration.\nPrerequisites\nA GMPLS UNI tunnel has been created using the gmpls-tunnel command.\nPrecautions\nYou only need to run the link protection-type command in the GMPLS UNI tunnel view on the ingress EN."
