    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nGMPLS UNI uses Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to set up a bidirectional GMPLS UNI LSP. Both the forward and reverse UNI LSPs have the same TE requirements. After a forward GMPLS UNI LSP is configured on the ingress EN, a reverse GMPLS UNI LSP must be configured on the egress EN. After the forward and reverse GMPLS UNI LSPs are configured, the system will automatically establish a bidirectional LSP based on configuration data.\nThere are two steps to configure a reverse tunnel:\nRun the passive command to configure a GMPLS UNI tunnel as a reverse tunnel.Run the match-tunnel command to bind the reverse tunnel to a forward tunnel.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe established GMPLS UNI tunnel has been configured as a reverse tunnel using the passive command.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo passive command will delete the match-tunnel command configuration."
