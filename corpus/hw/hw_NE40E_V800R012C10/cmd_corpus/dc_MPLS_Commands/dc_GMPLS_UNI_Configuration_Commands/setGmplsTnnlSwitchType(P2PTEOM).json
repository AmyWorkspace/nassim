    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe data switching type of the data channel of a GMPLS UNI tunnel is the encapsulation type of data packets exchanged between IP and optical layer devices. The device supports the following data switching types:\nDCSC: Ethernet interface switching. A GMPLS UNI tunnel uses an entire physical interface. DCSC can be used when a device provides sufficient interfaces.EVPL: VLAN sub-interface switching. GMPLS UNI tunnels share a physical interface. EVPL can be used when interfaces are insufficient.\n\nPrerequisites\nA GMPLS UNI tunnel has been established using the gmpls-tunnel command.\nPrecautions\nThe switch-type command only needs to be run on the ingress EN."
