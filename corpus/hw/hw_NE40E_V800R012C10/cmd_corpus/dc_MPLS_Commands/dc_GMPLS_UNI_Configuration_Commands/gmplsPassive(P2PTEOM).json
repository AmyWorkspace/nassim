    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nExtended RSVP TE is used in GMPLS UNI to set up two GMPLS UNI tunnels in opposite directions. The two tunnels have the same requirements on traffic engineering. After a forward tunnel is configured on the ingress EN, a reverse tunnel needs to be configured on the egress EN. After the configuration is complete, the system will automatically create two LSPs based on the configuration data.\nThe following steps need to be taken to configure a reverse tunnel:\nRun the passive command to specify a GMPLS UNI tunnel as a reverse tunnel.Run the match-tunnel command to bind the reverse tunnel to the forward tunnel.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe gmpls-tunnel command has been run to create a GMPLS UNI tunnel.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the match-tunnel command to bind the reverse tunnel to the forward tunnel.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo passive command will delete the match-tunnel command configuration."
