    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe LMP used in GMPLS manages links of the control and data channels. Relevant standards describe the major functions of LMP, including:\nControl channel management: Dynamic LMP automatically discovers neighbors and creates, maintains, and manages a control channel.Link attribute association: LMP bundles multiple data links between two connected nodes into a TE link, and synchronizes TE link attributes such as switching types and code types between the two nodes.Link connectivity verification: LMP verifies the connectivity of a data channel or multiple data channels simultaneously.Fault management: LMP rapidly detects data link failures, locates and isolates faults, and triggers the protection and recovery mechanism to work.\nYou need to enable LMP on the ingress EN, ingress CN, egress CN, and egress EN of a GMPLS UNI tunnel.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the lmp command is run, LMP will be enabled globally and the LMP view will be displayed.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the peer command to configure an LMP neighbor.\nRun the lmp static command to enable static LMP."
