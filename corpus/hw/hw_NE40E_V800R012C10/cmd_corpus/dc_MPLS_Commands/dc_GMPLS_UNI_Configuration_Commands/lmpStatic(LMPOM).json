    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nLMP is used in GMPLS to manage the links of the control channel and data channel. LMP is classified into the following types:\nStatic LMP: LMP neighbors, the control channel, and the data channel are all manually configured, and therefore no dynamic LMP negotiation is required.Dynamic LMP: LMP neighbors, the control channel, and the data channel can all be automatically discovered. This minimizes configurations and speeds up network deployment.\nAt present, the device supports static LMP only. The lmp static command can be run only after LMP is enabled globally and an LMP neighbor is specified on the VRP.\n\nPrerequisites\nThe peer (LMP view) command has been run to configure an LMP neighbor."
