    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter a sub-interface for Dot1q VLAN tag termination, sub-interface for QinQ VLAN tag termination, or QinQ stacking sub-interface is configured on a device to transmit L3VPN or IP services, run the display qinq statistics command to check QinQ packet statistics. With this information, you can determine whether the sub-interface is functioning and locate faults.\nPrerequisites\nThe function to collect QinQ packet statistics has been enabled using the statistic enable (VLAN group view) command in the VLAN group view.A sub-interface for Dot1q VLAN tag termination, QinQ VLAN tag termination, or QinQ stacking sub-interface has been bound to a VLAN group using the dot1q termination vid, qinq termination pe-vid ce-vid , or qinq stacking vid command, respectively.\n\nPrecautions\nIf the VLAN group is configured to work in single mode using the group mode command, the system cannot collect QinQ packet statistics based on the inner and outer VLAN tags. Run the group mode command to configure the VLAN group to work in multiple mode. After that, you can run the display qinq statistics command to view the QinQ packet statistics.\nIf many QinQ packet statistics exist, specify interface-type and interface-number in the display qinq statistics command to filter the information."
