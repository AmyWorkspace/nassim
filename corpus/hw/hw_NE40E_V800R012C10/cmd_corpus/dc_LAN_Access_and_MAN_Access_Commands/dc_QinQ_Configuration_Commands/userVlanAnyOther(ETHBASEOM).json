    "ExtraInfo": "When VLAN users access an IP core network through a BRAS, the VLAN tags carried in the user VLAN packets must be deleted as the IP core network cannot identify user VLAN information.\nIf a Layer 2 network connects to an IP core network through a BRAS, it is recommended that you run the user-vlan command on the BRAS's user-side sub-interface to remove the VLAN tags before sending the VLAN packets to the IP core network.\nIf a Layer 3 network connects to an IP core network through a BRAS, it is recommended that run the dot1q termination vid or qinq termination pe-vid ce-vid command on the BRAS's user-side sub-interface to remove the VLAN tags before sending the VLAN packets to the IP core network.\nIf an interface receives a packet but the VLAN Tag carried in the packet is neither a specified tag nor a specified double tag, all packets are forwarded through the User-VLAN sub-interface of the any-other type."
