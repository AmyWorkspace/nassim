    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAll QinQ-enabled devices use 0x8100 as the inner TPID EtherType value. However, different devices may use different outer TPID EtherType values. Upon receiving QinQ packets whose outer TPID EtherType value is not 0x8100 from a non-Huawei device, a Huawei device changes the value to 0x8100 by default. This may result in traffic interruptions. To prevent this issue, run the qinq protocol transport enable command to configure Ethernet interfaces on the Huawei device to retain the outer TPID EtherType value in received QinQ packets.If the outer TPID EtherType value is 88a8 or 9100, running this command does not change the Ethernet encapsulation of the outer VLAN tag, and the EType values of the other TPID are changed to 8100.\nPrecautions\nThe qinq protocol transport enable command takes effect only on double-tagged packets."
