    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interface that has many VLANs configured accesses qualify-mode VPLS services, broadcast, multicast, and unicast traffic with unknown destination MAC addresses will be replicated a lot on this sub-interface, consuming many device bandwidth resources and affecting normal bandwidth. To resolve this problem, run the dot1q termination client-mode single command to enable the sub-interface to deliver only one leaf for replication of one copy of broadcast traffic.\nPrerequisites\nBefore running the dot1q termination client-mode single command:\nA dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interface has been configured.The dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interface has been bound to a qualify-mode VSI (namely, the mac-learn-style qualify command has been run for the VSI).\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter the dot1q termination client-mode single command is run on a dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interface, some HQoS functions will stop taking effect.\nPrecautions\nAfter the dot1q termination client-mode single command is run in the dot1q VLAN tag termination sub-interface view in qualify mode to enable the one leaf mode, the downstream HQoS function of the preposition TM becomes invalid.\nThe single leaf mode can be configured using the dot1q termination client-mode single command on only one dot1q termination sub-interface on an interface or in a VSI."
