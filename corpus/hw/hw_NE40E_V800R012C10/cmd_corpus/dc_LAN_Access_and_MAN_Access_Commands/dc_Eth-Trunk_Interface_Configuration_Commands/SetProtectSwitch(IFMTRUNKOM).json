    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter an Eth-Trunk in manual 1:1 master/backup mode is working properly, you can run the port-master command to specify a new master interface. Specifying a new master interface causes a short data interruption. To prevent the data interruption, you can run the protect-switch command in the view of the Eth-Trunk interface in manual 1:1 master/backup mode to manually switch the active and inactive interfaces. Each time the protect-switch command is run, the active and inactive interfaces are switched once.\nPrerequisites\nAn Eth-Trunk interface in manual 1:1 master/backup mode has been created."
