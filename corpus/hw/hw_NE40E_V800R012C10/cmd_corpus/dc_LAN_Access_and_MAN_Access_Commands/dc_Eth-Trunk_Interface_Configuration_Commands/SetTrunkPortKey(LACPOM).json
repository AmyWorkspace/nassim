    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen devices functioning as PEs are dual-homed to a non-Huawei device and the non-Huawei device does not support E-Trunks, you need to manually configure the same system ID, system priority, and portkey value for the two PEs to ensure that both PE links can be selected.\nPrecautions\nAfter a portkey value is manually configured for an Eth-Trunk in static mode, the bandwidth change does not cause the portkey to change, and the portkey configuration causes LACP renegotiation."
