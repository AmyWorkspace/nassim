    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe master and backup devices in an E-Trunk exchange Hello packets periodically. If the backup device in the E-Trunk does not receive a Hello packet from the peer device before the timeout period expires, the device enters the master state. The timeout period is carried in the Hello packet sent by the peer device.\nIf the Hello packet sent by the peer device does not carry a timeout period, the timeout period configured on the local device takes effect.\nPrecautions\nThe formula for calculating a timeout period is as follows: Timeout period = Interval at which Hello packets are sent x Time multiplier for detecting Hello packets. To configure the time multiplier for detecting Hello packets, run the timer hold-on-failure multiplier command. The timeout period should be over 5 minutes."
