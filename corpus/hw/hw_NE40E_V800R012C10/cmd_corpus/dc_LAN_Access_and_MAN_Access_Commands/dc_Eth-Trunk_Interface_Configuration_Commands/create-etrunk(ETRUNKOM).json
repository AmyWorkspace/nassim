    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn Eth-Trunk implements board-level reliability, whereas an E-Trunk implements device-level reliability.\nAn E-Trunk must be created in the system view using the e-trunk command before you configure its attributes. The attributes include E-Trunk parameters (E-Trunk priority, E-Trunk authentication and encryption mode, password, interval at which Hello packets are sent, time multiplier for detecting Hello packets, and E-Trunk description), and association between the E-Trunk and BFD.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the e-trunk command in the Eth-Trunk interface view to add an Eth-Trunk interface to the E-Trunk so that the E-Trunk takes effect."
