    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) algorithm uses the hash algorithm and outputs a message digest after a key and message are input.\nBy default, the E-Trunk authentication and encryption mode is HMAC-SHA1. run the authentication-mode command to set the E-Trunk authentication and encryption mode to HMAC-SHA2-256 or ENHANCED-HMAC-SHA256.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the security-key command to configure a password for encrypting E-Trunk packets.\nPrecautions\nTwo devices in an E-Trunk must have the same E-Trunk authentication and encryption mode.Run the undo authentication-mode command to restore the default configuration, the E-Trunk authentication and encryption mode HMAC-SHA1 have a low security, which may bring security risks. To improve system security, run the authentication-mode command to set the E-Trunk authentication and encryption mode to HMAC-SHA2-256 or ENHANCED-HMAC-SHA256"
