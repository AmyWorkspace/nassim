    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn dual-homing networking, E-Trunk is used to implement link-level and device-level reliability. If a device that is dual-homed to two devices working in master/backup mode sends traffic to the backup device, you need to run the port unselected discard input-packet command to enable the Eth-Trunk interface on the backup device to discard packets when the interface works in the backup state in an E-Trunk, thereby blocking traffic and preventing loops.\nPrerequisites\nThe Eth-Trunk interface has been associated with an E-Trunk.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter this command is run, the backup Eth-Trunk interface will discard packets.\nPrecautions\nThis command cannot be run on an Eth-Trunk interface that is not associated with an E-Trunk."
