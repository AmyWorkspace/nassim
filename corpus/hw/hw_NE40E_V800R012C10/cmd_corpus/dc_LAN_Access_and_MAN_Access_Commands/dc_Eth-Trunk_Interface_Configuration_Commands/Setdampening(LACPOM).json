    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf the state of an Eth-Trunk interface frequently flaps, the LACP protocol status of the Eth-Trunk interface also flaps, affecting the Eth-Trunk interface operations. To resolve this problem, run the lacp dampening state-flapping command on the Eth-Trunk interface in LACP mode to enable the state flapping suppression function. When the first flapping occurs, the state machine changes after 1s. When the second flapping occurs, the state machine changes after 3s. From the third flapping, the state machine changes after 5s.\nPrerequisites\nAn Eth-Trunk interface has been configured to work in LACP mode using the mode lacp-static command."
