    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nLACP system priorities are set to prioritize the device at either end of an Eth-Trunk link. The device with a higher system priority is selected as the Actor, and then active member interfaces are selected according to the configuration of the Eth-Trunk interface on the Actor.\nIf neither of the device at either end of an Eth-Trunk link is configured with a system priority, the devices use the default value 32768. In this case, the Actor is selected based on the system ID. That is, the device with the smaller system ID becomes the Actor.\nYou can run the lacp priority command in the system view to change the Actor of an Eth-Trunk link.\nPrerequisites\nThe LACP system priority configuration mode has been set to system-priority using the lacp priority-command-mode system-priority command in the system view."
