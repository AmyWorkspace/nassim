    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA non-Huawei CE is dual-homed to a network over Eth-Trunks in static LACP mode. To ensure reliable service transmission, an E-Trunk is configured on Huawei PE1 and PE2. If PE1 and PE2 have different system software versions, the CollectorMaxDelay field in LACPDUs that PE1 and PE2 send may have different default values. As a result, the member interfaces of the non-Huawei CE will receive LACPDUs with different CollectorMaxDelay values, burdening the CE's CPU and affecting CE performance.\nTo address this problem, run the lacp collector delay command on a PE to configure the value of the CollectorMaxDelay field, so that the CollectorMaxDelay field has the same value in LACPDUs sent by PE1 and PE2.\nPrerequisites\nThe mode lacp-static command has been run in the Eth-Trunk interface view to configure the Eth-Trunk interface to work in static LACP mode."
