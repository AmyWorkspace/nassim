    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTwo devices in an E-Trunk exchange E-Trunk packets to negotiate their master/slave status. During the negotiation, the devices determine their master/slave status based on their E-Trunk priorities and system IDs. Specifically, the device with the higher priority is the master device. Run the priority command to configure an E-Trunk priority for the device.\nPrecautions\nIf the devices have the same E-Trunk priority, the device with the smaller system ID is the master device.If the devices in an E-Trunk have the same E-Trunk priority and system ID, both devices are considered as master devices. It is recommended that you configure different E-Trunk priorities for the devices."
