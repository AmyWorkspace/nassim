    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn E-Trunk is Huawei-specific. The default UDP port number 1025 used to send and receive E-Trunk packets may conflict with the UDP port number used by another protocol. To ensure the forwarding of E-Trunk packets, run the e-trunk port command to change the UDP port number used to send and receive E-Trunk packets.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf you change the UDP port number when E-Trunk is running, the two devices in the E-Trunk may not be able to communicate. If E-Trunk negotiation times out, both devices in the E-Trunk may become master devices.\nPrecautions\nThe two devices in an E-Trunk must have the same UDP port number. If you change the UDP port number when E-Trunk is running, complete the change before E-Trunk negotiation times out. After the e-trunk port command is run, the interface number of the E-Trunk is changed, causing E-Trunk re-negotiation."
