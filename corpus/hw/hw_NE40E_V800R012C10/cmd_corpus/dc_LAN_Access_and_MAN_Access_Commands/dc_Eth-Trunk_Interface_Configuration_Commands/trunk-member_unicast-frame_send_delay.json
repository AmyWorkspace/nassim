    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen the link of an Eth-Trunk interface that has IP services or Layer 2 known unicast services configured recovers from faults and traffic needs to switch back to the recovered link, an interface has to wait for 1.5s before being added to the Eth-Trunk interface by default. This duration may fail to guarantee that the service forwarding entries are ready. To resolve this issue, run the unicast trunk-member delay command to configure a delay longer than 1.5s, so that the service forwarding entries have sufficient time to become ready before the interface is added."
