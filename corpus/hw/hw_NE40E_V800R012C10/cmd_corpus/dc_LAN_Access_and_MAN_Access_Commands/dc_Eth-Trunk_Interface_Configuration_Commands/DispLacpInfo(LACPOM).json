    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nLACP system priorities or IDs determine which Eth-Trunk interface in static LACP mode at either end of an Eth-Trunk link can function as the Actor.\nThe two Eth-Trunk interfaces first compare their LACP system priorities. The one with a smaller LACP system priority is selected as the Actor.\nThe default LACP system priority is 32768. It can be changed using the lacp priority command.\nIf the two Eth-Trunk interfaces have the same LACP system priority, they compare their system IDs. The one with a smaller system ID is selected as the Actor.\nThe default LACP system ID is the MAC address of an main control board's Ethernet interface.\nThe display eth-trunk command can be used to check the LACP system priority and system ID only after an Eth-Trunk interface working in static LACP mode is configured, causing inconvenience in network planning. To facilitate network planning, you can run the display lacp brief command to check the LACP system priority and system ID when no Eth-Trunk interface working in static LACP mode is configured."
