    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\n\nIP-Trunk member interfaces balance traffic based on their weights.\nA higher weight indicates a heavier load. To increase the load on a member interface, you can run the distribute-weight command to set a higher weight for the member interface.\nTo restore the default weight of a member interface, you can run the undo distribute-weight command.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAn IP-Trunk interface has been correctly configured, and interfaces have been added to the IP-Trunk interface.\n\nConfiguration Impact\n\nThe higher the weight of a member interface, the heavier the load over the member link.\n\nPrecautions\n\nIf the distribute-weight command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
