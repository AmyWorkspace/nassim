    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf not all interfaces to be added to an Eth-Trunk interface in static LACP mode reside on the same traffic manager (TM) but you want those on the same TM to negotiate first, run the lacp backup-mode enable command to enable the Eth-Trunk interface to work in static LACP master/backup negotiation mode and then run the lacp port-role master command to set the master role for each interface on the same TM. These interfaces then negotiate first.\nPrerequisites\nAn Eth-Trunk interface has been configured to work in static LACP mode using the mode lacp-static command in the Eth-Trunk interface view.The Eth-Trunk interface does not contain any member interface."
