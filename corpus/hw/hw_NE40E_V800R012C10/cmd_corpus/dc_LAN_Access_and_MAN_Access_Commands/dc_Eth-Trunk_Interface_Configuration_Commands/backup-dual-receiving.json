    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen a Huawei device connects to a non-Huawei device through an Eth-Trunk interface in manual 1:1 master/backup mode, the non-Huawei device can send traffic through both the master and backup interfaces, but the Huawei device can receive traffic only through the master interface by default. As a result, the Huawei device cannot properly communicate with the non-Huawei device. To resolve this problem, run the backup-dual-receiving enable command on the Huawei device to enable the dual receiving function on the Eth-Trunk interface, so that both the Eth-Trunk interface's master and backup interfaces can receive traffic.\nPrerequisites\nAn Eth-Trunk interface has been configured to work in manual 1:1 master/backup mode using the mode manual backup command.\nPrecautions\nBefore running the mode or undo mode command, run the undo backup-dual-receiving enable command to disable the dual-receiving function on the Eth-Trunk interface in manual 1:1 master/backup mode."
