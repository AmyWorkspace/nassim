    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an E-Trunk consists of Eth-Trunk interfaces working in static LACP mode, each member Eth-Trunk interface and the connected peer Eth-Trunk interface use LACP E-Trunk system priorities to determine the priority of the device at either end of the Eth-Trunk link. The device with the higher priority functions as the LACP Actor and determines which member interfaces in its Eth-Trunk interface are active based on the interface priorities. The other device selects the member interfaces connected to the active member interfaces on the Actor as active member interfaces.\nIf a member Eth-Trunk interface in an E-Trunk has the same LACP system priority as its connected Eth-Trunk interface, run the lacp e-trunk system-id command to configure an LACP E-Trunk system ID. In this situation, LACP system IDs are used to determine the priority of the device at either end of the Eth-Trunk link. The device with the higher priority then selects active member interfaces in its Eth-Trunk interface, and the other device selects the interconnected member interfaces to be active member interfaces.\nPrecautions\nThe LACP E-Trunk system ID configured in the system view takes effect on all Eth-Trunk interfaces that are added to the E-Trunk. The LACP E-Trunk system ID configured in an Eth-Trunk interface view takes effect only on the Eth-Trunk interface. If the lacp e-trunk system-id command is run in the system view and the lacp system-id command is in run in an Eth-Trunk interface view, the LACP system ID configured in the Eth-Trunk interface view takes precedence."
