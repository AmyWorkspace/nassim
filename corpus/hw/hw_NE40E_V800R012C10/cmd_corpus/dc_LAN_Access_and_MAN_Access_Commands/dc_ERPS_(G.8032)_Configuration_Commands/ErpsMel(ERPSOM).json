    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a Layer 2 network where ERPS is running, if the connectivity fault management (CFM) protocol is enabled, the MEL field in R-APS PDUs determines whether these ERPS protocols have a higher priority and can be forwarded. If the MEL value of the ERPS ring is smaller than the MEL value of the CFM protocol, the packets have a lower priority and are discarded. You can run the raps-mel command to set the value of the MEL field in R-APS PDUs.\nIn addition to determining whether packets can be forwarded, the MEL value can also be used to facilitate the communications with other vendors' devices in the ERPS ring. The same MEL value ensures smooth communications between devices."
