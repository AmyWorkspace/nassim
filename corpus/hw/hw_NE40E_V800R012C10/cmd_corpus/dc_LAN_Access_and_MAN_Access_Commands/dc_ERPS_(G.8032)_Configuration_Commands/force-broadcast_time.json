    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a fast traffic switchover occurs on an ERPS ring, traffic is forcibly broadcast. In this way, the traffic can be quickly switched to the desired link, meeting the performance requirements of fast switching. However, broadcast storms may occur. In this case, run the force-broadcast time command to configure a forcible broadcast period as needed to prevent broadcast storms occuring."
