ERPSv2, fully compatible with ERPSv1, provides the following enhanced functions:\nSupports multi-ring topologies, such as intersecting rings.Supports ring auto protection switching protocol data unit (R-APS PDU) transmission modes on sub-rings.Supports two manual port blocking modes: forced switch (FS) and manual switch (MS).Supports both revertive and non-revertive switching.\nTo configure an ERPS version, run the version command.\n\nPrecautions\nBefore specifying ERPSv1 for an ERPSv2-running device, delete all ERPS configurations that ERPSv1 does not support. Otherwise, the version cannot be changed."
