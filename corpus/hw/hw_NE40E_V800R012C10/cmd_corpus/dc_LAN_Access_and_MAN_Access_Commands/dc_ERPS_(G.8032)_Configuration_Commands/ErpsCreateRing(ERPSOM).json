    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nEthernet Ring Protection Switching (ERPS) is a standard protocol issued by the ITU-T to prevent loops on ring networks. ERPS provides carrier-class reliability with a fast convergence speed. ERPS takes effect on a ring network if all devices on a ring network support it.\nIf ERPS needs to be enabled on a device, run the erps ring command to create an ERPS ring and enter the ERPS ring view.After entering the ERPS ring view, you can configure parameters such as a control VLAN and an ERP instance for the ERPS ring.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the control-vlan (ERPS ring view) command to configure a control VLAN for the ERPS ring, and run the protected-instance (ERP ring view) command to configure an ERP instance for the ERPS ring.\nPrecautions\nIf an ERPS ring needs to be deleted, ensure that no interfaces are added to the ERPS ring. If any interface is added to the ERPS ring, a message is displayed when the ERPS ring is being deleted. In this case, run the undo erps ring command in the interface view or the undo port command in the ERPS ring view to remove the interface. and run the undo erps ring command to delete the ERPS ring."
