    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a Layer 2 network running ERPS, if the RPL owner port is unblocked owning to a link or node failure, the involved port may not go Up immediately after the link or node recovers. Run the wtr-timer command can prevent the RPL owner port alternates between the Up and Down states. The node where the RPL owner port resides starts a WTR timer after receiving a ring auto protection switching (R-APS) PDU indicating the link or node recovery. If the node receives an R-APS PDU indicating that another port fails before the timer expires, it terminates the WTR timer. If the node does not receive any R-APS PDU indicating that another port fails before the timer expires, it unblocks the RPL owner port when the timer expires and sends an R-APS PDU indicating that the RPL owner port is blocked. After receiving this R-APS PDU, the other nodes set their ports on the ring to the Forwarding state."
