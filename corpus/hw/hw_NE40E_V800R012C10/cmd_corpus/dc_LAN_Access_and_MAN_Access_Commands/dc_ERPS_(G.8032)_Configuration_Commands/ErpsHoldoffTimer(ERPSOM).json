    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn different Layer 2 networks running EPRS, there may be different requirements on protective switchovers. For example, if multi-layer services are provided, users hope that a protective switchover is not performed immediately after a server fails, ensuring that clients do not sense the failure.\nIn this case, you can set run the holdoff-timer command to set a Holdoff timer. If the fault occurs, the fault is not immediately sent to ERPS until the Holdoff timer times out."
