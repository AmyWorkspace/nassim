To check the statistics, run the display garp statistics command. The statistics help determine whether GARP is functioning properly.\nIf the parameter interface is not specified in the command, GARP statistics on all interfaces are displayed.If the parameter interface is specified in the command, GARP statistics on a specific interface are displayed."
