    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) divides a switching network into multiple regions, each of which has multiple spanning trees that are independent of each other. Each region is called an MST region, and each spanning tree is called a Multiple Spanning Tree Instance (MSTI).\nTwo devices belong to the same MST region only when their following configurations are the same:\nMST region nameMST region revision levelMappings between MSTIs and VLANs\nTo ensure that MST region configuration on each device is correct, run the check region-configuration command to check the MST region configuration. If the MST region configuration is correct, commit the configuration.\n\nPrecautions\nBy default, the VLANs that are not mapped to non-zero instances using the instance command are mapped to instance 0."
