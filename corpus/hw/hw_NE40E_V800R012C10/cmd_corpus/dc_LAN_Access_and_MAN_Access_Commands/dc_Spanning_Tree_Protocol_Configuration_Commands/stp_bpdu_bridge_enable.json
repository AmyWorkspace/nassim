    "FuncDef": "The stp bpdu bridge enable command enables transparent transmission of STP packets with destination MAC addresses being 01-80-c2-00-00-00 (C-STP packets) and 01-80-c2-00-00-08 (S-STP packets).\nThe undo stp bpdu bridge enable command restores the default processing of the C-STP and S-STP packets.\n\nBy default, the S-STP packets which destination MAC addresses being 01-80-c2-00-00-08 are discarded. The C-STP packets with the destination MAC addresses being 01-80-c2-00-00-00 are processed as follows:\n\n\nLayer 2 main interfaces: discard\n\n\nMain interfaces access VPLS/VLL: transmit\n\n\nMain interfaces access VPLS/VLL: discard\n\n\nSub-interfaces access VPLS/VLL: discard\n\n\nEVC sub-interfaces access VLL/BD: discard\n\n\nMain interfaces access EVPN: transmit\n\n\nSub-interfaces access EVPN: discard\n\n\nMain interfaces access EVPL: transmit\n\n\nSub-interfaces access EVPL: discard",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, when STP is disabled on Layer 2 main interfaces, STP packets with the destination MAC addresses being 01-80-c2-00-00-00 and 01-80-c2-00-00-08 are discarded. Run the stp bpdu bridge enable command to enable transparent transmission of these STP packets. When the stp bpdu bridge enable command is run in the system view, STP packets with the destination MAC addresses being 01-80-c2-00-00-00 and 01-80-c2-00-00-08 are transparently transmitted on all Layer 2 main interfaces."
