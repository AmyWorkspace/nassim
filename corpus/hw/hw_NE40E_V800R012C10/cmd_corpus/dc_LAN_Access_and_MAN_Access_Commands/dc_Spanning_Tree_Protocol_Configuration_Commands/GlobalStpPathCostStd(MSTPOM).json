    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPath costs are used as a reference for a spanning tree protocol to select stable links, block redundant paths, and trim a network into a loop-free network. Path costs vary with path cost calculation standards. To set a standard for calculating the path cost, run the stp pathcost-standard command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the path cost calculation standard is changed on a port, the path cost of the port is restored to the default value. To set a path cost for a port, run the stp cost command.\nPrecautions\nGenerally, all devices on the same network should use the same path cost calculation standard.After STP is enabled on a PW interface, the cost of the PW interface is fixed: dot1d-1998=3, dot1t=4657, and legacy=13."
