    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter an MSTP device properly starts, each port of this device belongs to MSTP process 0 by default. The link connecting an MSTP device to an access ring is an access link. To isolate services on access rings using an MSTP process, run the stp binding process command to add an interface on an access link to a specified MSTP process.\nPrerequisites\nAn MSTP process has been configured using the stp process command.\nPrecautions\nAn interface on an access link can be added to only one MSTP process. If the stp binding process command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
