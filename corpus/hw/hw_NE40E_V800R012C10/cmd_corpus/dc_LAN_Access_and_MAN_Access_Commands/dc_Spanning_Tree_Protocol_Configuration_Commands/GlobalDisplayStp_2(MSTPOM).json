    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a Layer 2 network running MSTP, a device clears ARP entries and MAC entries after receiving TC BPDUs. If a device receives too many TC BPDUs, the device will frequently clear ARP entries and MAC entries, causing high CPU usage. As a result, network traffic is unstable.\nYou can run the display stp topology-change command to display statistics about MSTP topology changes. If the statistics increase, network flapping occurs.\nPrecautions\nIf you run this command in the MSTP process view without specifying an MSTP process, information about the MSTP process in this view is displayed by default. If you run this command in the other view without specifying an MSTP process, information about MSTP process 0 is displayed by default."
