    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a public link becomes faulty on a dual-homing networking, rings that the public link accesses may unblock their blocked ports, causing a permanent network loop.\nTo resolve this problem, run the stp link-share-protection command to enable shared-link protection. When a public link becomes faulty, the working mode of each device on the public link will be forcibly switched to RSTP. After shared-link protection and root protection are deployed, a port will remain in the blocked state after receiving packets of a higher priority from a downstream device. This prevents network loops.\nPrecautions\nShared-link protection is valid only in processes. Before running the stp link-share-protection command, ports have been correctly bound to the corresponding process using the stp binding process command."
