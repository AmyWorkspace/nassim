    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a Layer 2 network running STP, if a port of a device is connected to a non-P2P link, the port cannot perform fast status transition.\nIf a port works in full-duplex mode, the port is connected to a P2P link, and force-true can be set in the stp point-to-point command.\nIf a port works in half-duplex mode, run the stp point-to-point force-true command to forcibly set the type of the link to which the port is connected to P2P, implementing rapid network convergence.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe stp point-to-point command configuration on a port takes effect in all spanning tree instances where the port resides."
