    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMSTP divides a switching network into multiple regions. Each region is a Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) region and has independent Multiple Spanning Trees. Each spanning tree is called a Multiple Spanning Tree instance (MSTI).\nTwo devices belong to the same MST region if their following configurations are the same:\nMST region nameMappings between VLANs and MSTIsRevision level of the MST region\nBefore setting the preceding parameters on a device or process, run the stp region-configuration command to enter the MST region view.\n\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the region-name command to set the MST region name.Run the instance command to set mappings between VLANs and MSTIs.Run the revision-level name command to set a revision level for the MST region."
