    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe devices on a Layer 2 network running Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) communicate with each other by exchanging Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). An MST BPDU has a field that indicates the number of remaining hops.\nThe number of remaining hops in a BPDU sent by the root device is the maximum number of hops.The number of remaining hops in a BPDU sent by a non-root device equals the maximum number of hops minus the number of hops from the non-root device to the root device.If a device receives a BPDU in which the number of remaining hops is 0, the device discards the BPDU.\nThe maximum number of hops of a spanning tree in an MST region determines the network scale. To set the maximum number of hops in an MST domain, run the stp max-hops command to control the network scale of a spanning tree.\n\nPrecautions\nIn an MST region, the maximum number of hops set on the root device in a Common and Internal Spanning Tree (CIST) or an MSTI is the maximum number of hops in the CIST or Multiple Spanning Tree instance (MSTI)."
