    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMST BPDUs have two formats: dot1s (IEEE 802.1s standard) and legacy (proprietary). To facilitate device communication, run the stp compliance command to set an MST BPDU format for a local device based on the format of MST BPDUs from the remote device.\nTo allow a port to automatically accommodate to the format of MST BPDUs sent by a remote device, configure the auto format.\nPrecautions\nIf you configure different MST BPDU formats on the same interface in the interface view, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
