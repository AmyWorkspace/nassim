    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter you configure mappings between MSTIs and VLANs, run the display vlan instance mapping command to view the mappings between MSTIs and VLANs.\nPrerequisites\nThe mappings between MSTIs and VLANs have been configured using either of the following methods:\nConfigure mappings between MSTIs and VLANs in the MST region view.\n Run the system-view command to enter the system view. Run the stp region-configuration command to enter the MST region view. Run the instance instance-id vlan { vlan-id [ to vlan-id ] }&<1-10> command to map VLANs to an MSTI. By default, all VLANs in an MST region are mapped to MSTI 0. A VLAN cannot be mapped to multiple MSTIs. If you map a VLAN that is already mapped to an MSTI to another MSTI, the original mapping is deleted.\nConfigure mappings between MSTIs and VLANs in the VLAN instance view.\n Run the system-view command to enter the system view. Run the vlan instance command to enter the VLAN instance view. Run the instance instance-id vlan { vlan-id [ to vlan-id ] }&<1-10> command to map VLANs to an MSTI."
