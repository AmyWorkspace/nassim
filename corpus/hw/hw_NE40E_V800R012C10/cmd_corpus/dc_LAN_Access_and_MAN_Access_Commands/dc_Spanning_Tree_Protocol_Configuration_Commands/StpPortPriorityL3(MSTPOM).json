    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen ports participate in spanning tree calculation, the port IDs (PIDs) of these ports on devices may affect the designated port election result. During spanning tree calculation, the port with the smallest PID is elected as the designated port.\nA PID is the ID of a port and consists of a 4-bit priority and a 12-bit port number.\nTo change the priority of a port, run the stp port priority command. This affects the PID of the port and determines whether the port can be elected as the designated port.\nConfiguration Impact\nWhen the priority of a port changes, a spanning tree protocol recalculates the role of the port and causes the port status change.\nPrecautions\nThe port priority determines a port role in a specified spanning tree instance and process. You can set different priorities for a port in different spanning tree instances or processes so that user traffic can be forwarded along different links and traffic load balancing can be implemented."
