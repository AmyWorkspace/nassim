    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network running STP, a device sends BPDUs to other devices on the same spanning tree at an interval of the Hello time. BPDUs are transmitted to help maintain network stability. If the device sends too many BPDUs within the Hello time, the transmission occupies excessive system and bandwidth resources.\nTo avoid this problem, run the stp transmit-limit command in the interface view to configure the maximum number of BPDUs that an interface sends every second. This configuration limits the rate at which an interface sends BPDUs and prevents the spanning tree protocol from occupying excessive system and bandwidth resources.\nThe Hello time is the value of the Hello timer and specifies the interval at which the device sends BPDUs. You can configure the Hello time using the stp timer hello command.\nPrecautions\nIf the same maximum number of BPDUs need to be sent by each interface on a device, run the stp transmit-limit (system view) command. The stp transmit-limit (interface view) command takes precedence over the stp transmit-limit (system view) command. If the stp transmit-limit (interface view) command is run on an interface, the stp transmit-limit (system view) command does not take effect on the interface.\nThe stp transmit-limit command sets the maximum number of BPDUs that an interface sends every second in each process. If an interface is added to multiple processes, the maximum number of BPDUs multiplies. For example, If you run the stp transmit-limit command to configure an interface to send a maximum number of five BPDUs every second and the interface joins 3 processes, the interface can send a maximum of 15 (5 x 3) BPDUs every second."
