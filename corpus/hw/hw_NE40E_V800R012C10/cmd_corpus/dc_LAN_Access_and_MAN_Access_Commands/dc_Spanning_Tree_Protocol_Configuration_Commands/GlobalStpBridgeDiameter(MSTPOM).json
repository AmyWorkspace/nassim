    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn a network running STP, the network diameter is the maximum number of devices between two devices. An improper network diameter may slow down network convergence and affect user communication.You can run the stp bridge-diameter command to set a proper network diameter based on the network scale. This helps accelerate network convergence.The following time parameters are related to the network scale:Hello TimeForward DelayMax Age\n\n\nConfiguration Impact\nThe device will automatically set proper values for Hello Time, Forward Delay, and Max Age based on the configured network diameter.\nPrecautions\nAfter a network diameter is configured, ForwardDelay and Max Age values are recorded in the configuration file, but the bridge-diameter value is not recorded in the configuration file. For an MSTP network, the network diameter configured using the stp bridge-diameter command takes effect only for the CIST."
