    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMultiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) divides a switching network into multiple regions, each of which has independent Multiple Spanning Trees. Each spanning tree is called a Multiple Spanning Tree instance (MSTI), and each region is called a Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) region.\nTwo devices belong to the same MST region only when their following configurations are the same:\nMST region nameMappings between MSTIs and VLANsMST region revision level\nTo configure VLAN-to-instance mapping based on a default algorithm, run the vlan-mapping modulo command.\n\nPrecautions\nThe instance command is recommended because VLAN-to-instance mapping based on the algorithm cannot meet actual mapping requirements.\nIn the vlan-mapping modulo command, a VLAN is mapped to an instance based on this formula: Instance ID = MOD (VLAN ID-1)/Modulo value + 1. In the formula, MOD (VLAN ID-1)/Modulo value means the remainder of (VLAN ID-1) divided by the modulo value. For example, if the modulo is 16, VLAN 1 is mapped to MSTI 1, VLAN 2 to MSTI 2, VLAN 16 to MSTI 16, and VLAN 17 to MSTI 1."
