    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nPriorities of devices are an important factor to calculate a spanning tree and determine root bridge selection.On a network running STP/RSTP/MSTP, each spanning tree has only one root bridge responsible for sending Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). Because the root bridge is of great importance, it is hoped that a device with high performance and network hierarchy can be chosen as the root bridge. However, this cannot be achieved if the device has a low priority. To set a priority for the device, run the stp priority command.You can also run the stp priority command to set a low priority for devices with low performance and network hierarchy so that these devices are not selected as the root bridge.On an MSTP network, each device can be set with a unique priority in each spanning tree instance.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nA smaller priority value indicates a higher possibility to be selected as the root bridge.\nPrecautions\nIf a device has been configured as the primary or secondary root bridge, before changing the priority of the device, run the undo stp  root command to disable the root bridge function.After the stp root primary command is run to configure a device as the primary root bridge, the priority value of the device is 0.After the stp root secondary command is run to configure a device as the secondary root bridge, the priority value of the device is 4096."
