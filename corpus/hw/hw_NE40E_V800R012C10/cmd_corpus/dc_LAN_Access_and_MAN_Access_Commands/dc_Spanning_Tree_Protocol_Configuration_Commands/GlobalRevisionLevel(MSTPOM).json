Each region is called an MST region, and each spanning tree is called a MSTI.\nTwo devices belong to the same MST region only when their following configurations are the same:\nMST region nameMappings between MSTIs and VLANsMST region revision level\nIf two devices have the same region name and VLAN mapping table, run the revision-level command twice to configure different revision levels for the two devices. After this configuration, the devices belong to different MST regions."
