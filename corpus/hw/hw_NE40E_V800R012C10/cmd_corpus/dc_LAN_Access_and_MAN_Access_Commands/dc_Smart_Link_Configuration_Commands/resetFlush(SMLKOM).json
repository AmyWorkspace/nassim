    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo collect Flush packet statistics within a specified period of time, run the reset smart-link flush command to clear existing Flush packet statistics. For example, a large number of Flush packets are sent after a link switchover is performed in a Smart Link group. If a device is faulty, you can check information about received Flush packets to help locate the fault. If existing Flush packet statistics are of no use, run the reset smart-link flush command to clear the statistics to avoid the impact of excessive Flush packet statistics on the next fault locating.\nPrecautions\nFlush packet statistics cannot be restored after being cleared, therefore, exercise caution when running the reset smart-link flush command, run the display smart-link flush command."
