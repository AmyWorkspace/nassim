    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an RRPP ring accesses a virtual private LAN service (VPLS) network in which devices are connected using PWs, devices cannot respond to RRPP packets directly. Therefore, the VPLS network cannot sense the status change of the RRPP ring. When the RRPP ring topology changes, each node on the VPLS network still forwards downstream data according to the entries generated before the RRPP ring topology changes. As a result, the downstream traffic cannot be forwarded. After RRPP snooping is configured on a sub-interface or VLANIF interface of a device on a VPLS network, the VPLS network can transparently transmit RRPP packets, detect the changes on the RRPP ring, and update the forwarding entries to ensure that traffic is immediately switched to a congestion-free path.\nTo display packet statistics on an interface where RRPP snooping is enabled, run this command."
