After this command is run, a BD Down event is reported to the BDIF interface immediately after the BD is Down.\nBy default, the BD damping function is disabled. The default delay is 0 seconds, indicating that the BDIF interface goes Down immediately after the BD is Down.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf all the interfaces added to a BD go Down, the BD will report a BD Down event to the corresponding BDIF interface, causing the BDIF interface status to change. The master/slave switchover will cause the BDIF interface to alternate frequently between Up and Down. As a result, network flapping occurs. To avoid this situation, run the damping time delay-time command on the BDIF interface to enable the BD damping function. If the last Up interface in the BD becomes Down, the device enabled with the BD damping function will report the BD status to the BDIF interface after the set delay expires. If an interface in the BD becomes Up before the set delay expires, the BDIF interface status remains Up."
