    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a BD is faulty and needs to be filtered out, run the shutdown command to change the BD to the Down state.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe BD in the Down state does not forward packets. As a result, users within the BD cannot communicate with each other.\nPrecautions\nTraffic on a VBDIF interface includes Layer 2 traffic and Layer 3 traffic. Running the shutdown command in the BD view forbids all traffic on the VBDIF interface, whereas running the shutdown command in the VBDIF view only forbids Layer 3 traffic."
