    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA bridge domain is a broadcast domain, in which bridge domain members broadcast received packets within the domain. To reduce the broadcast volume, member interfaces that do not need to communicate can be isolated. To meet this requirement, run the split-horizon enable command to enable split horizon. Unknown Unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic between AC interfaces in the BD is then isolated.\nPrerequisites\nA bridge domain has been created using the bridge-domain command.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe split-horizon enable command run in the BD view takes effect on all bridge domain member interfaces. If bridge domain member interfaces need to communicate, run the split-horizon command in a specific EVC Layer 2 sub-interface view."
