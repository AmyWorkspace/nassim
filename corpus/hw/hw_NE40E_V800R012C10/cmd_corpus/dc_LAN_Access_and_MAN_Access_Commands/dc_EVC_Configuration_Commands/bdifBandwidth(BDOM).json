    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nThe bandwidth command mainly ensures that the network management station (NMS) can acquire the bandwidth of the VBDIF interface. The NMS can check the interface bandwidth through the two objects ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed in IF-MIB.\nIf the configured bandwidth is smaller than 4000 Mbit/s, ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed are respectively displayed as x 1000 x 1000 and bandwidth.If the configured bandwidth is equal to or larger than 4000 Mbit/s, ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed are respectively displayed as 4294967295 (0XFFFFFFFF) and bandwidth."
