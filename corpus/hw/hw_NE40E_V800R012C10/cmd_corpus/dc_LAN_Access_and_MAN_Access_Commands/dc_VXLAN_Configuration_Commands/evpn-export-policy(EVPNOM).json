    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, an EVPN instance adds all VPN targets in the export VPN target list to EVPN routes to be advertised to its peers. To control route export more precisely, run the export route-policy command to associate the EVPN instance with an export routing policy and set attributes for eligible routes.\nPrerequisites\nAn RD has been configured for the EVPN instance using the route-distinguisher command.\nIf the export route-policy to be associated with a VPN instance IPv4 address family does not exist, configure the export route-policy first.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one."
