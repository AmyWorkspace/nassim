    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn the DCI-PE all-active scenario, the PEs in the active state use the same address as the source NVE address (namely, the default source VTEP address). Therefore, the PEs in the active state cannot use this address to establish a VXLAN tunnel. To improve the DCI-PE all-active solution, you can run the bypass source command to specify an independent source VTEP address for each PE in the active state so that the PEs can establish a bypass VXLAN tunnel with each other. The PEs establish a BGP EVPN peer relationship. BGP EVPN advertises the source VTEP address of the local PE on the bypass VXLAN tunnel to the peer PE. The peer PE establishes a bypass VXLAN tunnel based on its source VTEP address and the received source VTEP address from the local PE."
