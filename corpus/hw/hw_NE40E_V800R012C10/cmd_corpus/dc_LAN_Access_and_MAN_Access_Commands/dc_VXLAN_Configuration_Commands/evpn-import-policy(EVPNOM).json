    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, an EVPN instance matches the export VPN targets of received routes against its import VPN targets to determine whether to import these routes. To control route import more precisely, run the import route-policy command to associate the EVPN instance with an import routing policy and set attributes for eligible routes.\nPrerequisites\nAn RD has been configured for the EVPN instance using the route-distinguisher command.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf the command is run more than once, the latest configuration overrides the previous one.\nPrecautions\nIf the specified routing policy does not exist, run the route-policy command to create the routing policy."
