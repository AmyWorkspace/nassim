    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo bind a P2P VXLAN tunnel to an EVPL instance, run the local-vni command to bind the EVPL instance in VXLAN mode to the VNI of the P2P VXLAN tunnel.\nPrecautions\nAn EVPL instance can be bound to one VNI. Likewise, a VNI can be bound to one EVPL instance.The binding relationship between an EVPL instance and a VNI cannot be modified. However, you can run the undo local-vni command to delete the binding relationship and then run the local-vni command to re-create a binding relationship.When an EVPL instance is deleted, its binding relationship with a VNI is also deleted."
