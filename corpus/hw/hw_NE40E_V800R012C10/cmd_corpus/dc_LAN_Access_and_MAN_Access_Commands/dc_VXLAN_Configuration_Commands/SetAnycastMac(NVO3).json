    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIn VTEP all-active access scenarios, the NVE interfaces on all-active devices must have the same source VTEP MAC address. To set a VTEP MAC address to control the MAC extension attribute carried in EVPN BGP routes, run the mac-address command.\nIf no VTEP MAC address is configured, the MAC address of an NVE interface on an all-active device is the system MAC address. In this case, VTEP functions become unavailable."
