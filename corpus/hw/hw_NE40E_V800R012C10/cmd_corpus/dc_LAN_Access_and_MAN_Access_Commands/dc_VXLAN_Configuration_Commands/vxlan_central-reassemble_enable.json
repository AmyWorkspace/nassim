    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a VXLAN tunnel is established over a trunk that uses per-packet load balancing, two fragments of a packet may be transmitted through different boards. Therefore, the peer device will receive the two fragments through different boards and reassemble the fragments separately. If reassembly times out on one board, packet reassembly fails. To prevent reassembly failures caused by reassembly timeout on a board, run the vxlan central-reassemble enable command to enable centralized inter-board reassembly on VXLAN tunnels. This allows the receive device to select a board in the Up state for each VXLAN tunnel to reassemble fragments received from different boards.\nAfter this command is run, all VXLAN tunnels use centralized inter-board reassembly."
