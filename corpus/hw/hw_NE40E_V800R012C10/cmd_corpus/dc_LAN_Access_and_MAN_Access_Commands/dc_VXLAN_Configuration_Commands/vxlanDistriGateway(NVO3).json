    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo enable distributed gateway on a VBDIF interface and allow the gateway to learn only user-side ARP, ND, or DHCP packets, run the\nvxlan anycast-gateway enable command. After distributed gateway is enabled, the gateway:\nProcesses only received user-side ARP, ND, or DHCP packets and generates host routes accordingly.Deletes network-side ARP, ND, or DHCP entries already learned and deletes the corresponding host routes.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter distributed gateway is enabled:\nVXLAN tunnel-side static ARP, ND, or DHCP entries cannot be configured on the gateway.If distributed gateways have the same IP address, they do not report ARP, ND, or DHCP conflicts.If ARP proxy is not enabled but the network-side devices and user-side hosts have the same IP address, the gateways do not report IP address conflict alarms."
