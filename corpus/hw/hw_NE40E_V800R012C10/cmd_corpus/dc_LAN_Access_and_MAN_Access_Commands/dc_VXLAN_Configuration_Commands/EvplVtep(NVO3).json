    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen configuring a VXLAN tunnel, first configure an IP address for the source VTEP. This IP address serves as the source IP address of VXLAN packets. Because a VXLAN tunnel is established between a source VTEP and a peer VTEP, a different IP address also needs to be configured for the peer VTEP. This IP address serves as the destination IP address in VXLAN packets.\nDuring P2P VXLAN configuration, run the vtep-src command to configure an IP address for the source VTEP of the VXLAN tunnel bound to an EVPL instance.\nPrecautions\nIf the vtep-src command is not run for an EVPL instance, a VXLAN tunnel of the EVPL instance uses the NVE interface's source address as the source VTEP address. If the vtep-src command is run for an EVPL instance, a VXLAN tunnel of the EVPL instance uses the address specified in the command by preference."
