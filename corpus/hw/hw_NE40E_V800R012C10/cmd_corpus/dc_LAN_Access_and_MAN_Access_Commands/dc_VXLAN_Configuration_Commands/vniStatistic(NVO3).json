    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, VXLAN traffic statistics collection is disabled. Before you check VXLAN traffic statistics of a VNI for fault locating, run the statistic enable command in the VNI view to enable VXLAN traffic statistics collection. If traffic statistics collection is not enabled for a VNI, you cannot obtain the VXLAN traffic statistics of the VNI.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a large number of VXLAN packets exist, the device counts all these packets and subsequently stores large amounts of statistics, causing device operation performance to deteriorate. If VXLAN traffic statistics collection is not needed, run the undo statistic enable command to disable the function.\nFollow-up Procedure\nRun the display vxlan statistics vni vni-id command to view traffic statistics based on a specified VNI ID. The command output helps locate faults."
