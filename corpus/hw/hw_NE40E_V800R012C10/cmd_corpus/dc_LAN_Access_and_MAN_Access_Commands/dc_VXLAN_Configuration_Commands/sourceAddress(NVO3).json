    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA VTEP is a VXLAN tunnel endpoint that encapsulates or decapsulates VXLAN packets. It is represented by a network virtualization edge (NVE).\nTo configure an IP address for a source VTEP, run the source command. In VXLAN packets, the source IP address is the source VTEP's IP address, and the destination IP address is a remote VTEP's IP address. This pair of VTEP addresses corresponds to a VXLAN tunnel.\nPrecautions\nEither a physical interface's IP address or loopback interface address can be specified for a source VTEP. Using the loopback interface address as the source VTEP's IP address is recommended.\nGenerally, you need to configure different VTEP IP addresses for the NVE interfaces of different devices; otherwise, traffic forwarding error may occur. However, in some special scenarios (for example, a multi-active VXLAN gateways scenario), you need to configure the same VTEP IP address for the gateways' NVE interfaces."
