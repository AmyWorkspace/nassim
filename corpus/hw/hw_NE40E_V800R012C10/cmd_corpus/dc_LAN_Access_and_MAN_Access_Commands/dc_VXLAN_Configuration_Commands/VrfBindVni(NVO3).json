    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo isolate tenants at Layer 3, VPN is generally used. In a distributed VXLAN gateway scenario, to implement Layer 3 communication through a Layer 3 gateway, the Layer 3 gateway must be bound to a VPN instance.\nThe Layer 3 gateway assigns a Layer 2 VNI to each tenants and a Layer 3 VNI to each tenant identified by a VPN instance. To bind a VNI to a VPN instance, run the vxlan vni command. During Layer 3 communication through the Layer 3 gateway, the VNI ID bound to the VPN instance is transmitted to the remote Layer 3 gateway through the VXLAN tunnel. The remote Layer 3 gateway identifies VPNs based on tenants' VNI IDs to determine whether tenants belong to the same VPN for communication or isolation purposes.\nPrecautions\nA VNI can be bound only to one VPN instance.\nThe VNI bound to a VPN instance cannot be bound to a BD."
