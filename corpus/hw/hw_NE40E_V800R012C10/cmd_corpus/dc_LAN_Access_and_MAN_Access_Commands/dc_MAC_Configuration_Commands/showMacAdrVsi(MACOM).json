    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nA MAC address table is an interface-based Layer 2 forwarding table. It stores information about MAC addresses learned by a device. A MAC address entry contains a MAC address, an interface on which a packet is forwarded to this MAC address, and a VLAN to which the specified interface belongs or a VSI to which the specified interface is bound. Before forwarding a packet, the device searches the MAC address table based on the destination MAC address of the packet and locate the outbound interface quickly. This facilitates packet forwarding and reduces broadcast traffic.\nDynamic MAC address entries: obtained by a device through source MAC address learning and will be aged based on the aging time.\nTo view information about dynamic MAC address entries on the current VSI network, run the display mac-address dynamic vsi command."
