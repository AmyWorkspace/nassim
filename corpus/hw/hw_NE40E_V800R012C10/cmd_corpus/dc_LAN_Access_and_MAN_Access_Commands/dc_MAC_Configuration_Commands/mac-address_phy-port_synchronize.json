    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, MAC addresses are not synchronized on physical interfaces. If a device has both logical and physical interfaces and the outbound interface for uplink traffic with the same source MAC address alternates between an Eth-Trunk interface (a logical interface) and a physical interface, the physical interface cannot learn correct MAC address entries, resulting in a traffic forwarding failure. To resolve this problem, run the mac-address phy-port synchronize enable command to enable immediate MAC address synchronization on physical interfaces.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter this command is configured, if a Layer 2 loop occurs, there is a possibility that CPU usage is high. You can enable MAC flapping-based loop detection to prevent high CPU usage.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
