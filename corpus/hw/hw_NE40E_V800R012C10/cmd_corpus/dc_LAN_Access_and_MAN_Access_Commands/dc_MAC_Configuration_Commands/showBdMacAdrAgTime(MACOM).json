    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter multiple bridge domains are configured on a device, to view the aging time for dynamic MAC address entries in a specified bridge domain, run the display mac-address aging-time bridge-domain command in the BD view. To set the aging time, run the mac-address aging-time (Bridge domain view) command. The command output helps verify the configuration and analyze faults.\nPrecautions\nIf a MAC address entry does not age, the aging time in the command output is 0s.\nIf a great number of bridge domains are configured on a device, configure bd-id in the display mac-address aging-time bridge-domain command to view information about a specified bridge domain."
