    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo control the number of users and protect a MAC address table against attacks, you can limit the number of MAC addresses that a device can learn. You can also configure the system to discard packets or generate an alarm to improve network security.\nConfiguring interface-based MAC address learning limit rule can control the number of access users on an interface. When the number of MAC addresses reaches the limit, no new MAC addresses will be learned. You can also configure the system to discard packets or generate an alarm to improve network security.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter a MAC address learning limit rule is configured on an interface using the mac-limit command, a global MAC address learning limit rule cannot be applied on the interface using the mac-limit rule-name command.\nTrustworthy MAC addresses may not be recorded after the number of learned MAC addresses reaches the limit. If an enterprise or a family is attacked by different source MAC addresses, only the network of the enterprise or family, not the whole network is affected.\nPrecautions\nBefore configuring a MAC address learning limit rule, run the reset mac-address command to clear the learned MAC addresses to ensure that the number of MAC addresses that can be learned is limited accurately.\nBefore running this command in the tunnel interface view, run the tunnel-protocol command to specify the GRE tunnel mode for the tunnel interface.\nMAC address limitation is not supported on VE interfaces."
