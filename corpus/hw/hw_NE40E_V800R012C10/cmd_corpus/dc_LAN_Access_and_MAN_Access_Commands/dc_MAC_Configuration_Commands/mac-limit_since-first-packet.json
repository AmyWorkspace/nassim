    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen MAC address learning limit is configured both on an interface and in a broadcast domain, MAC address learning limit in the broadcast domain takes effect after a delay. As a result, some traffic enters downstream devices for a short time. To resolve the problem, run the mac-limit since-first-packet command to enable the first packet's MAC address learning of MAC address learning limit on an interface. After the configuration, MAC address learning limit in the broadcast domain takes effect immediately."
