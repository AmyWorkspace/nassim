    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBefore you run the display bridge-domain statistics command to check statistics about discarded BUM packets in a BD for fault locating, run the statistic discard enable command in the BD view to enable the function to collect discarded BUM packets in a BD. If you do not enable the function, statistics about discarded BUM packets in a BD cannot be collected.\nPrerequisites\nPacket statistics collection in a BD has been enabled using the statistic enable command.\nFollow-up Procedure\nAfter the statistic discard enable command is run, run the display bridge-domain statistics command to check statistics about discarded BUM packets in a BD. The command output helps diagnose faults.\nPrecautions\nRunning the undo statistic enable command disables the function to collect statistics about discarded BUM packets."
