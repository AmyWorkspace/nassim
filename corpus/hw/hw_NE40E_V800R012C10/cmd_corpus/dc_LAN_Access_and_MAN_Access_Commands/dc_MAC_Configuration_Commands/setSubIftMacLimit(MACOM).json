You can also configure the system to discard packets or generate an alarm to improve network security.\nTo apply a global MAC address learning limit rule on an interface, run the mac-limit rule-name command in the sub-interface view.\nConfiguration Impact\nIf a global MAC address learning limit rule has been applied on an interface, another MAC address learning rule cannot be configured on the interface using the mac-limit command.\nPrecautions\nGE interface, and Eth-Trunk interface must be Layer 2 interfaces."
