    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nMappings between instances and VLANs need to be configured on a network running a Layer 2 ring protocol such as Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP). Before configuring such mappings, run the vlan instance command to display the VLAN instance view. This command applies to all ring protocols, facilitating configurations.\nPrerequisites\nAll mappings between MSTIs and VLANs configured in the MST region view have been deleted using the undo stp region-configuration command.\nPrecautions\nThe vlan instance and stp region-configuration commands are manually exclusive. The vlan-instance command takes effect only after the MSTI-VLAN mappings configured using the stp region-configuration command are deleted."
