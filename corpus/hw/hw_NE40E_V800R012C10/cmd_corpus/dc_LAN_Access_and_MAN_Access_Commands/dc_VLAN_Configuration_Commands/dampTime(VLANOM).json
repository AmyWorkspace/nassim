    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a VLAN Down event occurs when all the interfaces added to the VLAN go Down, the VLAN will report the Down event to the VLANIF interface, causing a change in the VLANIF interface status. The master/slave switchover will cause the VLANIF interface to alternate frequently between Up and Down. As a result, network flapping occurs. To avoid this, run the damping time command on the VLANIF interface to enable VLAN damping. Among all the interfaces that are added to the VLAN, if the last Up interface in the VLAN becomes Down, the device enabled with VLAN damping will report the VLAN status to the VLANIF interface before the configured delay time expires. If some interfaces in the VLAN become Up before the configured delay time expires, the VLANIF interface stays Up."
