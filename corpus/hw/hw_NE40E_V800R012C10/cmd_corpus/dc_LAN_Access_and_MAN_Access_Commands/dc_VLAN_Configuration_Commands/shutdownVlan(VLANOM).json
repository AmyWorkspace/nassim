    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a VLAN is faulty or needs to be masked, run the shutdown vlan command to change the VLAN to the Down state. After the VLAN enters the Down state, users cannot communicate within the VLAN.\nConfiguration Impact\nThe shutdown vlan command takes effect only on the VLANs on which the command is run.\nIf you have added an interface to a specific VLAN using the port trunk allow-pass vlan or port default vlan command, after you run the shutdown vlan command in the view of the specific VLAN, the interface in the VLAN cannot forward data with the VLAN ID.\nPrecautions\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.Traffic on a VLANIF interface includes Layer 2 and Layer 3 traffic. Running the shutdown vlan command forbids all traffic on the VLANIF interface, whereas running the shutdown command only forbids Layer 3 traffic, but not Layer 2 traffic.\nIn VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS."
