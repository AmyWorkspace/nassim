    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo reduce broadcast domains and enhance security on a complex network, VLANs can be created on the network to isolate the devices that do not need to communicate with each other.\nPrecautions\nThe vlan command creates a VLAN and displays the VLAN view. If a VLAN has been created, the VLAN view is displayed after this command is used. If you run the vlan command more than once, all the created VLANs take effect. If a VLAN has been created, using this command does not create the same VLAN or modify the VLAN configuration. After a VLAN is created, both the vlan and vlan batch configurations exist in the configuration file."
