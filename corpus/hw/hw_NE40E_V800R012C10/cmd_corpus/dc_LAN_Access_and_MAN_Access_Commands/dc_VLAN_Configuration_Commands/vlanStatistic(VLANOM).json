    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nBy default, VLAN packet statistics collection is disabled. Before viewing VLAN packet statistics of a specified interface for fault location, run the statistics enable command to enable VLAN packet statistics collection.\nPrerequisites\nThe VLAN has been created using the vlan command in the system view.\nA Layer 2 Ethernet interface has been added to the VLAN. If the interface is a Layer 3 Ethernet interface, run the portswitch command in the interface view to switch the interface to a Layer 2 interface.\nIf the Layer 2 Ethernet interface directly connects to a user terminal,Configure the Layer 2 Ethernet interface as an access interface using the port link-type access command.Add the access interface to the VLAN using the port default vlan vlan-id command.If the Layer 2 Ethernet interface connects to an interface of another switching device,Configure the interface as a trunk interface using the port link-type trunk command to configure the interface as a trunk interface.Add the trunk interface to specified VLANs using the port trunk allow-pass vlan command.\n\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter running the statistic enable command, you can run the display vlan statistics command to view VLAN packet statistics, which help locate faults."
