    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nTo run the outside-vlan port isolate command on a Layer 3 interface, first switch the interface to a Layer 2 interface using the portswitch command.\nAfter you run the outside-vlan port isolate command on interfaces that must be isolated from each other, these interfaces cannot communicate with each other.\nBefore running the outside-vlan port isolate command, ensure that VLAN stacking or VLAN mapping has been configured on the interface. Otherwise, the outside-vlan port isolate command configuration does not take effect."
