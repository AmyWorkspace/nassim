    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAn EVC Layer 2 sub-interface can forward received broadcast packets to other EVC Layer 2 sub-interfaces in the same bridge domain. Forwarding malicious unknown unicast packets increases device resource consumption. As a result, device performance deteriorates, or a device breaks down. To prevent an EVC Layer 2 sub-interface from forwarding broadcast packets to other EVC Layer 2 sub-interfaces in the same bridge domain, run the broadcast discard command.\nPrecautions\nThe broadcast discard command applies to networks without user changes or networks with static MAC address-based forwarding paths."
