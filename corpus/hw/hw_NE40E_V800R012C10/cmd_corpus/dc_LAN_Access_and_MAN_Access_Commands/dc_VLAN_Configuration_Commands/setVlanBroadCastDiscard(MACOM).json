    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen an interface in a VLAN receives a broadcast packet or a unicast packet, it searches the MAC address table for the destination MAC address. If no destination MAC address is found, the interface broadcasts the packet to other interfaces in this VLAN.\nWhen static MAC address entries are configured, run the broadcast discard command to disable forwarding of broadcast packets within a VLAN. This improves network security by limiting attack broadcast packets."
