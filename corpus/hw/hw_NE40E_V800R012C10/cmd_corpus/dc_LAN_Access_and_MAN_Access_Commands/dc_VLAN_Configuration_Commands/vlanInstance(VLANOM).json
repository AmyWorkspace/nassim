    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nWhen you configure a Layer 2 ring protocol such as Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), run the instance vlan command in the VLAN instance view to configure mappings between a Layer 2 ring protocol instance and VLANs. This command applies to all ring protocols, facilitating configurations.\nConfiguration Impact\nAfter you run the undo instance vlan command to delete mappings between a specified instance and VLANs, these VLANs will be remapped to instance 0.\nIf the instance vlan command is run more than once, all configurations take effect."
