    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a loop occurs on a network, the broadcast domain encounters broadcast storms. To prevent other broadcast domains from being affected, traffic suppression of MAC flapping-based loop detection must be enabled.\nTraffic suppression of MAC flapping-based loop detection takes effect only after the following conditions are met:\nThe MAC flapping-based loop detection function is not configured, or the alarm function is configured for MAC flapping-based loop detection.MAC flapping is detected, and traffic surges on the interface or PW that encounters MAC flapping.No thresholds are configured in an interface view for broadcast, multicast, or unknown unicast traffic that the interface allows to pass.No thresholds are configured in a VSI or PW view for broadcast, multicast, or unknown unicast traffic that VPLS allows to pass.Traffic suppression of MAC flapping-based loop detection is enabled by default. When the network topology becomes stable and no loops occur, run the loop-detect traffic-suppression disable command to disable this function."
