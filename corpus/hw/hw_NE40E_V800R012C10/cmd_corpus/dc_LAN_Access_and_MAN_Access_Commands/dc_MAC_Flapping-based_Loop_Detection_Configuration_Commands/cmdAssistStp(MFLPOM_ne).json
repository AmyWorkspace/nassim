    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nOn an STP-capable Layer 2 network, packets with the same source MAC address may form loops. To prevent loops, an interface must be blocked, and an alarm must be reported to the NMS. However, STP and MAC flapping-based loop detection are mutually exclusive by default. To allow both STP and MAC-flapping-based loop detection to be enabled, run the loop-detect eth-loop assist-stp enable command.\nPrecautions\nIf the undo loop-detect eth-loop assist-stp enable command is run after both STP and MAC flapping-based loop detection are enabled, neither of the two configurations is deleted. The undo loop-detect eth-loop assist-stp enable command can be executed only after STP or MAC flapping-based loop detection is disabled.STP and MAC flapping-based loop detection have different blocking principles and may block different interfaces on a network, leading to temporary traffic interruptions. Therefore, exercise caution when running the loop-detect eth-loop assist-stp enable command."
