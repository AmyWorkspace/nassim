    "FuncDef": "The loop-detect eth-loop precise-block policy no-block command prevents a device from blocking any interfaces with MAC address entry flapping in a virtual switching instance (VSI), a virtual local area network (VLAN) or a Bridge-Domain (BD) when the device does not have any trusted interfaces.\nThe undo loop-detect eth-loop precise-block policy no-block command restores the default configuration.\nBy default, if a device does not have any trusted interfaces and if MAC address entry flapping occurs on multiple interfaces , the device blocks the interfaces with lower blocking priorities.",

    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf all dynamic MAC address entries flap within the interval for generating a trusted interface (the interval is configured using the loop-detect eth-loop precise-block trust-port generate-time generate-time command), no trusted interface is generated. In this situation, accurate blocking of MAC flapping-based loop detection cannot be performed. You can run the loop-detect eth-loop precise-block policy no-block command to prevent a device from blocking any interfaces with MAC address entry flapping when the device does not have any trusted interfaces."
