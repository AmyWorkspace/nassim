    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter MAC flapping-based loop detection is enabled in the BD view using the loop-detect eth-loop command, the device blocks an AC-side interface that has MAC address entry flapping occurred based on the blocking priorities of interfaces configured using the loop-detect eth-loop priority. This configuration enables the device to eliminate loops. However, MAC address entries of interfaces without loops may change due to the impact from a remote loop, and traffic over the interfaces with lower blocking priorities is interrupted.\nTo address this problem, run the loop-detect eth-loop precise-block enable command to enable accurate blocking of MAC flapping-based loop detection. Accurate blocking determines trusted and untrusted interfaces by analyzing the frequency of MAC address entry flapping. When a MAC address entry changes repeatedly, accurate blocking can accurately locate and block the interface (untrusted) with a loop."
