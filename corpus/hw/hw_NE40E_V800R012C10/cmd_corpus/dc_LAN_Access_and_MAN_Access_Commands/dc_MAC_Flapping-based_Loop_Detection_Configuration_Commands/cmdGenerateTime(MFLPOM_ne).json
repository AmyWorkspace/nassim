    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a dynamic MAC address entry remains the same in the MAC address table within a specified period and is not deleted, in a scenario where accurate blocking policy is enabled. The outbound interface in the MAC address entry is trusted. To configure an interval at which a trusted interface is generated, run the loop-detect eth-loop precise-block trust-port command.\nPrecautions\nTrusted interfaces are changeable and the latest trusted interfaces are used. To ensure the correctness of trusted interfaces, specify the interval at which trusted interfaces are generated to a period shorter than the aging time of dynamic MAC address entries"
