    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nIf a loop occurs on a network, the broadcast domain encounters broadcast storms. To prevent other broadcast domains from being affected, traffic suppression of MAC flapping-based loop detection must be enabled. When traffic suppression of MAC flapping-based loop detection is enabled, run the loop-detect traffic-suppression threshold suppression-threshold to set a threshold. The system implements traffic suppression based on the threshold."
