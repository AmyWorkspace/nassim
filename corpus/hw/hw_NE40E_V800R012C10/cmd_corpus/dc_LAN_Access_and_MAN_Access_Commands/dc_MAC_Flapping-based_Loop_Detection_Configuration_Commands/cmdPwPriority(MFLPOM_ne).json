    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario\nAfter MAC flapping-based loop detection is configured on devices of a virtual private LAN service (VPLS) network, if a device detects a loop, the device blocks a PW based on its blocking priority. To configure the blocking priority of an interface or a PW, run the loop-detect eth-loop priority command.\nPrecautions\nBy default, a PW for MAC flapping-based loop detection has no default value, so no PW is blocked. To allow a PW to be blocked, configure the blocking priority of a PW for MAC flapping-based loop detection.\nIf a loop occurs and the AC-side interfaces or PWs have the same blocking priority, the AC-side interfaces or PWs are all blocked.\nIf MAC flapping-based loop detection is configured for a VSI using the loop-detect eth-loop loop-times loop-times detect-cycle detect-cycle-time cycles cycles command with detect-cycle-time and cycles specified and a blocking priority is configured on an interface bound to the VSI using the loop-detect eth-loop priority priority command, the detection cycle is as follows:\nIf priority is 1, the detection cycle is calculated as follows: Detection cycle = 1 x detect-cycle-time x cyclesIf priority is 2, the detection cycle is calculated as follows: Detection cycle = 4 x detect-cycle-time x cyclesIf priority is 3, the detection cycle is calculated as follows: Detection cycle = 8 x detect-cycle-time x cyclesIf priority is 4, the interface is never blocked, and the MAC flapping-based loop detection function does not take effect.\nHigh-priority interfaces have a longer detection time, and low-priority interfaces are preferentially blocked if the MAC flapping based-loop detection function detects a loop."
