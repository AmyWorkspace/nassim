The specified policer-id must already exist within thesap-ingressQoS policy. While the system is determining the forwarding class of a packet, it is also looking up its forwarding destination based on the ingress service type and the service instance forwarding records. If the service type is VPLS and the destination MAC address is unicast, but the MAC has not been learned and populated within the VPLS services FDB, the packet is classified into the unknown forwarding type.",
