    "FuncDef": "This command is used to define how the policer s configuration parameters are translated into the underlying hardware capabilities used to implement each policer instance. For instance, the configured rates for the policer need to be mapped to the timers and decrement granularity used by the hardware's leaky bucket functions that actually perform the traffic metering. If a rate is defined that cannot be exactly matched by the hardware, the adaptation-rule setting provides guidance for which hardware rate should be used.",
