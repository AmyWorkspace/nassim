    "FuncDef": "This command is used in a SAP ingress QoS policy to define an explicit out-of-profile remark action for a forwarding class or subclass. While the SAP ingress QoS policy may be applied to any SAP, the remarking functions are only enforced when the SAP is associated with an IP or subscriber interface (in an IES or VPRN). When the policy is applied to a Layer 2 SAP (for example, Epipe or VPLS), the remarking definitions are silently ignored.",
