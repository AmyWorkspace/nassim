    "PageTitle": "percent-rate",
    "FuncDef": "This command configures a queue's PIR and CIR as a percentage of the ingress port line rate or as a percentage of its parent scheduler rate. When the rates are expressed as aport-limit, the actual rates used per instance of the queue will vary based on the port speed. For example, when the same QoS policy is used on a 1 Gb and a 10 Gb Ethernet port, the queue's rates will be 10 times greater on the 10 Gb port due to the difference in port speeds. This enables the same QoS policy to be used on SAPs on different ports without needing to use SAP-based queue overrides to modify a queue's rate to get the same relative performance from the queue.",
