    "FuncDef": "Within a sap-ingress QoS policy forwarding class context, thepolicercommand is used to map packets that match the forwarding class and are considered unicast in nature to the specified policer-id. The specified policer-id must already exist within thesap-ingressQoS policy. While the system is determining the forwarding class of a packet, it is also looking up its forwarding destination. If ingress forwarding logic has resolved a unicast destination (the packet does not need to be sent to multiple destinations), it is considered to be a unicast packet and will be mapped to either an ingress queue (using thequeuequeue-idorqueuequeue-idgroupingress-queue-groupcommands) or an ingress policer (policerpolicer-id). Thequeueandpolicercommands\nwithin the forwarding class context are mutually exclusive. By default, the unicast forwarding type is mapped to the SAP ingress default queue (queue 1). If thepolicerpolicer-idcommand is executed, any previous policer mapping or queue mapping for the unicast forwarding type within the forwarding class is overridden if the policer mapping is successful.",
