In the event that an ingress packet does not match a higher priority (more explicit) classification command, the default forwarding class or subclass will be associated with the packet. Unless overridden by an explicit forwarding class classification rule, all packets received on an ingress SAP using this ingress QoS policy will be classified to the default forwarding class. Optionally, the default ingress enqueuing priority for the traffic can be overridden as well.",
