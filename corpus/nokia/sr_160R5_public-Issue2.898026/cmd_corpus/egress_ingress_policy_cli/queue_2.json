Point-to-point services include Epipe and other VLL type services. Multipoint services include IES, VPLS, and VPRN services. The queue command does not apply to multicast, broadcast, or unknown unicast packets within multipoint services (the multicast, broadcast, and unknown commands must be used to define the queue mapping for non-unicast packets within a forwarding class). For Epipe, thequeuequeue-idmapping applies to all packets, regardless of the packets destination MAC address.",
