    "FuncDef": "This command adds or subtracts the specified number of bytes to the accounting function for each packet handled by the HSMDA queue. Normally, the accounting and leaky bucket functions are based on the 14-byte Ethernet DLC header, 4-byte or 8-byte VLAN tag (optional), 20-byte IP header, IP payload, and the 4-byte CRC (everything except the preamble and inter-frame gap). For example, the packet-byte-offset command can be used to add the frame encapsulation overhead (20 bytes) to the queues accounting functions.",
