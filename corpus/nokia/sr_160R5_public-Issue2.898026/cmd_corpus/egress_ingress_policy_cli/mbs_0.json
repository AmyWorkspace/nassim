Thehigh-prio-onlycommand is applied to the MBS value to derive the bucket s low-priority violate threshold. For ingress, trusted in-profile packets and untrusted high-priority packets use the policer s high-priority violate threshold while trusted out-of-profile and untrusted low-priority packets use the policer's low-priority violate threshold. At egress, inplus-profile, and in-profile packets use the policer s high-priority violate threshold and out-of-profile packets use the policer's low-priority violate threshold. Exceed-profile packets are discarded unlessenable-exceed-piris configured, in which case they are forwarded.",
