Dynamic policers are instantiated and terminated on demand due to an action request submitted by the policy server (for example, via Gx interface). The actions types behind dynamic policers are typically related to rate-limiting or volume monitoring. The dynamic-policers can be instantiated on demand at any time during the lifetime of the sla-profile instance.",
