    "FuncDef": "This command configures the matching of the second tag that is carried transparently through the service. The inner tag on ingress is the second tag on the frame if there are no service delimiting tags. The inner tag is the second tag before any service delimiting tags on egress, but is dependent in the ingress configuration and may be set to 0 even in cases where additional tags are on the frame. This allows matching VLAN tags for explicit filtering or QoS setting when using default or null encapsulations.",
