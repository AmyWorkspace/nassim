    "FuncDef": "This command modifies the size of each packet handled by the queue by adding or subtracting the specified number of bytes. The actual packet size is not modified; only the size used to determine the ingress scheduling and profiling is changed. Thepacket-byte-offsetcommand is an arbitrary mechanism that can be used to either add downstream frame encapsulation or remove portions of packet headers. Both the scheduling and profiling throughput is affected by the offset as well as the statistics (accounting) associated with the queue. Thepacket-byte-offsetdoes not apply to drop statistics, received valid statistics, or the offered managed and unmanaged statistics used by Ingress Multicast Path Management.",
