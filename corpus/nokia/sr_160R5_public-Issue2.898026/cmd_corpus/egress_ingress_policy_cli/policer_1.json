    "FuncDef": "This command is used in the sap-ingress and sap-egress QoS policies to create, modify, or delete a policer. Policers are created and used in a similar manner to queues. The policer ID space is separate from the queue ID space, allowing both a queue and a policer to share the same ID. The sap-ingress policy may be defined to have up to 63 policers (numbered 1 through 63) while the sap-egress QoS policy supports a maximum of 8 (numbered 1 through 8). While a policer may be defined within a QoS policy, it is not actually created on SAPs or subscribers or multiservice sites associated with the policy until a forwarding class is mapped to the policer s ID.",

If the specified ID already exists, the system enters that policer's context to allow the policer s parameters to be modified. If the ID does not exist and is within the allowed range for the QoS policy type, a context for the policer ID will be created (depending on the system's current create keyword requirements, which may require the create keyword to actually add the new policer ID to the QoS policy) and the system will enter that new policer s context for possible parameter modification.
