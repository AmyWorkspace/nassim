    "FuncDef": "This command explicitly sets the forwarding class or subclass or enqueuing priority when a packet is marked with adot1p-priorityspecified. Adding a dot1p rule on the policy forces packets that match thedot1p-priorityspecified to override the forwarding class and enqueuing priority based on the parameters included in the dot1p rule. When the forwarding class is not specified in the rule, a matching packet preserves (or inherits) the existing forwarding class derived from earlier matches in the classification hierarchy. When the enqueuing priority is not specified in the rule, a matching packet preserves (or inherits) the existing enqueuing priority derived from earlier matches in the classification hierarchy.",
