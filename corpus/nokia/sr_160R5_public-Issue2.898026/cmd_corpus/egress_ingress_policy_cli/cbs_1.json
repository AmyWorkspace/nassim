It is permissible, and possibly desirable, to oversubscribe the total CBS reserved buffers for a given access port egress buffer pool. Oversubscription may be desirable due to the potentially large number of service queues and the economy of statistical multiplexing the individual queue s CBS settings into the defined reserved total.",
