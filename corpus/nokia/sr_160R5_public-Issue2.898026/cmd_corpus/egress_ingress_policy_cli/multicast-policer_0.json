    "FuncDef": "Within asap-ingressQoS policy forwarding class context, themulticast-policercommand is used to map packets that match the forwarding class and are considered multicast in nature to the specified policer-id. The specified policer-id must already exist within thesap-ingressQoS policy. While the system is determining the forwarding class of a packet, it is also looking up its forwarding destination based on the ingress service type and the service instance forwarding records. Two basic types of services support multicast packets: routed services (IES and VPRN) and L2 multipoint services (VPLS, I-VPLS, and B-VPLS). For the routed service types, a multicast packet is destined to an IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address. For the L2 multipoint services, a multicast packet is a packet destined to a multicast MAC address (multicast bit set in the destination MAC address but not the ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff broadcast address). The\nVPLS services also support two other multipoint forwarding types (broadcast and unknown), which are considered separate from the multicast forwarding type.",
