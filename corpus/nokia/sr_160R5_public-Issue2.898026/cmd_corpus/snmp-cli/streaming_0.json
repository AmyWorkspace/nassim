    "FuncDef": "This command enables the proprietary SNMP request/response bundling and TCP-based transport mechanism for optimizing network management of the router nodes. In higher latency networks, synchronizing router MIBs from network management via streaming takes less time than synchronizing via classic SNMP UDP requests. Streaming operates on TCP port 1491 and runs over IPv4 or IPv6.",
