    "FuncDef": "This command is applicable only to LNS. It determines the time during which the LNS keeps fragments of the same packet in the buffer before it discards them. The assumption is that if the fragments do not arrive within certain time, the chance is that they were lost somewhere in the network. In this case the partial packet cannot be reassembled and all fragments that has arrived up to this point and are stored in the buffer IS discarded in order to free up the buffer. Otherwise, a condition arises in which partial packets are held in the buffer until the buffer is exhausted.",
