    "FuncDef": "This command enables IS-IS graceful restart (GR) to minimize service interruption. When the control plane of a GR-capable router fails or restarts, the neighboring routers (GR helpers) temporarily preserve IS-IS forwarding information. Traffic continues to be forwarded to the restarting router using the last known forwarding tables. If the control plane of the restarting router becomes operationally and administratively up within the grace period, the restarting router resumes normal IS-IS operation. If the grace period expires, then the restarting router is presumed inactive and the IS-IS topology is recalculated to route traffic around the failure.",
