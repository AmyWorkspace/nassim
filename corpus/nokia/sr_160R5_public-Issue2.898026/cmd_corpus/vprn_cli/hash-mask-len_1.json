    "FuncDef": "This command is used to configure the length of a mask that is to be combined with the group address before the hash function is called. All groups with the same hash map to the same RP. For example, if this value is 24, only the first 24 bits of the group addresses matter. This mechanism is used to map one group or multiple groups to an RP.",
