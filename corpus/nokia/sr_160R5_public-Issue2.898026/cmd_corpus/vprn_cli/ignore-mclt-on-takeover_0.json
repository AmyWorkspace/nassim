    "FuncDef": "With this flag enabled, the  remote  IP address/prefix can be taken over immediately upon entering the PARTNER-DOWN state of the intercommunication link, without having to wait for the MCLT to expire. By setting this flag, the lease times of the existing DHCP clients, while the intercommunication link is in the PARTNER-DOWN state, will still be reduced to the MCLT over time and all new lease times will be set to MCLT. This behavior remain the same as originally intended for MCLT.",
