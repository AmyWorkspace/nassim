    "FuncDef": "This command defines the maximum interval between two consecutive SPF calculations in milliseconds. Timers that determine when to initiate the first, second, and subsequent SPF calculations after a topology change occurs can be controlled with this command. Subsequent SPF runs (if required) will occur at exponentially increasing intervals of thespf-second-waitinterval. For example, if thespf-second-waitinterval is 1000, then the next SPF will run after 2000 milliseconds, and then next SPF will run after 4000 milliseconds, and so on, until it reaches thespf-waitvalue. The SPF interval will stay at thespf-waitvalue until there are no more SPF runs scheduled in that interval. After a full interval without any SPF runs, the SPF interval will drop back tospf-initial-wait.",
