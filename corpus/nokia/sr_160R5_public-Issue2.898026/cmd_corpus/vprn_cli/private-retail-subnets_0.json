    "FuncDef": "This command controls the export of subnets to the forwarding service. When this attribute is configured, subnets defined on this retail subscriber interface will no longer be exported to the associated wholesale VPRN and will remain private to the retail VPRN. This is useful in a PPPoE business service context as it allows retail services to use overlapping IP address spaces even if these services are associated with the same wholesale service.",
