    "FuncDef": "This command configures the poll interval, in seconds. The poll interval is the time between two Hello packets to a dead (non-adjacent) OSPF NBMA neighbor. The default value of the poll interval timer is higher than the hello interval timer to avoid wasting bandwidth on non-broadcast networks, since OSPF messages are unicast to each configured neighbor. The poll interval timer is used only onnon-broadcastinterface types and has no effect if configured on other interface types.",
