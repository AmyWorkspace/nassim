    "FuncDef": "This command enables a non-MI capable router to establish an adjacency and operate with an SR OS in a non-zero instance. If the router does not receive IID-TLVs, it will establish an adjacency in a single instance. Instead of establishing an adjacency in the standard instance 0, the router will establish an adjacency in the configured non-zero instance. The router will then operate in the configured non-zero instance so that it appears to be in the standard instance 0 to its neighbor. This feature is supported on point-to-point interfaces, broadcast interfaces are not supported.",
