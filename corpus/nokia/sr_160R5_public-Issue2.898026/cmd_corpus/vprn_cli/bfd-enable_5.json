    "FuncDef": "This command enables the use of bi-directional forwarding (BFD) to control IPv4 adjacencies. By enabling BFD on an IPv4 or IPv6 protocol interface, the state of the protocol interface is tied to the state of the BFD session between the local node and the remote node. The parameters used for the BFD are set by the BFD command under the IP interface. This command must be given separately to enable/disable BFD for both IPv4 and IPv6.",
