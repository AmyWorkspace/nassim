    "FuncDef": "This command configures a virtual link to connect area border routers to the backbone via a virtual link. The backbone area (area 0.0.0.0) must be contiguous and all other areas must be connected to the backbone area. If it is not practical to connect an area to the backbone (see area 0.0.0.2 inFigure 53), then the area border routers (routers 1 and 2 inFigure 53) must be connected using a virtual link. The two area border routers will form a point-to-point like adjacency across the transit area (area 0.0.0.1 inFigure 53). A virtual link can only be configured while in the area 0.0.0.0 context.",
