    "FuncDef": "This command configures the weighted ECMP load-balancing weight for an IS-IS interface of the VPRN. If the interface becomes an ECMP next-hop for IPv4 or IPv6 route and all the other ECMP next-hops are interfaces with configured (non-zero) load-balancing weights, then the traffic distribution over the ECMP interfaces is proportional to the weights. In other words, the interface with the largest load-balancing-weight should receive the most forwarded traffic if weighted ECMP is applicable.",
