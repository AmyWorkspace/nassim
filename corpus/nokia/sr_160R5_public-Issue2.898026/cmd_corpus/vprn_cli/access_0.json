    "FuncDef": "This command enables/disables SNMP access on the VPRN interface. This command allows SNMP queries destined to the VPRN interface IP addresses for this VPRN (including VPRN interfaces that are bound to R-VPLS services) to be processed by the SNMP agent on the router.   SNMP queries that arrive on VPRN interfaces but are destined to IP addresses in the Base routing context that can be accessed in the VPRN (for example, the router system address via grt leaking) do not require snmp-access to be enabled but do require allow-local-management to be enabled.",
