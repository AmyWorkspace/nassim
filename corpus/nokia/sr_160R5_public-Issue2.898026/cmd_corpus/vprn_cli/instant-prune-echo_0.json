    "FuncDef": "This command enables PIM to send an instant prune echo when the router starts the prune pending timer for a group on the interface. All downstream routers will see the prune message immediately, and can send a join override if they are interested in receiving the group. Configuring instant-prune-echo is recommended on broadcast interfaces with more than one PIM neighbor to optimize multicast convergence.",
