    "FuncDef": "This command configures the option to join P2MP LDP tree towards the multicast source for the VPRN service. If p2mp-ldp-tree-join is enabled, a PIM multicast join received on an interface is processed to join P2MP LDP LSP using the in-band signaled P2MP tree for the same multicast flow. LDP P2MP tree is setup towards the multicast source. Route to source of the multicast node is looked up from the RTM. The next-hop address for the route to source is set as the root of LDP P2MP tree.",
