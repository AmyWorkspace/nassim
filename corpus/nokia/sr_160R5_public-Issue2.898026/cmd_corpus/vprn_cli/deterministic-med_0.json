    "FuncDef": "This command controls how the BGP decision process compares routes on the basis of MED. Whendeterministic-medis configured, BGP groups paths that are equal up to the MED comparison step based on neighbor AS, and then compares the best path from each group to arrive at the overall best path. This change to the BGP decision process makes best path selection completely deterministic in all cases. Withoutdeterministic-med, the overall best path selection is sometimes dependent on the order of the route arrival because of the rule that MED cannot be compared in routes from different neighbor AS.",
