    "FuncDef": "This command enables IS-IS multi-instance (MI) as described in draft-ginsberg-isis-mi-bis-01. Multiple instances allow instance-specific adjacencies to be formed that support multiple network topologies on the same physical interfaces. Each instance has an LSDB, and each PDU contains a TLV identifying the instance and the topology to which the PDU belongs. A single topology is supported in each instance, so the instance-specific topology identifier (ITID) is set to 0 and cannot be changed.",
