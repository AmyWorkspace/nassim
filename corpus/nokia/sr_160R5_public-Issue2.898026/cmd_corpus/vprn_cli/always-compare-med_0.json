    "FuncDef": "This command configures the comparison of BGP routes based on the MED attribute. The default behavior of SR-OS (equivalent to thenoform of the command) is to only compare two routes on the basis of MED if they have the same neighbor AS (the first non-confed AS in the received AS_PATH attribute). Also by default, a route without a MED attribute is handled the same as though it had a MED attribute with the value 0. Thealways-compare-medcommand without thestrict-askeyword allows MED to be compared even if the paths have a different neighbor AS; in this case, if neitherzeroorinfinityis specified, thezerooption is inferred, meaning a route without a MED is handled the same as though it had a MED attribute with the value 0. When thestrict-askeyword is present, MED is only compared between paths from the same neighbor AS,\nand in this case,zeroorinfinityis mandatory and tells BGP how to interpret paths without a MED attribute.",
