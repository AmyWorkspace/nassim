    "FuncDef": "This command starts or stops draining this NAT address range. When an address-range is being drained, it will not be used to serve new hosts. Existing hosts, however, will still be able to use the address that was assigned to them even if it is being drained. An address-range can only be deleted if the parent pool is shut down or if the range itself is effectively drained (no hosts are using the addresses anymore).",
