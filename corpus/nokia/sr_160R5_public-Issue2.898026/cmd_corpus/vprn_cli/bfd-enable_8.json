    "FuncDef": "This command enables bi-directional forwarding (BFD) to control the state of the associated protocol adjacency. By enabling BFD on a given protocol interface, the state of the RIP neighbor is tied to the state of the BFD session between the local node and the remote node. The parameters used for the BFD are set using the bfd command under the IP interface configuration context.",
