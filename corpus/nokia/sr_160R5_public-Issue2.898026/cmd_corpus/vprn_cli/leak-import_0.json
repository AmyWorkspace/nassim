    "FuncDef": "This command is used to specify route policies that control the importation of leak-eligible routes from the BGP RIB of another routing instance into the unlabeled-IPv4, unlabeled-IPv6, or labeled-IPv4 RIB of the base router. To leak a route from one routing instance to another, the origin and destination RIB types must be the same; for example, it is not possible to leak a route from an unlabeled-IPv4 RIB of a VPRN into the labeled-IPv4 RIB of the base router.",
