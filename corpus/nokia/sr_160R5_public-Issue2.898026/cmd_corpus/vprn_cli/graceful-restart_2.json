    "FuncDef": "This command enables OSPF graceful restart (GR) to minimize service interruption. When the control plane of a GR-capable router fails or restarts, the neighboring routers (GR helpers) temporarily preserve OSPF forwarding information. Traffic continues to be forwarded to the restarting router using the last known forwarding tables. If the control plane of the restarting router becomes operationally and administratively up within the grace period, the restarting router resumes normal OSPF operation. If the grace period expires, then the restarting router is presumed inactive and the OSPF topology is recalculated to route traffic around the failure.",
