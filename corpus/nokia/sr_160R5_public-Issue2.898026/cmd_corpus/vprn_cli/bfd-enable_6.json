    "FuncDef": "This command enables the use of bi-directional forwarding (BFD) to control the state of the associated protocol interface. By enabling BFD on a given protocol interface, the state of the protocol interface is tied to the state of the BFD session between the local node and the remote node.   The parameters used for the BFD are set via the BFD command under the IP interface.",
