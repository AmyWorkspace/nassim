Ifp2mp-ldp-tree-joinis enabled, a PIM multicast join received on an interface is processed to join the P2MP LDP LSP, using the in-band signaled P2MP tree for the same multicast flow. LDP P2MP tree is set up towards the multicast source. The route to the multicast node source is looked up from the RTM. The next-hop address for the route to source is set as the root of LDP P2MP tree.",
