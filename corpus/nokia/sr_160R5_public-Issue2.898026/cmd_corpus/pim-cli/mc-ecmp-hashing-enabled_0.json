    "FuncDef": "This command enables hash-based multicast balancing of traffic over ECMP links and causes PIM joins to be distributed over the multiple ECMP paths based on a hash of S and G (and possibly next-hop IP address). When a link in the ECMP set is removed, the multicast flows that were using that link are redistributed over the remaining ECMP links using the same hash algorithm. When a link is added to the ECMP set new joins may be allocated to the new link based on the hash algorithm, but existing multicast flows using the other ECMP links stay on those links until they are pruned.",
