Equivalent action with the block keyword on that SAP/SDP- the attributes associated with the matching ISIDs do not get declared or registered on the SAP/SDP. The matching attributes on the other hand are mapped as static MMRP entries on the SAP/SDP which implicitly instantiates in the data plane as a MFIB entry associated with that SAP/SDP for the related Group BMAC. For the other SAPs/SDPs in the BVPLS with MRP enabled (no shutdown) this means permanent declaration of the matching attributes, same as in the case when the IVPLS instances associated with these ISIDs were locally configured."
