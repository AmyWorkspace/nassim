    "FuncDef": "This command associates a BVPLS SAP with the global Ethernet tunnel object specified by tunnel-id. Only one-to-one mapping between SAP and Ethernet tunnel is supported in the initial implementation. The global eth-tunnel tunnel-id with at least a member port must be configured in advance for the command to be successful. A SAP will be instantiated using the active path components (member port and control-tag) for VPLS forwarding. The last member port in the Ethernet tunnel cannot be deleted if there is a SAP configured on that eth-tunnel. This command is only available in the BVPLS context.",
