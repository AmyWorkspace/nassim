    "FuncDef": "This command configures the interval during which LSPs are sent from the interface.To avoid overwhelming neighbors that have less CPU processing power with LSPs, the pacing interval can be configured to limit how many LSPs are sent during an interval. LSPs may be sent in bursts during the interval up to the configured limit. If a value of 0 is configured, no LSPs are sent from the interface.",
