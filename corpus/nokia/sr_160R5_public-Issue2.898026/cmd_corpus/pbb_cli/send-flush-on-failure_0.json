    "FuncDef": "This command enables sending out flush-all-from-me messages to all LDP peers included in affected VPLS, in the event of physical port failures or \"operationally down\" events of individual SAPs. This feature provides an LDP-based mechanism for recovering a physical link failure in a dual-homed connection to a VPLS service. This method provides an alternative to RSTP solutions where dual homing redundancy and recovery, in the case of link failure, is resolved by RSTP running between a PE router and CE devices. If the endpoint is configured within the VPLS and send-flush-on-failure is enabled, flush-all-from-me messages will be sent out only when all spoke-SDPs associated with the endpoint go down.",
