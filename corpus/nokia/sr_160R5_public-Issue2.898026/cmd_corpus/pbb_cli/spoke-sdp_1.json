If signaling is disabled, the vc-type command can still be used to define the dot1q value expected by the far-end provider equipment. A change of the bindings VC type causes the binding to signal the new VC type to the far end when signaling is enabled. \nVC types are derived according to IETF draft-martini-l2circuit-trans-mpls.

The SDP binding tags egress E-Tree traffic with root and leaf VIDs as appropriate. Root and leaf VIDs are only significant between peering VPLS but the values must be consistent on each end. On ingress a tag SDP binding removes the VID tag on the interface between VPLS in the same E-Tree service.
