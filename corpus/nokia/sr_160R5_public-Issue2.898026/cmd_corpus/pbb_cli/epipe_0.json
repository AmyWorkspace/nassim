An Epipe connects two endpoints defined as Service Access Points (SAPs). Both SAPs may be defined in one or, for the 7750 SR, they may be defined in separate devices connected over the service provider network. When the endpoint SAPs are separated by the service provider network, the far end SAP is generalized into a Service Distribution Point (SDP). This SDP describes a destination and the encapsulation method used to reach it.",
