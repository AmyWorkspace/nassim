    "PageTitle": "profiled-traffic-only",
    "FuncDef": "This command specifies whether only profiled traffic is applicable for this SAP. The profiled traffic refers to single subscriber traffic on a dedicated SAP (in the VLAN-per-subscriber model). When enabled, subscriber queues are instantiated through the QOS policy defined in the sla-profile and the associated SAP queues are deleted. This can increase subscriber scaling by reducing the number of queues instantiated per subscriber (in the VLAN-per-subscriber model). In order for this to be achieved, any configured multi-sub-sap limit must be removed (leaving the default of 1).",
