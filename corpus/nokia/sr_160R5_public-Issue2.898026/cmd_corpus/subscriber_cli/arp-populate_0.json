    "FuncDef": "This command enables populating static and dynamic hosts into the system ARP cache. When enabled, the host s IP address and MAC address are placed in the system ARP cache as a managed entry. Static hosts must be defined on the interface using thehostcommand. Dynamic hosts are enabled on the system through enabling lease-populate in the IP interface DHCP context. In the event that both a static host and a dynamic host share the same IP and MAC address, the system s ARP cache retains the host information until both the static and dynamic information are removed. Both static and dynamic hosts override static ARP entries. Static ARP entries are marked as inactive when they conflict with static or dynamic hosts and is repopulated once all static and dynamic host information for the IP address are removed. Since static ARP entries are not possible when static subscriber hosts are defined or when DHCP lease state table population is enabled,\nconflict between static ARP entries and the arp-populate function is not an issue.",
