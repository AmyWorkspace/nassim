    "FuncDef": "This command assists IP-only static hosts to resolve their default gateway and MAC. By default, the BNG anti-spoof filter drops packets from unknown hosts. The auto-reply features first allow hosts to resolve their default gateway and afterwards allow them to forward traffic. Using the data traffic, the BNG can utilize the data-trigger mechanism to learn the host s MAC and populate the full IP+MAC static host entry.",
