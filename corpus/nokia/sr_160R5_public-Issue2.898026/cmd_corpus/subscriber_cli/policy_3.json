    "FuncDef": "This command associates one or more VRRP policies with the SRRP instance. A VRRP policy is a collection of connectivity and verification tests used to manipulate the in-use priorities of VRRP and SRRP instances. A VRRP policy can test the link state of ports, ping IP hosts, discover the existence of routes in the routing table or the ability to reach Layer 2 hosts. When one or more of these tests fail, the VRRP policy has the option of decrementing or setting an explicit value for the in-use priority of an SRRP instance.",
