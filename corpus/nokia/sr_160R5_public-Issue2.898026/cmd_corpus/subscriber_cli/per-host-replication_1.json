    "FuncDef": "This command enables per-host-replication. In the per-host-replication mode, multicast traffic is replicated per each host within the subscriber irrespective of the fact that some hosts may be subscribed to the same multicast stream. As a result, in case that multiple hosts within the subscriber are registered for the same multicast group, the multicast streams of that group are generated. The destination MAC address of multicast streams is changed to unicast so that each host receives its own copy of the stream. Multicast traffic in the per-host-replication mode can be classified via the existing QoS CLI structure. As such the multicast traffic flows through the subscriber queues. HQoS Adjustment is not needed in this case.",
