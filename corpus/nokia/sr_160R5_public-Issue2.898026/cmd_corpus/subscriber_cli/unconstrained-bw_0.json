    "FuncDef": "This command configures the bandwidth for the interface's multicast CAC policy traffic. When disabled (no unconstrained-bw) there is no checking of bandwidth constraints on the interface level. When enabled and a policy is defined, enforcement is performed. The allocated bandwidth for optional channels should not exceed theunconstrained-bwminus themandatory-bwand the mandatory channels have to stay below the specified value for themandatory-bw. After this interface check, the bundle checks are performed.",
