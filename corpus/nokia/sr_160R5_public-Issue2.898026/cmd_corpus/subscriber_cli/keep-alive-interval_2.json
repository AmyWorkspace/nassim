    "FuncDef": "This command defines the interval between SRRP advertisement messages sent when operating in the master state. The interval is also the basis for setting the master-down timer used to determine when the master is no longer sending. The system uses three times the keep-alive interval to set the timer. Every time an SRRP advertisement is seen that is better than the local priority, the timer is reset. If the timer expires, the SRRP instance assumes that a master does not exist and initiates the attempt to become master.",
