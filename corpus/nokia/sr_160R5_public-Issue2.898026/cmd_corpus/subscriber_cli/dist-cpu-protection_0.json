    "FuncDef": "This command assigns a Distributed CPU Protection (DCP) policy to an MSAP policy. The DCP policy is automatically assigned to MSAPs created with this policy. A non-existent DCP policy can be assigned to anmsap-policybecause an MSAP policy is similar to a template that is applied in the MSAP creation. The DCP policy is validated at the time that the MSAP is created, and the MSAP creation is blocked (and an appropriate log event created) if the DCP policy does not exist.",
