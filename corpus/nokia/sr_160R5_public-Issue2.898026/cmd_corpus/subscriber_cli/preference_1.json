Other peers can be in the Open state waiting to be utilized in case that one of the two active peers fail. Once the primary peer fails, the secondary peer will be used to carry traffic as long as the last transaction on it has succeeded (stickiness). Another peer in the Open state will become secondary. Load balancing between peers is not supported.",
