    "FuncDef": "This command controls the export of retail subnets and prefixes to the wholesale forwarding service. When this attribute is configured, subnets and prefixes configured on the retail subscriber interface are no longer exported to the associated wholesale VPRN and remain private to the retail VPRN. This is useful in a IPoE or PPPoE business service context, as it allows retail services to use overlapping IP address spaces even if those services are associated with the same wholesale service. IPoE and PPPoE sessions are actually terminated in the retail service although their traffic transits on a SAP belonging to the wholesale service.",
