    "FuncDef": "This command configures a host tracking policy. IGMP host tracking is an option in the subscriber profile that allows the factoring in of a subscriber s (multicast) video traffic by reducing the unicast operational egress aggregate rate or the rate of the scheduler specified in the ANCP policy to account for a subscriber s multicast traffic. If no ANCP policy is defined, the egress aggregate rate configured in the subscriber profile is reduced. If an ANCP policy is defined, therate-modifycommand in the policy specifies whether the egress aggregate rate or the rate of the egress policer specified in the policy is to be reduced to account for the subscriber s multicast traffic.",
