Only the two peers with the highest preference in the peer table are considered for use (the primary and secondary). Other peers can be the Open state and merely run keepalives (watchdog-request or answer messages).\t After the primary peer fails, the secondary peer will be used as long as the last transaction on it has succeeded (stickiness). Another peer in the Open state will become secondary. Load balancing between peers is not supported.",
