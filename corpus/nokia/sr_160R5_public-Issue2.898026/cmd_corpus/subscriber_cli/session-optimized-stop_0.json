    "FuncDef": "This command optimizes a RADIUS Accounting Stop message for a PPPoE session termination (specifically for session accounting mode when the host update is enabled). By default when a PPPoE session terminates, the system removes a dual stack host in sequence, one host at a time. Therefore, the system will generate a RADIUS accounting interim for each host termination until only the final host is left. The final host will generate a final accounting stop message. Enabling this command will trigger a single Stop RADIUS accounting message and include information of all hosts without the host updates.",
