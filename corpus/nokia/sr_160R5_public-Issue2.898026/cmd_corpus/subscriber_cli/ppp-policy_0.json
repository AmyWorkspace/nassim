    "FuncDef": "This command references a ppp-policy that defines session parameters (ppp-mtu, authentication options, and so on) during the session initiation phase. Normally, the PPP policy is referenced under the group-interface hierarchy. But with capture SAP is it not known at the session initiation phase to which group-interface the session belongs. This is why, with the capture SAP, the ppp-policy must be referenced directly under the capture SAP. The ppp-policy referenced under thegroup-interfacemust be the same as the ppp-policy referenced under the capture SAP. Otherwise the session will not come up.",
