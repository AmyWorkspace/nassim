A scheduler defines bandwidth controls that limit each child (other schedulers and queues) associated with the scheduler. Scheduler objects are created within the hierarchical tiers of the policy. It is assumed that each scheduler created will have queues or other schedulers defined as child associations. The scheduler can be a child (take bandwidth from a scheduler in a higher tier).",
