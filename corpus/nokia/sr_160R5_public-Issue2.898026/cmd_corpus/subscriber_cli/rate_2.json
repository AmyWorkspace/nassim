    "FuncDef": "This command defines the administrative Peak Information Rate (PIR) and the administrative Committed Information Rate (CIR) parameters for the queue. The PIR defines the maximum rate that the queue can transmit packets through the switch fabric (for SAP ingress queues). Defining a PIR does not necessarily guarantee that the queue can transmit at the intended rate. The actual rate sustained by the queue can be limited by oversubscription factors or available egress bandwidth.",
