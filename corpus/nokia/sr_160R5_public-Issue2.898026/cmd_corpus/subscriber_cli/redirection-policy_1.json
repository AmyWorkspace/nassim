    "FuncDef": "This command applies multicast redirection action to the subscriber. The redirection action along with the redirected interface (and possibly service id) is defined in the referenced policy-name. MLD messages is redirected to an alternate interface if that alternate interface has MLD enabled. The alternate interface does not have to have any multicast groups registered via MLD. Currently all MLD messages are redirected and there is no ability to selectively redirect MLD messages based on match conditions (multicast-group address, source IP address, and so on). Multicast redirection is supported between VPRN services and also between interfaces within the Global Routing Context. Multicast Redirection is not supported between the VPRN services and the Global Routing Table (GRT).",
