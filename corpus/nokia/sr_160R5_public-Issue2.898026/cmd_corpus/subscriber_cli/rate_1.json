    "FuncDef": "This command defines the administrative Peak Information Rate (PIR) and the administrative Committed Information Rate (CIR) parameters for the queue. The PIR defines the maximum rate that the queue can transmit packets out an egress interface (for SAP egress queues). Defining a PIR does not necessarily guarantee that the queue can transmit at the intended rate. The actual rate sustained by the queue can be limited by oversubscription factors or available egress bandwidth.",
