    "FuncDef": "This command prevents MSAPs associated with the specified MSAP policy from being deleted unless a manualclearcommand is issued. If this command is not enabled, an MSAP is deleted when a host creation fails or when a subscriber is no longer associated with the MSAP, for example, when a subscriber ends the session. This feature is useful for an operator who wants to keep historical statistics records on MSAPs. It can also speed up host creation on an MSAP since the MSAP is already created.",
