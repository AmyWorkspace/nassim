    "FuncDef": "It is recommended to only use this command whensession-accountingis used. By default, a dual stack subscriber generates a RADIUS accounting interim message for each new host update (IPv4, IPv6 WAN, and IPv6 PD). This command delays the trigger of a RADIUS accounting start message and allows all hosts to connect first. When the delay timer expires, a single RADIUS accounting start message containing all the host currently connected to the BNG is sent to the server. Subsequent host connections will trigger interim-updates if host-update is enabled on session-accounting. For all other accounting modes, this command will delay the trigger of an accounting start when a host connects.",
