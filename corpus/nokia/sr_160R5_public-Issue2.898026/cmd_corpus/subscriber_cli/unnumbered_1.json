    "FuncDef": "This command can be configured only for subscriber interfaces that do not have an IPv4 address explicitly configured and is therefore operationally in a DOWN state. By configuring this command, the subscriber interface borrows the IPv4 address from the referenced interface (directly or indirectly via IP address) that must be operationally UP and located in the same routing instance as the subscriber interface. This allows the subscriber interface to becomes operationally UP and consequently allow forwarding of the subscriber traffic.",
