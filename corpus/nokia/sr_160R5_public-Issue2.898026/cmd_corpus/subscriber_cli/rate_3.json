    "FuncDef": "This command is used to configure the policer s metering and optional profiling rates. The metering rate is used by the system to configure the policer s PIR leaky bucket s decrement rate while the profiling rate configures the policer s CIR leaky bucket s decrement rate. The decrement function empties the bucket while packets applied to the bucket attempt to fill it based on the each packets size. If the bucket fills faster than how much is decremented per packet, the bucket s depth eventually reaches it's exceed (CIR) or violate (PIR) threshold. Thecbs,mbs, andhigh-prio-onlycommands are used to configure the policer s PIR and CIR thresholds.",

The integer value is multiplied by 1,000 to derive the actual rate in bits-per-second. When max is specified, the maximum policer rate used is equal to the maximum capacity of the card on which the policer is configured.
