A customer site is an anchor point to create an ingress and egress virtual scheduler hierarchy. When a site is created, it must be assigned to a chassis slot or port. When scheduler policies are defined for ingress and egress, the scheduler names contained in each policy are created according to the parameters defined in the policy. Multi-service customer sites exist for the sole purpose of creating a virtual scheduler hierarchy and making it available to queues on multiple Service Access Points (SAPs).",

Any modifications made to an existing site affects all SAPs associated with the site. Changing a scheduler policy association may cause new schedulers to be created and existing policers and queues on the SAPs to no longer be orphaned. Existing schedulers on the site may cease to exist, causing policers and queues relying on that scheduler to be orphaned.
