    "FuncDef": "This command configures the interval between consecutive watchdog messages. On the first timeout of the DWR, the SR OS node will resend the DWR message. The peer is still operational during this time. On the second timeout, the peer will transition into a suspended mode and the peer-failover procedure will be initiated (if the peer-failover is enabled by configuration). In this state the peer is not used for new transactions. At the same time, the cooldown procedure is started which means that it would take three successful DWR/DWA message exchanges to reinstate the peer in a fully operation state.",
