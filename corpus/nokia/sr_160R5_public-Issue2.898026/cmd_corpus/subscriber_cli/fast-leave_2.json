    "PageTitle": "fast-leave",
    "FuncDef": "This command enables fast leave. When fast leave processing is enabled, the router immediately removes a SAP or SDP from the IP multicast group when it detects an MLD leave on that SAP or SDP. Fast leave processing allows the switch to remove a SAP or SDP that sends a leave from the forwarding table without first sending out group-specific queries to the SAP or SDP, and thus speeds up the process of changing channels (zapping).",
