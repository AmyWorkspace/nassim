    "FuncDef": "This command is used to modify the size of each packet handled by the policer by adding or subtracting a number of bytes. The actual packet size is not modified; only the size used to determine the bucket depth impact is changed. Thepacket-byte-offsetcommand is meant to be an arbitrary mechanism the can be used to either add downstream frame encapsulation or remove portions of packet headers. Both the policing metering and profiling throughput is affected by the offset as well as the stats associated with the policer.",
