    "FuncDef": "If configured, circuit-id in DHCPv4 Option82 is used to authenticate DHCPv6. If DHCPv6 is received before DHCPv4, it is dropped. Also, a SLAAC host is created based on DHCPv4 authentication if RADIUS returns IPv6 framed-prefix. The IPv6oE host is deleted if the linked IPv4oE host is deleted due to DHCP release or lease time-out. The linkage between IPv4 and IPv6 is based on SAP and MAC address. The sharing of circuit-id from DHCPv4 for authentication of DHCPv6 (or SLAAC) allows 7750 SR to work around lack of support for LDRA on access nodes.",
