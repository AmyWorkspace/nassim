    "FuncDef": "This command references a pppoe-policy that defines session parameters (ppp-mtu, authentication options, and so on) during the session initiation phase. Normally, the PPPoE policy is referenced under thegroup-interfacehierarchy. But with capture SAP is it not known at the session initiation phase to which group-interface the session belongs. This is why, with the capture SAP, the ppp-policy must be referenced directly under the capture SAP. The pppoe-policy referenced under the group-interface must be the same as the pppoe-policy referenced under the capture SAP. Otherwise the session will not come up.",
