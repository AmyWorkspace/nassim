    "FuncDef": "This command enables the sending of one gratuitous ARP to each SAP and is applicable to PPPoE only deployments in which there are multiple subnets under the subscriber interface. In such case, if the switchover occurs, it is sufficient to send a single Gratuitous ARP on every VLAN to update the Layer 2 forwarding path in the access aggregation network. This single gratuitous ARP will contain the IP address of the first GW address found under the subscriber interface address.",
