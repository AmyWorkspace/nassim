    "FuncDef": "This is a capture SAP level command. This command is important in PPPoE deployments with MSAPs. PPPoE operation requires that the MAC address learned by the client at the very beginning of the session negotiation phase remains unchanged for the lifetime of the session (RFC 2516). This command ensures that the virtual MAC address used during the PPPoE session negotiation phase on the capture SAP is the same virtual MAC address that is used by the SRRP on the group interface on which the session is established. Therefore, it is mandated that the SRRP instance (and implicitly the group-interface) where the session belongs to is known in advance. If the group interface name for the session is returned by the RADIUS, it must be ensured that this group interface is the one on which the tracked SRRP instance is configured. PPPoE sessions on the same capture SAP cannot be shared across multiple group interfaces, but instead they all must belong to a single group interface that\nis known in advance.",
