Exclusive edit-cfg mode can only be entered if the candidate configuration is empty and no user is in edit-cfg mode. Once a user is in exclusive edit-cfg mode no other users/sessions are allowed in edit-cfg mode. The user must either commit or discard the exclusive candidate before leaving exclusive edit-cfg mode. If the CLI session times out while a user is in exclusive edit-cfg mode then the contents of the candidate are discarded. The admin disconnect command can be used to force a user to disconnect (and to clear the contents of the candidate) if they have the candidate locked."
