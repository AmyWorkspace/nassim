    "FuncDef": "This command initiates a configuration rollback revert operation that will return the configuration state of the node to a previously saved checkpoint. The rollback revert minimizes impacts to running services. There are no impacts in areas of configuration that did not change since the checkpoint. Configuration parameters that changed (or items on which changed configuration have dependencies) are first removed (revert to default) and the previous values are then restored (can be briefly service impacting in changed areas).",
