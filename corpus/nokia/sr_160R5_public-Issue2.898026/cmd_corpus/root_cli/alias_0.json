    "FuncDef": "This command enables the substitution of a command line (or part of a command line) by an alias. Use thealiascommand to create alternative or easier to remember/understand names for an entity or command string. If the string contains special characters (#, $, spaces, and so on), the entire string must be enclosed within double quotes. The special characters \"/\" and \"\\\" cannot be used as the first character inside an alias string. An alias can contain a double quote character by preceding the quote with a \"\\\" character (for example,alias my-alias \"| match \\\"string\\\"\"). Only a single command can be present in the command string (the command can be long with many parameters but there is no support for aliases that include multiple CLI commands/lines).
