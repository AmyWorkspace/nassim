    "FuncDef": "This command sets a weighting factor to calculate the new shared buffer average utilization after assigning buffers for a packet entering a queue. To derive the new shared buffer average utilization, the buffer pool takes a portion of the previous shared buffer average and adds it to the inverse portion of the instantaneous shared buffer utilization.",

The value specified for TAF affects the speed at which the shared buffer average utilization tracks the instantaneous shared buffer utilization. A low value weights the new shared buffer average utilization calculation more to the shared buffer instantaneous utilization; zero using it exclusively. A high value weights the new shared buffer average utilization calculation more to the previous shared buffer average utilization value. Values-0 to 15."
