    "FuncDef": "This hold time applies to BRG instances that are created without any hosts; for example, triggered due to proxy authentication. During this initial hold-time the BRG is not deleted and no connectivity-verification is started. When this timer expires, connectivity verification is started. If connectivity verification is disabled and no hosts are associated with the BRG upon expiry, the regular hold time is started and the BRG instance will be removed.",
