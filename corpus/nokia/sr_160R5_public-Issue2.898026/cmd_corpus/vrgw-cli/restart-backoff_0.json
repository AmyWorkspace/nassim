    "FuncDef": "This command configures backoff timer parameters that determine how often and how long the system will attempt to restart a PPPoE client after a failure. When a client first fails, the system immediately tries to re-establish connectivity. If this attempt is also unsuccessful, the system initiates a backoff timer and waits until it expires before attempting to restart the client again, to avoid flooding the BNG. The initial duration of the backoff timer is configured with theinitial-timeparameter. With each subsequent failure, the backoff timer is doubled until the configuredmax-timeis reached.Thenoform of this command reverts to the default.",
