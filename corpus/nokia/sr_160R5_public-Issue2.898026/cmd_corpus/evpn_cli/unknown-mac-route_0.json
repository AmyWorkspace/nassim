    "FuncDef": "This command enables the advertisement of the unknown-mac-route in BGP. This will be coded in an EVPN MAC route where the MAC address is zero and the MAC address length 48. By using this unknown-mac-route advertisement, the user may decide to optionally turn off the advertisement of MAC addresses learned from saps and sdp-bindings, hence reducing the control plane overhead and the size of the FDB tables in the data center. All the receiving NVEs supporting this concept will send any unknown-unicast packet to the owner of the unknown-mac-route, as opposed to flooding the unknown-unicast traffic to all other nodes part of the same VPLS. Although the 7750 SR, 7450 ESS, or 7950 XRS can be configured to generate and advertise the unknown-mac-route, the router will never honor the unknown-mac-route and will flood to the vpls flood list when an unknown-unicast packet arrives to an ingress sap/sdp-binding.",
