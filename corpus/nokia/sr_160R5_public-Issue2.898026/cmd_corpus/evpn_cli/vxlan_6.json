    "FuncDef": "This command displays the VXLAN bindings auto-created in a specified service. A VXLAN binding is composed of the remote VTEP (VXLAN Termination Endpoint) and the corresponding egress VNI (VXLAN Network Identifier) to identify the service at the egress node. The command shows the number of MACs associated to each binding as well as the operational status and if the binding is part of the multicast list. The binding will be operationally down when the VTEP address is not found in the base routing table (the VTEP address cannot be reached). A binding will be part of the multicast list if a valid BGP EVPN inclusive multicast route exists for it.",
