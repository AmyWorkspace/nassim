    "FuncDef": "This command adds a table-size limit per service. By default, the table-size limit is 250; it can be set up to 16k entries per service. A non-configurable implicit high watermark of 95% and low watermark of 90% exists, per service and per system. When those watermarks are reached, a syslog/trap is triggered. When the system/service limit is reached, entries for a specified IP can be replaced (a different MAC can be learned and added) but no new IP entries will be added, regardless of the type (Static, evpn, dynamic). If the user attempts to change thetable-sizevalue to a value that cannot accommodate the number of existing entries, the attempt will fail.",
