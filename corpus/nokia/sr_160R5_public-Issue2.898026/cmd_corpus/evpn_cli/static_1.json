    "FuncDef": "This command configures static entries to be added to the table. A static MAC-IP entry requires the addition of the MAC address to the FDB as either dynamic or CStatic (Conditional Static MAC) in order to become active. Along with the IPv6 and MAC, the entry must also be configured as either host or router. This will determine if the received NS for the entry will be replied with the R flag set to 1 (router) or 0 (host).",
