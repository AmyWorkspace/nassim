The service command can be filtered by VXLAN instance, if the service has more than one instance. A VXLAN binding is composed of the remote (VTEP) and the corresponding egress (VNI) to identify the service at the egress node. The command shows the number of MACs associated to each binding as well as the operational status and if the binding is part of the multicast list. The binding will be operationally down when the VTEP address is not found in the base routing table (the VTEP address cannot be reached). A binding will be part of a multicast list if a valid BGP EVPN inclusive multicast route exists for it.",
