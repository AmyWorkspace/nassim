    "FuncDef": "This command controls the advertisement of Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag (IMET) routes for ingress replication in the case where the PE is Non-DF for a specified network interconnect VXLAN virtual ES. When enabled, the router will advertise IMET-IR routes even if the PE is NDF. This attracts BUM traffic but also speeds up convergence in case of DF failure.",
