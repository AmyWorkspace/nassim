In VPLS services, instance BGP 1 or BGP 2 can be configured, as well as VXLAN instances 1 or 2. Up to two instances of this command can be configured in the same service, as long as the BGP instance and the VXLAN instance are different in both commands. In Epipe services, only BGP instance 1 and VXLAN instance 1 is supported. If the BGP or VXLAN instance are not specified, the instances are by default set to 1.",
