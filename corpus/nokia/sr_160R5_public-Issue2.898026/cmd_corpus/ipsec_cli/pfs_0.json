    "FuncDef": "This command enables perfect forward secrecy on the IPsec tunnel using this policy. PFS provides for a new Diffie-Hellman key exchange each time the SA key is renegotiated. After that SA expires, the key is forgotten and another key is generated (if the SA remains up). This means that an attacker who cracks part of the exchange can only read the part that used the key before the key changed. There is no advantage in cracking the other parts if they attacker has already cracked one.",
