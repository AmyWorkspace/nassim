    "FuncDef": "This command assigns a BFD session to provide a heart-beat mechanism for a given IPsec tunnel. There can be only one BFD session assigned to any given IPsec tunnel, but there can be multiple IPsec tunnels using same BFD session. BFD controls the state of the associated tunnel. If the BFD session goes down, the system will also bring down the associated non-designated IPsec tunnel.",
