Groups held dormant in this manner will neither pass traffic nor negotiate security keys. This interval ends when either the redundant peer is contacted and a master election occurs, or when the maximum duration expires. Values-1 to 1800."

            "Info": "Specifies the maximum duration of an interval immediately following system start up. When the normal discovery interval for a group would expire while the post-boot discovery interval is still active, then the group's discovery interval is extended until the post-boot discovery interval expires. This allows an extension to the normal discovery stage of groups following a chassis reboot, to account for the larger variance in routing. Values-1 to 1800."
