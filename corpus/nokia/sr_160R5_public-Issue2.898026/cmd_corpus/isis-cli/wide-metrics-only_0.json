    "FuncDef": "This command enables the exclusive use of wide metrics in the LSPs for the level number. Narrow metrics can have values between 1 and 63. IS-IS can generate two TLVs, one for the adjacency and one for the IP prefix. In order to support traffic engineering, wider metrics are required. When wide metrics are used, a second pair of TLVs are added, again, one for the adjacency and one for the IP prefix.",
