    "FuncDef": "This command enables strict checking of address families (IPv4 and IPv6) for IS-IS adjacencies. When enabled, adjacencies will not come up unless both routers have exactly the same address families configured. If there is an existing adjacency with unmatched address families, it will be torn down. This command is used to prevent black-holing traffic when IPv4 and IPv6 topologies are different. When disabled (no strict-adjacency-check) a BFD session failure for either IPv4 or Ipv6 will cause the routes for the other address family to be removed as well.",
