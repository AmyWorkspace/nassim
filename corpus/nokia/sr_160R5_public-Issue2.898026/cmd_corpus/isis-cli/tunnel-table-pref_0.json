    "FuncDef": "This command configures the TTM preference of SR tunnels created by the IGP instance. This is used in the case of BGP shortcuts, VPRN auto-bind, or BGP transport tunnel when the new tunnel binding commands are configured to theanyvalue which parses the TTM for tunnels in the protocol preference order. The user can choose to either go with the global TTM preference or list explicitly the tunnel types they want to use. When they list the tunnel types explicitly, the TTM preference will still be used to select one type over the other. In both cases, a fallback to the next preferred tunnel type is performed if the selected one fails. Also, a reversion to a more preferred tunnel type is performed as soon as one is available.",
