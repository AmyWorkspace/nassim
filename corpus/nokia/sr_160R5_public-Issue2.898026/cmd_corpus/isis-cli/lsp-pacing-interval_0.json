    "FuncDef": "This command configures the interval at which LSPs are sent from the interface.To avoid overwhelming neighbors that have less CPU processing power with LSPs, the pacing interval can be configured to limit how many LSPs are sent at the interval. LSPs are sent in bursts at the interval up to the configured limit. If a value of 0 is configured, no LSPs are sent from the interface. The interval applies to all LSPs: LSPs generated by the router, and LSPs received from other routers.",
