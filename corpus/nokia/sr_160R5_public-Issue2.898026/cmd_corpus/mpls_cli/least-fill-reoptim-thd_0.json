    "FuncDef": "This parameter is used in the least-fill path selection method. During a timer-based re-signaling of an LSP path which has the least-fill option enabled, CSPF will first update the least-available bandwidth figure for the current path of this LSP. It then applies the least-fill path selection method to select a new path for this LSP. If the new computed path has the same cost as the current path, it will compare the least-available bandwidth figures of the two paths and if the difference exceeds the user configured optimization threshold, MPLS will generate a trap to indicate that a better least-fill path is available for this LSP. This trap can be used by an external SNMP based device to trigger a manual re-signaling of the LSP path since the timer-based re-signaling will not re-signal the path in this case. MPLS will generate a path update trap at the first MBB event which results in the re-signaling of the LSP path. This should clear the eligibility status of the\npath at the SNMP device.",
