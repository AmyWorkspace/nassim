    "FuncDef": "The secondary path LSP is normally signaled once the primary path LSP fails. Thestandbykeyword ensures that the secondary path LSP is signaled and maintained indefinitely in a hot standby state. Standby paths are selected in preference to non-standby secondary paths. When multiple standby secondary paths exist, then the path-preference is used to determine the order in which the paths are selected. If multiple standby secondary paths have the same, lowest, path-preference value then the system will select the path with the lowest up-time. When the primary path is re-established then the traffic is switched back to the primary path LSP.",
