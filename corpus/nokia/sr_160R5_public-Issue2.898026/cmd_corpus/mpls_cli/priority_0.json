    "FuncDef": "This command enables the soft preemption procedures for this LSP path. The operator enables the soft preemption mechanism on a specific LSP name by explicitly configuring the setup and holding priorities for the primary path at the head-end node. The operator can similarly configure priority values for a secondary path for this LSP name. Different values could be used for the primary and for any of the secondary paths. In the absence of explicit user configuration, the setup priority is internally set to the default value of 7 and the holding priority is set to the default value of 0.",
