    "FuncDef": "This command enables the option to do CSPF calculations until the next loose hop or the final destination of LSP on LSR. On receiving a PATH message on LSR and processing of all local hops in the received ERO, if the next hop is loose, then the LSR node will first do a CSPF calculation until the next loose hop. On successful completion of CSPF calculation, ERO in PATH message is modified to include newly calculated intermediate hops and propagate it forward to the next hop. This allows setting up inter-area LSPs based on ERO expansion method.",
