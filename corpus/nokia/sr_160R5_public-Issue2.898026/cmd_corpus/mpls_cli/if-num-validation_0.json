    "FuncDef": "The if-num-validation command is used to enable or disable validation of the if-num in LSP Trace packet against the locally configured if-num for the interface over which the LSP Trace packet was received at the egress LER. This is because some third-party implementations may not perform interface validation for unnumbered MPLS-TP interfaces and instead set the if-num in the DSMAP TLV to 0. If the value isenable, the node performs the validation of the ingress and egress if-nums received in the LSP echo request messages that ingress on this MPLS-interface. It validates that the message arrives on the interface as identified by the ingress if-num, and is forwarded on the interface as identified by the egress if-num.",
