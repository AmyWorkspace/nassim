    "FuncDef": "This command configures the admin group membership of an interface. The user can apply admin groups to an IES, VPRN, network IP, or MPLS interface. Each single operation of the admin-group command allows a maximum of five groups to be specified at a time. However, a maximum of 32 groups can be added to a given interface through multiple operations. Once an admin group is bound to one or more interface, its value cannot be changed until all bindings are removed. The configured admin-group membership will be applied in all levels/areas the interface is participating in. The same interface cannot have different memberships in different levels/areas. It should be noted that only the admin groups bound to an MPLS interface are advertised in TE link TLVs and sub-TLVs when the traffic-engineering option is enabled in IS-IS or OSPF. The IES and VPRN interfaces do not have their attributes advertised in TE TLVs.",
