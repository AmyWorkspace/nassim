    "FuncDef": "This command enables reliable delivery of RSVP messages over the RSVP interface. When refresh-reduction is enabled on an interface and reliable-delivery is disabled, the router will send a message_id and not set ACK desired in the RSVP messages over the interface. The router does not expect an ACK and but will accept it if received. The node will also accept message ID and reply with an ACK when requested. In this case, if the neighbor set the \"refresh-reduction-capable\" bit in the flags field of the common RSVP header, the node will enter summary refresh for a specific message_id it sent regardless if it received an ACK or not to this message from the neighbor.",
