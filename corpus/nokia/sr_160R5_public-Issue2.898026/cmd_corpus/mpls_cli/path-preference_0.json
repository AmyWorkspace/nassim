    "FuncDef": "This command enables the use of path preference among configured standby secondary paths per LSP. If all standby secondary paths have a default path-preference value then a non-standby secondary path will remain the active path while a standby secondary is available. A standby secondary path configured with the highest priority (for example, the lowest path-preference value) is made the active path when the primary is not in use. If multiple standby secondary paths have the same, lowest, path-preference value then the system will select the path with the lowest up-time. Path preference can only be configured on the standby secondary paths.",
