    "FuncDef": "This command configures the specific threshold levels per node and per interface. Threshold levels are for reserved bandwidth per interface. Thete-threshold-updatecommand is used to enable or disable threshold-based IGP TE updates. Any reserved bandwidth change per interface is compared with all the threshold levels and trigger an IGP TE update if a defined threshold level is crossed in either direction (LSP setup or teardown). Threshold-based updates must be supported with both ISIS and OSPF. A minimum of one and a maximum of 16 threshold levels is supported.",
