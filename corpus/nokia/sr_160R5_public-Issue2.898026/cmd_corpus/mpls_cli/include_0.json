    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the admin groups to be included when an LSP is set up. Up to five groups per operation can be specified, up to 32 maximum. Theincludestatement instructs the CSPF algorithm to pick TE links among the links which belong to one or more of the specified admin groups. A link that does not belong to at least one of the specified admin groups is excluded and thus pruned from the TE database before the CSPF computation. However, a link can still be selected if it belongs to one of the groups in aincludestatement but also belongs to other groups which are not part of anyincludestatement in the LSP or primary/secondary path configuration. In other words, theincludestatements implements the \"include-any\" behavior.",
