    "FuncDef": "This command configures a timer to abort Merge-Point (MP) node procedures for a P2P LSP path. When a value higher than zero is configured for this timer, it will enter into effect anytime this node activates Merge-Point procedures for one or more P2P LSP paths. As soon an ingress interface goes operationally down, the Merge-Point node starts the abort timer. Upon expiry of the timer, MPLS will clean up all P2P LSP paths which ILM is on the failed interface and which have not already received a Path refresh over the bypass LSP.",
