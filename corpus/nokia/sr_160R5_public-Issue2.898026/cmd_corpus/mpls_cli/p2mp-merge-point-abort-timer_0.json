    "FuncDef": "This command specifies a configurable timer to abort Merge-Point (MP) node procedures for an S2L of a P2MP LSP instance. When a value higher than zero is configured for this timer, it will enter into effect anytime this node activates Merge-Point procedures for one or more P2MP LSP S2L paths. As soon an ingress interface goes operationally down, the Merge-Point node starts the abort timer. Upon expiry of the timer, MPLS will clean up all P2MP LSP S2L paths which ILM is on the failed interface and which have not already received a Path refresh over the bypass LSP.",
