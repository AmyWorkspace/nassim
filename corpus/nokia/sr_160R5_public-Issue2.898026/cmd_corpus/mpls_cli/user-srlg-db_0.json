    "FuncDef": "This command enables the use of CSPF by the user SRLG database. When the MPLS module makes a request to CSPF for the computation of an SRLG secondary path, CSPF will query the local SRLG and compute a path after pruning links that are members of the SRLG IDs of the associated primary path. When MPLS makes a request to CSPF for an FRR bypass or detour path to associate with the primary path, CSPF queries the user SRLG database and computes a path after pruning links that are members of the SRLG IDs of the PLR outgoing interface.",
