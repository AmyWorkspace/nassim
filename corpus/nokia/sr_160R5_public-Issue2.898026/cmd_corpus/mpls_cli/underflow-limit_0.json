    "FuncDef": "This command configures underflow-triggered auto-bandwidth adjustment. An underflow auto-bandwidth adjustment can occur any time during the adjust-interval; it is triggered when the number of consecutive underflow samples reaches the threshold N configured as part of this command. The new bandwidth of the LSP after a successful underflow adjustment is the maximum data rate observed in the last N consecutive underflow samples.",
