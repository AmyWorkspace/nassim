The out-link is the outgoing interface on the node that this path will use, and must be specified. If the out-link refers to a numbered IP interface, the user may optionally configure thenext-hopparameter and the system will determine the interface to use to reach the configured next-hop, but will check that the user-entered value for theout-linkcorresponds to the link returned by the system. If they do not correspond, then the path will not come up.",
