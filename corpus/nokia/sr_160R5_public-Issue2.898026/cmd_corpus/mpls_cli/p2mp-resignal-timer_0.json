    "FuncDef": "This command configures the re-signal timer for a P2MP LSP instance. MPLS will request CSPF to re-compute the whole set of S2L paths of a given active P2MP instance each time the P2MP re-signal timer expires. The P2MP re-signal timer is configured separately from the P2P LSP parameter. MPLS performs a global MBB and moves each S2L sub-LSP in the instance into its new path using a new P2MP LSP ID if the global MBB is successful, regardless of the cost of the new S2L path.",
