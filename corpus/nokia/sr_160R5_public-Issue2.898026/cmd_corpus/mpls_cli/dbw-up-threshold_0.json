    "FuncDef": "This command sets the minimum change (in percent of the latest advertised value) above which an increase in MRLB (IS-IS TE sub-TLV 10) or MRB (OSPF TE sub-TLV 7) triggers an IGP-TE update. This configuration only applies to a change in MRLB or MRB caused by dark bandwidth. Other events affecting MRLB/MRB (such as the change of the subscription factor or the loss of link in a LAG over which the RSVP interface is defined) trigger an immediate TE update, regardless of the importance of the impact.",
