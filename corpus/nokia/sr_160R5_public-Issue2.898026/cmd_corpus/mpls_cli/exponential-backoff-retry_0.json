    "FuncDef": "This command enables the use of an exponential back-off timer when re-trying an LSP. When an LSP path establishment attempt fails, the path is put into retry procedures and a new attempt will be performed at the expiry of the user-configurable retry timer (config>router>mpls>lsp>retry-timer). By default, the retry time is constant for every attempt. The exponential back-off timer procedures will double the value of the user configured retry timer value at every failure of the attempt to adjust to the potential network congestion that caused the failure. An LSP establishment fails if no Resv message was received and the Path message retry timer expired or a PathErr message was received before the timer expired.",
