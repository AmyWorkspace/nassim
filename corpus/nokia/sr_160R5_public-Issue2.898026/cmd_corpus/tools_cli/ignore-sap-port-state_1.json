If the Ethernet port SAP is already operational, there is no immediate effect of the command, and the Ignore Port state under the show service id all command will show \"pending\". However, if the interface Ethernet port transitions to a non-operational state, the command then bypasses this port state and executes the remainder of the operational checks, and the flag for the Ignore Port state transitions to \"active\". When this command is in effect, the SAP represents the state of the SAP ignoring the port state."
