    "FuncDef": "This command specifies whether the system will preserve system indexes when asavecommand is executed. During a subsequent boot, the index file is read along with the configuration file. As a result, a number of system indexes are preserved between reboots, including the interface index, LSP IDs, path IDs, etc. This reduces resynchronizations of the Network Management System (NMS) with the affected network element.",
