    "FuncDef": "This command explicitly sets the forwarding class or enqueuing priority and profile of the packet when a packet is marked with adot1p-priorityspecified. Adding a dot1p rule on the policy forces packets that match thedot1p-priorityspecified to override and be assigned to the forwarding class and enqueuing priority and profile of the packet, based on the parameters included in the dot1p rule. When the forwarding class is not specified in the rule, a matching packet preserves (or inherits) the existing forwarding class derived from earlier matches in the classification hierarchy. When the enqueuing priority is not specified in the rule, a matching packet preserves (or inherits) the existing enqueuing priority derived from earlier matches in the classification hierarchy.",
