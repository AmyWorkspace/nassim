    "FuncDef": "This command defines how the multicast ingress path manager determines the amount of bandwidth required by a multicast channel. The default setting is dynamic which causes the bandwidth manager to adjust the path bandwidth based on the current ingress multicast bandwidth. The alternative setting is use-admin-bw which causes the bandwidth manager to use the configured admin-bw associated with the channel. The use-admin-bw setting is enabled once the channels ingress bandwidth reaches the bandwidth-policy admin-bw-threshold value. The bandwidth manager uses the dynamic method until the threshold has been reached. If the ingress bandwidth falls below the threshold, the bandwidth manager reverts back to the dynamic method.",
