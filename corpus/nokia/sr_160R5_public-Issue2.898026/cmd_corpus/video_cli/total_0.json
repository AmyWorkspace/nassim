    "FuncDef": "This command sets the watermark to trigger the SNMP trap if the combined FCC and RET bandwidth or session exceeds the configured percentage. The bandwidth is the available egress bandwidth of the ISA. The SNMP trap is cleared when the consumption is lowered by 10%. For example, if the system resource of the bandwidth available is 10 Gb/s and the watermark is configured to be 90%, the SNMP trap is raised as the bandwidth exceeds 9 Gb/s (90% of 10 Gb/s). The SNMP trap is cleared when the bandwidth drops below 8.1 Gb/s (10% of 9 Gb/s = 0.9 Gb/s, and 9 Gb/s - 0.9 Gb/s = 8.1 Gb/s). The default value of the watermark is set at 90% of the system resources for both bandwidth and session.",
