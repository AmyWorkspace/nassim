    "FuncDef": "This command provides a mechanism to reserve an explicit amount of egress bandwidth, in Mb/s, for RET for all the ISAs within a video group. If the amount of egress bandwidth is less than the reserved amount, FCC requests are discarded and only RET requests processed. The bandwidth is dynamically adjusted per ISA within the video group if an ISA becomes operational/non-operational within the group.",
