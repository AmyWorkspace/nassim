    "FuncDef": "This command is used to create or edit channel bundles within a multicast information policy. Bundles are used for two main purposes. First, bundles are used by the multicast CAC function to group multicast channels into a common bandwidth context. The CAC function limits the ability for downstream nodes to join multicast channels based on the egress interfaces ability to handle the multicast traffic. Bundling allows multicast channels with common preference or application to be managed into a certain percentage of the available bandwidth.",
