    "FuncDef": "This command enables Oversubscribed Multi-Chassis Redundancy (OMCR) model where subscriber hosts are synchronized between the two chassis only in the control plane and are kept there (as part of the Multi-Chassis Synchronization (MCS) state) until the switchover occurs. Link or nodal failure will trigger the switchover at which point the subscriber hosts are being fully instantiated in the control and the forwarding plane. This approach allows oversubscription of the resources in the central standby (or protecting) node that is backing-up a number of other active nodes. The total number of protected subscribers in the OMCR cluster exceeds the forwarding capacity of the protecting node. This is achievable by not fully occupying the resources for the subscriber hosts until the failure occurs.",
