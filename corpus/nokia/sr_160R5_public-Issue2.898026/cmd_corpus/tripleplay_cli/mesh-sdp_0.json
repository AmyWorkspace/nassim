The VC type is a 15 bit-quantity containing a value which represents the type of VC. The actual signaling of the VC type depends on the signaling parameter defined for the SDP. If signaling is disabled, the vc-type command can still be used to define the dot1q value expected by the far-end provider equipment.

The VLAN type must be set to VC VLAN type. The root-leaf-tag parameter indicates this SDP binding is a tag SDP that uses a default VID 1 for root and 2 for leaf. The SDP binding tags egress E-Tree traffic with root and leaf VIDs as appropriate. Root and leaf VIDs are only significant between peering VPLS but the values must be consistent on each end. On ingress a tag SDP binding removes the VID tag on the interface between VPLS in the same E-Tree service. The tag SDP receives root tagged traffic and marks the traffic with a root indication internally. This option is not available on BGP EVPN-enabled E-Tree services."
