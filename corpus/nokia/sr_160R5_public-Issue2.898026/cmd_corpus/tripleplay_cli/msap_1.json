    "FuncDef": "This command provides MSAP-related statistics for the chassis and tracks the number of sticky MSAPs. The statistics include the total number of MSAPs, sticky MSAPs, and idle MSAPs. When a subscriber disconnects from a sticky MSAP, it transitions to an idle MSAP. The idle MSAP transitions back to a sticky MSAP when the subscriber reconnects. A large number of idle MSAPs during peak network hours indicate that an idle MSAP cleanup is required. The total MSAP statistic counts both the total number of traditional MSAPs (non-sticky) and total number of sticky MSAPs. Idle MSAPs are counted towards the total number of sticky MSAPs.",
