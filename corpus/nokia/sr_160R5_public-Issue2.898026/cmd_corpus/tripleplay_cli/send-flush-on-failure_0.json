    "FuncDef": "This command enables sending out \"flush-all-from-ME\" messages to all LDP peers included in affected VPLS, in the event of physical port failures or \"oper-down\" events of individual SAPs. This feature provides an LDP-based mechanism for recovering a physical link failure in a dual-homed connection to a VPLS service. This method provides an alternative to RSTP solutions where dual homing redundancy and recovery, with link failure, is resolved by RSTP running between a PE router and CE devices.",
