    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the number of bits to be considered when performing MAC learning (MAC source) and MAC switching (MAC destination). Specifically, this value identifies how many bits, starting from the beginning of the MAC address are used. For example, if the mask-value of 28 is used, MAC learning only performs a lookup for the first 28 bits of the source MAC address when comparing with existing FDB entries. Then, it installs the first 28 bits in the FDB while zeroing out the last 20 bits of the MAC address. When performing switching in the reverse direction, only the first 28 bits of the destination MAC address are used to perform a FDB lookup to determine the next hop.",
