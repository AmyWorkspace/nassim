It will also affect hashing of the subscribers for non-deterministic NAT if the both types of NAT are configured simultaneously. The hashing will ensure that traffic load is distributed over multiple MS-ISAs in the system. For deterministic LSN44, (32 - n) bits of the source IP address will be considered for hashing, where 2^n= classic-lsn-max-subscriber-limit.",
