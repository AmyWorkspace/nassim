    "FuncDef": "This command configures the maximum rate limit at which syslog messages are sent. Once the rate limit is exceeded, NAT flow logs will be buffered. Overload condition is characterized by exhaustion of this buffer space. This condition can occur due to imposed rate limit or the software speed limit. Once the buffer space is exhausted, new flow creation will be denied, and the teardown of the existing flows will be delayed until the buffer space becomes available.",
