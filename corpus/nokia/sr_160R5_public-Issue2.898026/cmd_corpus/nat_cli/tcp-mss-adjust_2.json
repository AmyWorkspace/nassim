    "FuncDef": "This command enables the TCP maximum segment size (MSS) adjustments in a MAP domain. The TCP SYN and SYN-ACK packets are intercepted in both directions, and if their MSS value is larger than the one configured using this command, the MSS value in the packet is re-written (lowered) to the configured value. The end hosts use the lowest setting of the two hosts. The MSS value does not account for the IP or TCP header length.",
