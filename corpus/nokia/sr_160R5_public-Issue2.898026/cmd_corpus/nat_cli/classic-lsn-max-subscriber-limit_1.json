    "FuncDef": "This command sets the granularity of traffic distribution in the upstream direction across the MS-ISA within the scope of an inside routing context. Traffic distribution mechanism is based on the source IPv4 addresses/prefixes. More granular distribution is based on the IPv4 address, while distribution based on the IPv4 prefix (determined by prefix length) will be less granular. The granularity will further decrease with shorter prefix length.",
