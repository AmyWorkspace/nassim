    "FuncDef": "This command configures the number of active ISAs in active-standby ISA redundancy model for NAT. The active ISAs are automatically selected by the system and any the remaining ISA beyond the number of active limit will automatically assume the standby role. An ISA in the standby mode is idle until the failure of an active ISA occurs. Standby ISA can accept traffic from exactly one failed active ISA. Multiple standby ISAs can be configured in the system to protect against multiple simultaneous failures.",
