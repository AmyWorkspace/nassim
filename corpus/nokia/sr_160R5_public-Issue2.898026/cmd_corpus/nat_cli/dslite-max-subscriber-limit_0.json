    "FuncDef": "This command sets the value for the number of high order bits of the source IPv6 address that will be considered as DS-Lite subscriber. The remaining bits of the source IPv6 address will be masked off, effectively aggregation all IPv6 source addresses under the configured prefix length into a single DS-Lite subscriber. Source IPv4 addresses/ports of the traffic carried within the DS-Lite subscriber will be translated into a single outside IPv4 address and the corresponding deterministic port-block (port-blocks can be extended).",
