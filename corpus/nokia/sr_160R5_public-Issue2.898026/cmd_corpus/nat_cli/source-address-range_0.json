    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the first IP address in the range of IPv4 addresses that are assigned to a BB-ISA in a given NAT group for NAT RADIUS accounting. The IP addresses are unique within the NAT group and are used to bind the RADIUS client instantiated on each BB-ISA card. The number of IPv4 addresses allocated is equal to the number of BB-ISAs in a NAT group that are enabled for NAT RADIUS accounting. Although only the first IPv4 address is explicitly configured with this command, each internally allocated IPv4 address associated with the BB-ISA card can be seen in the routing table (via show commands) as /32 with protocol designation  NAT .",
