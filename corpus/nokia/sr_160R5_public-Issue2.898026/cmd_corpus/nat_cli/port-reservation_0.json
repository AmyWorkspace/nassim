    "FuncDef": "This command is applicable only to deterministic NAT. It configures the number of deterministic ports per subscriber (for example a subscriber is an inside IP address in LSN44 or IPv6 address or prefix in DS-lite). Once this command is enabled, the pool will transition into deterministic mode of operation. This means that the subscribers can use dynamic port-blocks in the pool only as a mean to expand the range of originally assigned deterministic ports. A pool with such property is referred to as deterministic pool. However, deterministic NAT and non-deterministic NAT cannot use the same pool simultaneously.",
