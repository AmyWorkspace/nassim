By default, when this command is disabled, the messages are sent at a high rate determined by the processing capability of the SR OS. Such a high message rate can exceed the processing power of the logging server which can result in the loss of logging information. To overcome this, the Interim Update messages can be generated in a staggered manner at a configured interval that is accommodating toward the processing capabilities of the logging server.
