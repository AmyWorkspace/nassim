Hosts connected to the inside service will be able to ARP for this address. To verify connectivity, a host can also ping the address. This address is typically used as next hop of the default route of a Layer 2-aware host. The given mask defines a Layer 2-aware subnet. The (inside) IP address used by a Layer 2-aware host must match one of the subnets defined here or it will be rejected.",
