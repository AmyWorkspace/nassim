    "FuncDef": "This command suppresses the tmnxNatLsnSubBlksFree summary notification and use the tmnxNatPlBlockAllocationLsn notifications. When the SR OS node is in a state of excessive logging, the queue associated with the transmission of logs on the MS-ISA can become congested. This event further delays the generation of logs, and with this, further allocations and deallocations of NAT resources (port-blocks) will be stalled until the queue is relieved of congestion. For example, an excessive logging state in the system can be caused by issuing a command to clear a large number of NAT subscribers where a large number of resources (port-blocks) are released at once.",
