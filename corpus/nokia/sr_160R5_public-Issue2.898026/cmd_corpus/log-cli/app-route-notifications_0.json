    "FuncDef": "Specific system applications in SR OS can take action based on a route to certain IP destinations being available. This CLI branch contains configuration related to these route availability notifications. A delay can be configured between the time that a route is determined as available in the CPM, and the time that the application is notified of the available route. For example, this delay may be used to increase the chances that other system modules (such as IOMs/XCMs/MDAs/XMAs) are fully programmed with the new route before the application takes action. Currently, the only application that acts upon theseroute availableorroute changednotifications with their configurable delays is the SNMP replay feature, which receives notifications of route availability to the SNMP trap receiver destination IP address.",
