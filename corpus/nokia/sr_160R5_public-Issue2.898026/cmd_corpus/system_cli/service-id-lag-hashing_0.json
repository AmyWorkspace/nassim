    "FuncDef": "This command enables enhanced VLL LAG service ID hashing. This command improves the LAG spraying of VLL service packets and is applied only when both ECMP and LAG hashing are performed by the same router. By default, the ECMP interface and LAG link for all packets on the VLL service are selected based on a direct modulo operation of the service ID. This command enhances distribution and hashes the service ID prior to the LAG link modulo operation when an ECMP link modulo operation is performed.",
