    "FuncDef": "The operator can enable automatic synchronization of rollback checkpoint files between the active CPM and standby CPM. When this automatic synchronization is enabled, a rollback save will cause the new checkpoint file to be saved on both the active and standby CPMs. The suffixes of the old checkpoint files on both active and standby CPMs are incremented. Note that automatic sync only causes the one new checkpoint file to be copied to both CFs (the other 9 checkpoints are not automatically copied from active to standby but that can be done manually withadmin red rollback-sync).",
