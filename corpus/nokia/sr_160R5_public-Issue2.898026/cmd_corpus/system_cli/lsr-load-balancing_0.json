At the expected Ethertype offset location, the algorithm checks whether the value present is IPv4/v6 (0x0800 or 0x86DD). If the check passes, the hash algorithm checks the first nibble at the expected IP header location for IPv4/IPv6 (0x0100/0x0110). If the secondary check passes, the hash is performed using IP SA/DA fields in the expected IP header; if any of the checks fail, the label-stack hash is performed."
