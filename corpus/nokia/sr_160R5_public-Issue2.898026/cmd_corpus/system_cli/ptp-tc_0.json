    "FuncDef": "This command enables the ethernet satellite IEEE1588 transparent clock function. This provides increased accuracy on the PTP event messages transiting the satellite. When a IEEE1588 event message transits the ethernet satellite, the correction field of the message is updated with the residence time of that message. This is used in PTP time calculations. The ethernet satellite shall perform the transparent clock function on PTP messages with Ethernet and UDP/IP encapsulation. All ports of the satellite are enabled for this capability with the one setting. This feature must be enabled to allow the assignment of one of the satellite s client ports as a PTP port underconfig>system>ptp>port. Only PTP using Ethernet encapsulation is supported from the host.",
