    "FuncDef": "This command allows the user to enable a supply of +24V output power on the +24VDC pin of the Alarm Interface Port of the CPM. When enabled, the power supplied through the +24VDC output pin can be used as a source voltage for the alarm contact input pins. The +24VDC output can be used to supply power for monitoring external sensor devices such as cabinet door sensors instead of using an external power source. If users want to use a separate external power source, they should disable the supply of power to the +24VDC output pin by using this CLI command.",
