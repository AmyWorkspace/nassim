    "FuncDef": "This command instructs the system where to write the persistency files for the corresponding application. Each application creates two files on the flash card, one with suffix .i<version>, referencing an index file, and the other with suffix .0<version>, where <version> is a 2-digit number reflecting the file version. These versions are not related to the SROS release running on the node. The <version> can remain the same over two major releases, for example, when no format change is made to the persistency file. On boot, the system scans the file systems looking for the corresponding persistency files, and the load begins.",
