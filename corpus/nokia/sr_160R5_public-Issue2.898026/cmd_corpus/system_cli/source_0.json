    "FuncDef": "This command configures the values used to identify the source of the BITS (Building Integrated Timing Supply) output. This is either the signal recovered directly from ref1, ref2 or ptp, or it is the output of the node s central clock. The directly recovered signal would be used when the BITS output signal is feeding into an external stand alone timing distribution device (BITS/SASE). The specific directly recovered signal used is the best of the available signals based of the QL and/or the ref-order. The central clock output would be used when no BITS/SASE device is present and the BITS output signal is used to monitor the quality of the recovered clock within the system.",
