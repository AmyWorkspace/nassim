    "PageTitle": "src-port",
    "FuncDef": "This command configures a source TCP, UDP, or SCTP port number, port range, or port match list for an IP filter or IP exception match criterion. An entry containing Layer 4 non-zero match criteria will not match non-initial (2nd, 3rd, and so on) fragments of a fragmented packet since only the first fragment contains the Layer 4 information. Similarly an entry containing \"src-port eq0\" match criterion, may match non-initial fragments when the source port value is not present in a packet fragment and other match criteria are also met.",
