    "FuncDef": "This command configures matching on the ICMP/ICMPv6 type field in the ICMP/ICMPv6 header of an IPv4 or IPv6 packet as a filter match criterion or configures matching on the ICMP type field in the ICMP header of an IPv4 packet as an exception filter match criterion. An entry containing Layer 4 non-zero match criteria will not match non-initial (2nd, 3rd, etc.) fragments of a fragmented packet since only the first fragment contains the Layer 4 information. Similarly an entry containing \"icmp-type0\" match criterion, may match non-initial fragments when the Layer 4 header is not present in a packet fragment and other match criteria are also met.",
