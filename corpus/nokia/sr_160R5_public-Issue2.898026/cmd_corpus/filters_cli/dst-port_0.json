    "PageTitle": "dst-port",
    "FuncDef": "This command configures a destination TCP, UDP, or SCTP port number or port range for an IP filter or IP exception match criterion. An entry containing Layer 4 non-zero match criteria will not match non-initial (2nd, 3rd, etc) fragments of a fragmented packet since only the first fragment contains the Layer 4 information. Similarly an entry containing the \"dst-port eq0\" match criterion, may match non-initial fragments when the destination port value is not present in a packet fragment and other match criteria are also met.",
