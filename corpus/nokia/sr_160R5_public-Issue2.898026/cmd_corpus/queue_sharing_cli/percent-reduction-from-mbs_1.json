    "FuncDef": "This command configures the egress queue group queue drop tails as a percentage reduction from the MBS of the queue. For example, if a queue has an MBS of 600 kbytes and the percentage reduction is configured to be 30% for the low drop tail, the low drop tail will be at 420 kbytes. Out-of-profile packets will not be accepted into the queue and will be discarded if the queue depth is greater than this value.",
