If the ID does not exist and is within the allowed range for the QoS policy type, a context for the policer ID will be created (depending on the system's current create keyword requirements, which may require the create keyword to actually add the new policer ID to the QoS policy) and the system enters that new policer s context for possible parameter modification.
