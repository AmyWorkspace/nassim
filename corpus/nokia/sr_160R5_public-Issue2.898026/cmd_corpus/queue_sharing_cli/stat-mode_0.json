    "FuncDef": "This command is used to configure the forwarding plane counters that allow offered, forwarded, and dropped accounting to occur for the policer. An ingress policer has multiple types of offered packets (explicit in-profile, explicit out-of-profile, uncolored, high-priority or low-priority) and each of these offered types is interacting with the policer s metering and profiling functions resulting in colored output packets (green, yellow, and red). Due to the large number of policers, it is not economical to allocate counters in the forwarding plane for all possible offered packet types and output conditions. Many policers, for example, will not be configured with a CIR profiling rate and not all policers will receive explicitly profiled offered packets. Thestat-modecommand allows provisioning of the number of counters each policer requires and how the offered packet types and output conditions should be mapped to the counters.",
