    "FuncDef": "This command enables support for dynamically modifying the MBS size of a queue using HQoS in order to maintain the maximum latency for traffic in the queue based on the queue s configured MBS and the ratio of its operational PIR to its administrative PIR. As the HQoS algorithm updates the operational PIR, by reducing or increasing it, the MBS of the queue is adjusted accordingly.",
