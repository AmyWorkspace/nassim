    "FuncDef": "Thesap-egressQoS policy's policerstat-modecommand is used to configure the forwarding plane counters that allow offered, forwarded, and dropped accounting to occur for the policer. An egress policer has multiple types of offered packets (soft in-profile and out-of-profile from ingress and hard in-profile, out-of-profile, and exceed-profile due to egress profile overrides) and each of these offered types is interacting with the policer s metering and profiling functions resulting in colored output packets (green, yellow, and red). Due to the potential large number of egress policers, it is not economical to allocate counters in the forwarding plane for all possible offered packet types and output conditions. Many policers, for example, will not be configured with a CIR profiling rate and not all policers will receive explicitly reprofiled offered packets. Thestat-modecommand allows provisioning of\nthe number of counters each policer requires and how the offered packet types and output conditions should be mapped to the counters.",
