    "FuncDef": "The access-allocation-weight command is used to define the weight used when dividing access associated buffer space between the named pools. When the named pool is created on an XMA or MDA, the access associated buffer space is summed from all ports. The pool s access allocation weight is divided by the total access allocation weights from all named pools on the XMA or MDA. The resulting factor is multiplied by the summed port access associated buffer space to derive the amount of access buffers applied to the pool. When the named pool is created on a port, the weight is applied against the local ports access associated buffer space to derive the access buffers applied to the pool. A similar process is used with the network-allocation-weight. The total buffers applied to the pool are the sum of the access and network buffers given to the pool.",
