    "FuncDef": "The network-allocation-weight command is used to define the weight used when dividing network associated buffer space between the named pools. When the named pool is created on an XMA or MDA, the network associated buffer space is summed from all ports. The pool s network allocation weight is divided by the total network allocation weights from all named pools on the XMA or MDA. The resulting factor is multiplied by the summed port network associated buffer space to derive the amount of network buffers applied to the pool. When the named pool is created on a port, the weight is applied against the local ports network associated buffer space to derive the network buffers applied to the pool. A similar process is used with the access-allocation-weight. The total buffers applied to the pool are the sum of the access and network buffers given to the pool.",
