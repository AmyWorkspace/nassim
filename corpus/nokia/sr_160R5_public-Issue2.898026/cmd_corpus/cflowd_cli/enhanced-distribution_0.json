    "FuncDef": "This command enables the inclusion of the ingress port ID into the hash algorithm used to distribute cflowd sample traffic to cflowd processes running on the 7950 XRS CPM. By including this new attribute, cflowd may see better distribution of flows across processing tasks if there is a limited number of IP interfaces on which sampling is performed, but those interfaces use LAGs with a large number of port members.",
