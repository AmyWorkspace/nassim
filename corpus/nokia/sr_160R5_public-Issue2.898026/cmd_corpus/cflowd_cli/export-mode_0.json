    "FuncDef": "This command can be used to control how exports are generated by the cflowd process. The default behavior is for flow data to be exported automatically based on the active and inactive time-out values. The alternative mode is manual in which case flow data is only exported when the command \"tools perform cflowd manual-export\" is issued. The only exception is if the cflowd cache overflows, in which case the normal automatic export process is used.",
