    "FuncDef": "This command is used to export flow data using interface indexes (ifIndex values), which can be used directly as the index into the IF-MIB tables for retrieving interface statistics. Specifically, if this command is enabled, the ingressInterface (ID=10) and egressInterface (ID= 14) fields in IP flow templates used to export the flow data to cflowd version 9 and version 10 collectors will be populated with the IF-MIB ifIndex of that interface. In addition, for version 10 templates, two fields are available in the IP flow templates to specify the virtual router ID associated with the ingress and egress interfaces.",
