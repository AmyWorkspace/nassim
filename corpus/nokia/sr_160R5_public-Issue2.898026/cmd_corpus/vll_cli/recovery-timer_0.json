    "FuncDef": "This timer provides the legacy protocols PPP, MLPPP and HDLC time to establish after the Ethernet fault condition has cleared. The legacy protocol is afforded this amount of time to establish the connection before a fault is declared on the legacy side and propagated to the Ethernet segment. This timer is started as a result of a clearing Ethernet failure. Faults that may exist on the legacy side will not be detected until the expiration of this timer. Until the legacy side connection is established or the timer expires the traffic arriving on the Ethernet SAP from a peer will be discarded. The default value is unlikely to be a representative of all operator requirements and must be evaluated on a case by case basis.",
