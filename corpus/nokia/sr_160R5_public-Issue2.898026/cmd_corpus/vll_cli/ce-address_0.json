    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the IP address of the CE device associated with an Ipipe SAP or spoke SDP. In the case of a SAP, it is the address of the CE device directly attached to the SAP. For a spoke SDP, it is the address of the CE device reachable through that spoke SDP (for example, attached to the SAP on the remote node). The address must be a host address (no subnet addresses are accepted) as there must be only one CE device attached to an Ipipe SAP. The CE address specified at one end of an Ipipe will be used in processing ARP messages at the other endpoint, as the router acts as a proxy for ARP messages.",
