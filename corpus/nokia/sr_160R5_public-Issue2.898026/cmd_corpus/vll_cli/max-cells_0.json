    "FuncDef": "This command enables the configuration of the maximum number of ATM cells to accumulate into an MPLS packet. The remote peer will also signal the maximum number of concatenated cells it is willing to accept in an MPLS packet. When the lesser of (the configured value and the signaled value) number of cells is reached, the MPLS packet is queued for transmission onto the pseudowire. It is ensured that the MPLS packet MTU conforms to the configured service MTU.",
