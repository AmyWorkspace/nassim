Unlike the standard QoS policy queue command, this command is not used to actually create or dynamically assign the queue to the object which the policy is applied. The queue identified by queue-id always exists on the SAP or subscriber context whether the command is executed or not. In the case of HSMDA SAPs and subscribers, all eight queues exist at the moment the system allocates an HSMDA queue group to the object (both ingress and egress).",
