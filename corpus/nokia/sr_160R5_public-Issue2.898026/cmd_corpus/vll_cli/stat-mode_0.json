    "FuncDef": "The SAP QoS policy spolicer stat-modecommand is used to configure the forwarding plane counters that allow offered, output, and discard accounting to occur for the policer. A policer has multiple types of offered packets (for example, soft in-profile and out-of-profile from ingress and hard in-profile and out-of-profile due to egress profile overrides) and each of these offered types is interacting with the policers metering and profiling functions resulting in colored output packets (green, yellow, and red). Due to the potentially large number of egress policers, it is not economical to allocate counters in the forwarding plane for all possible offered packet types and output conditions. Many policers will not be configured with a CIR profiling rate and not all policers will receive explicitly re-profiled offered packets. Thestat-modecommand allows provisioning of the number of counters each policer requires and indicates\nhow the offered packet types and output conditions should be mapped to the counters.",
