    "FuncDef": "This command indicates that this spoke SDP is expected to be part of a redundant pseudowire connected to a PBB Epipe service. Enabling this parameter will cause traffic forwarded from this spoke SDP into the B-VPLS domain to use a virtual backbone MAC as its source MAC address when both this, and the control pseudowire, are in the active state on this BEB. This virtual backbone MAC is derived from the SDP source-bmac-lsb configuration.",
