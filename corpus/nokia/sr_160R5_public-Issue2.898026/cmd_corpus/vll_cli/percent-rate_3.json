    "FuncDef": "Thepercent-ratecommand supports a queue s shaping rate and CIR rate as a percentage of the egress port s line rate. When the rates are expressed as a percentage within the template, the actual rate used per instance of the queue group queue-id will vary based on the port speed. For example, when the same template is used to create a queue group on a 1-Gb and a 10-Gb Ethernet port, the queue s rates will be 10 times greater on the 10 Gb port due to the difference in port speeds. This enables the same template to be used on multiple ports without needing to use port based queue overrides to modify a queue s rate to get the same relative performance from the queue.",
