This places an upper bound on the amount of delay introduced by the concatenation process. When this amount of time is reached from when the first ATM cell for this MPLS packet was received, the MPLS packet is queued for transmission onto the pseudowire.",

For example, to bound the delay to 1 ms the user would configure 10 (hundreds of microseconds). The delay-time is rounded up to one of the following values 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400.
