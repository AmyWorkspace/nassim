    "ExtraInfo": "Default: 0 - A value of zero means that when the MC-LAG transitioned the LAG subgroup which hosts the SAP for this VLL endpoint from active to standby, the node sends immediately new T-LDP status bits indicating the new value of standby over the spoke SDPs which are on the mate-endpoint of the VLL. The same applies when any object in the endpoint changes an operational state from up to down."
