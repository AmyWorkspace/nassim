    "FuncDef": "This command is used to associate the PW-port with the PXC ports or PXC based LAGs referenced in the FPE. That is, the PW-port becomes anchored by the PXC. This enables an external PW that is mapped to the anchored PW-port to be seamlessly rerouted between the I/O ports without interruption of service on the PW-port. This mapping between the external PW (spoke SDP) and the PXC based PXC-port is performed via an Epipe operating in vc-switching mode (creation time parameter).",
