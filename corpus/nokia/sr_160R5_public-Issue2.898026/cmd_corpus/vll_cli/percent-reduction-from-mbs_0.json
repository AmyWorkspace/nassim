For example, if a queue has an MBS of 600 kbytes and the percentage reduction is configured to be 30% for the low drop tail, then the low drop tail will be at 420 kbytes. Any out-of-profile packets will not be accepted into the queue if its depth is greater than this value, and so will be discarded.",
