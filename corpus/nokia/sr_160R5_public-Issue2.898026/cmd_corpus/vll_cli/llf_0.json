This feature provides an end-to-end OAM fault notification for Ethernet VLL service and for ATM VLL service of vc-type atm-cell. It brings down the Ethernet port (Ethernet LLF) or sends a SONET/SDH Path AIS (ATM LLF) toward the attached CE when there is a local fault on the Pseudowire or service, or a remote fault on the SAP or pseudowire, signaled with label withdrawal or T-LDP status bits.
