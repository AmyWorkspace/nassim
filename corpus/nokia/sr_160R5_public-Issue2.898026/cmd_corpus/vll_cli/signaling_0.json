    "FuncDef": "This command enables a user to configure this router as the active pr passive T-PE for signaling this MS-PW, or to automatically select whether this T-PE is active or passive based on the prefix. In an active role, this endpoint initiates MS-PW signaling without waiting for a T-LDP label mapping message to arrive from the far end T-PE. In a passive role, it will wait for the initial label mapping message from the far end before sending a label mapping for this end of the PW. In auto mode, if the SAII has the greater prefix value, then the router will initiate MS-PW signaling without waiting for a label mapping message from the far end. However, if the TAII has the greater value prefix, then the router will assume that the far end T-PE will initiate MS-PW signaling and will wait for that label mapping message before responding with a T-LDP label mapping message for the MS-PW in the reverse direction.",
