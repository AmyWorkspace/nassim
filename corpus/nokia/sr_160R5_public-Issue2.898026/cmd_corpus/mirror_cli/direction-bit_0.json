    "FuncDef": "This command is used to steal one bit from the intercept-id in the LI-Shim and use it to indicate the direction of traffic flow for an LI session. Using a direction bit may be used by a LI Mediation Gateway to distinguish between the two directions of traffic flow for an LI session when both directions share a common mirror-dest, intercept-id and session-id. If the direction bit is enabled then the Mirror Header Version (2 bit mhv) in the LI-Shim will be set to binary 01, and the next bit after the mhv is set to 0 for ingress traffic and 1 for egress traffic.",
