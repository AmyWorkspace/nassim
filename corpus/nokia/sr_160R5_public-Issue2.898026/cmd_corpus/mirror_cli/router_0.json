    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the routing instance into which to inject the mirrored packets. The packets are forwarded in the routing instance based on the configurable destination IP address in the inserted IP header. If a mirror-dest is configured to inject into a VPRN service, then that VPRN service cannot be deleted. A mirror-dest with layer-3-encap is set to operationally down if the configured destination IP address is not reachable via an interface in the routing instance or service configured for the mirror-dest. No changes are allowed to the router configuration once a gateway is configured. A service must already exist before it is specified as a router-instance. VPRN and IES services share the same number space for the service-id, but IES services cannot be specified as the router-instance for routable LI encap.",
