    "PageTitle": "file-url",
    "FuncDef": "This command specifies a file URL for the FTP or TFTP server, including the filename for packet capture transfer. After the file URL is entered, the system attempts to establish a connection and creates a file using the filename specified. The command prompt displays an error and rejects the file URL if the session establishment fails, if write privilege to remote server fails, or if the session experiences a sudden termination. If the FTP or TFTP server is unreachable, the command prompt is halted for further input until the retires are timed out after 24 seconds (after four attempts of about six seconds each). This command overwrites any file on the FTP or TFTP server with the same filename.",
