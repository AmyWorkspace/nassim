    "FuncDef": "This command enables and disables the use of one bit from the interception ID field in the LI-Shim header to be used to indicate the direction of mirrored traffic flow for an LI session. An LI Mediation Gateway can use a direction bit to distinguish between the two directions of traffic flow for an LI session when both directions share a common mirror destination, interception ID, and session ID. If the direction bit is enabled, the Mirror Header Version (2-bit MHV) in the LI-Shim header will be set to binary 01, and the next bit after the MHV is set to 0 for ingress traffic and 1 for egress traffic.",
