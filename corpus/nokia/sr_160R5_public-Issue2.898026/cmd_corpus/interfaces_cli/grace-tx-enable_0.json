    "FuncDef": "Enables the sending of grace for all the enabled EFM-OAM sessions on the node. Disabled by default at the system level and enabled by default at the port level. The combination of the system level and port level configuration will determine if the grace function is enabled on the individual ports. Both the system level and the port level must be enabled in order to support grace on a specific port. If either level is disabled, grace is not enabled on those ports. Enabling grace during an active ISSU or soft reset does not invoke the grace function for the active event.",
