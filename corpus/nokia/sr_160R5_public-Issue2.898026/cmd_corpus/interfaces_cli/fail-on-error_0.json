When thefail-on-errorcommand is enabled, and any one (or more) of the specific errors is detected, then the Operational State of the card is set to Failed. This Failed state will persist until the clear card command is issued (reset) or the card is removed and re-inserted (re-seat).   If the condition persists after re-seating the card, then Nokia support should be contacted for further investigation.",
