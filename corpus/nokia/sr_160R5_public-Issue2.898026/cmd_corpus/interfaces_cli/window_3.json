    "FuncDef": "This command defines the size of the window based on a packet receive rate. The minimum serviceable rate is the number of minimum size packets that can be received in one second. The window receive count value will be polled at a minimum one second intervals to see if the window size has been reached. Errors are accumulated until the end of the window. At the end of the window the actual errors are compared to the thresholds to determine if a threshold has been crossed.   There is no mid-window threshold checking. The window represents a unique non-overlapping period of time.",
