    "FuncDef": "This command overrides the system default rate threshold where policers and queues are placed in the \"slow\" queue category. Slow rate policers and queues use a different minimum rate calculation interval time than fast rate queues. The rate is determined based on the previous calculated offered rate for the policer or queue.",

Defining a value of 0 forces all policers and queues to be treated as fast rate. Defining a value of 1000 (1 Mb/s) returns the threshold to the default value and is equivalent to executing no slow-queue-threshold. Values-0 to 1000000 kb/s. ParamDefault: Default- 1000 kb/s"
