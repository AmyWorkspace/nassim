    "FuncDef": "This command configures the policy-based burst tolerance for a parent policer instance created when the policy is applied to a SAP or subscriber context. The system uses the parent policer smin-thresh-separationvalue, the priority level smbs-contributionvalue and the number of child policers currently attached to the priority level to derive the priority level s shared-portion and fair-portion of burst tolerance within the local priority level. The shared-portion and fair-portions for each priority level are then used by the system to calculate each priority level s discard-unfair threshold and discard-all threshold.",

If both bytes and kilobytes are missing, kilobytes is assumed. Setting this value has no effect on parent policer instances where the priority level s mbs-contribution value has been overridden.
