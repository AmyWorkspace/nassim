    "FuncDef": "This command configures WRED slopes within the WRED mega-pool. The WRED slopes in the WRED mega-pool are used when WRED queues are requesting buffers from the mega-pool while they are over their CBS threshold. Once over the CBS threshold, the WRED queue stops receiving buffers from the CBS reserve in the mega-pool and starts competing for buffers in the shared portion of the mega-pool. If the packet resulting in the buffer request is inplus-profile, the packet will be associated with the highplus-slope. In-profile packets are associated with the high slope. Out-of-profile packets are associated with the low slope. Exceed-profile packets are associated with the exceed slope. While the queue is within its CBS threshold, the slopes are ignored.",
