    "FuncDef": "This command defines the number of errored frames within the configured window which indicates the port has gone beyond an acceptable error rate and should be considered degraded. This is a first level warning that a port may be suspect.   An event is raised when the error count is equal to or greater than this value. This is an information log event message only and will be recorded in the Port event index but has no port level actions. This value must be lower than or equal to the sf-threshold value. Specific to symbol errors, this value must be configured with the value that indicates anything less is acceptable and the port can be returned to service. If this value is not configured then manual operation is required to return the port to service.",
