    "FuncDef": "The EAPoL destination MAC address uses a destination multicast MAC address of 01:80:C2:00:00:03. Some networks cannot tunnel this packet over the network and consume these packets, causing the MKA session to fail. This command can change the destination MAC of the EAPoL to the unicast address of the MACsec peer, and as such, the EAPoL and MKA signaling will be unicasted between two peers.",
