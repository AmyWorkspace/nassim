    "FuncDef": "This command specifies that the associated DS-3 is a channelized DS-3 with DS-1/E-1 sub-channels.\nDepending on the MDA type, the DS-3 parameters must be disabled if clear channel is the default (for example, on m12-ds3 MDAs). Clear channel is a channel that uses out-of-band signaling, not in-band signaling, so the channel's entire bit rate is available. Channelization must be explicitly specified. The no form specifies the associated DS-3 is a clear channel circuit and cannot contain sub-channel DS-1s/E-1s. The sub-channels must be deleted first before thenocommand is executed.",
