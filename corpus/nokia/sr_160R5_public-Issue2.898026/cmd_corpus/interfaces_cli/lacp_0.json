    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the LACP mode for aggregated Ethernet interfaces only. This command enables the LACP protocol. Per the IEEE 802.1ax standard, the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) provides a standardized means for exchanging information between Partner Systems on a link to allow their Link Aggregation Control instances to reach agreement on the identity of the Link Aggregation Group to which the link belongs, move the link to that Link Aggregation Group, and enable its transmission and reception functions in an orderly manner.",
