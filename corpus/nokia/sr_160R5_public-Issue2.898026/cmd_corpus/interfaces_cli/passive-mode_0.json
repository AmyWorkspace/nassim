    "FuncDef": "This command configures the passive mode behavior for the MC-EP protocol. When in passive mode the MC-EP pair will be dormant until two of the pseudowires in a MC-EP will be signaled as active by the remote PEs, being assumed that the remote pair is configured with regular MC-EP. As soon as more than one pseudowire is active, dormant MC-EP pair will activate. It will use the regular exchange to select the best pseudowire between the active ones and it will block the Rx and Tx directions of the other pseudowires.",
