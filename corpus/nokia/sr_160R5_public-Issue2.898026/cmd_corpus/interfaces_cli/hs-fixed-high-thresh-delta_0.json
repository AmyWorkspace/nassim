    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the egress aggregate shaper high burst limit threshold delta for this HSQ IOM FP. An aggregate rate can be applied to each egress HSQ queue group, HS secondary shaper and (for subscribers configured with HS SLA expanded mode) primary shaper which manages the maximum burst limit over a specified shaping rate. Each aggregate shaper supports two thresholds which are used in conjunction with thelow-burst-max-classsetting. The system utilizes the lowest value attainable for each low threshold aggregate burst limit without causing shaper underrun conditions. The high burst limit threshold is determined by adding the configuredhs-fixed-high-thresh-deltavalue to the aggregate s low burst limit threshold value. Thehs-fixed-high-thresh-deltavalue should be set to at least two times the maximum frame size to prevent lower threshold class forwarding from also affecting the higher threshold\nclasses when forwarding larger packet sizes. An insufficient high threshold delta defeats the intended purpose of mapping classes to the higher threshold.",
