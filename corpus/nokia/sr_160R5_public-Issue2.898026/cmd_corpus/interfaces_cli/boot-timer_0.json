    "FuncDef": "This command specifies how long the service manager waits after a node reboot before running the MH procedures. The boot-timer value should be configured to allow for the BGP sessions to come up and for the NLRI information to be refreshed/exchanged. The boot-timer is activated after the no shutdown command for a MH site executed from configuration. Upon activation, the boot-timer is compared with the system up-time for the node. If the boot timer is higher than the up-time, then the service manager waits for the boot-timer-sys-up-time, then starts the site-activation-timer.",
