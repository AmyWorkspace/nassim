    "FuncDef": "This command enables multi-class MLPPP as defined by RFC 2686, The Multi-Class Extension to Multi-Link PPP, on a MLPPP bundle (including MLPPP bundle protection groups) with 2, 3 or 4 classes. For multiclass MLPPP bundles with a non-zero count, the class index takes valid values from 0 to one less than the maximum number of classes inclusive. For example a 4-class MLPPP bundle has 4 classes with indexes 0, 1, 2, and 3. A bundle must be shutdown with no links for this value to be changed.",
