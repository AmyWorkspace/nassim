It is expressed as an integer and specifies the shared portion in bytes or kilobytes that is selected by the trailing bytes or kilobytes keywords. If both bytes and kilobytes are missing, kilobytes is the assumed value. Setting this value has no effect on parent policer instances where the min-thresh-separation value has been overridden. Clearing an override on parent policer instance causes this value to be enforced. Values-0 to 16777216."
