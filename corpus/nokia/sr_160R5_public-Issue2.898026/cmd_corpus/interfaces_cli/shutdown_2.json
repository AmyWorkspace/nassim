    "FuncDef": "This command enables or disables egress WRED queue support on the forwarding plane. By default, WRED queue support is disabled (shutdown). While disabled, the various wred-queue-control commands may be executed on the forwarding plane and SAP egress QoS policies and egress queue group templates with wred-queue enabled may be applied to egress SAPs and port, respectively. The forwarding plane will allocate WRED pools to the WRED queues and the appropriate WRED mega-pool size and CBS reserve size will be calculated, but the WRED mega-pool will be empty and all buffers will be allocated to the default mega-pool. Each WRED queue will be mapped to either its appropriate default pool or an explicitly defined named pool.",
