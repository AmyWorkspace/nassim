    "FuncDef": "This command enables generation of the Information OAM PDU off-cycle when the soft reset notification is received by the EFM application. The local port state remains under the control of the Soft Reset application and does not change based on this EFM function. If the port is operationally up then the local node will continue to consider the port as available for service data and forwarding. If the upstream node requires notification to route around the local node undergoing the soft reset, notification must be sent to those nodes. This is a disruptive function.",
