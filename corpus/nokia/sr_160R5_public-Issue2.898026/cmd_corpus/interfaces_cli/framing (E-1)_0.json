In G.704, timeslot 0 is used to carry timing information by a service provider, thus, only 31 slots are made available to the end user. In G.703, all 32 time slots are available to the end user. Timing is provided by the end user. When an e1-unframed channel is shutdown, it sends the AIS pattern to the far-end E-1 which does not react. The operational status remains up and no alarms are generated while the near-end (shutdown) is operationally down. This is normal behavior since the G.703 option does not have framing. G.703 framing is only applicable for FR, PPP, and cHDLC and CEM encapsulations."
