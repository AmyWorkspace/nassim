When in named pool mode, the system will change the way default pools are created and allow for the creation of MDA and port level named buffer pools. When not enabled, the system will create default ingress and egress pools per port. When enabled, the system will not create per port pools, instead a default network and access pool is created for ingress and egress and is shared by queues on all ports.",
