    "FuncDef": "This command enables SONET/SDH payload scrambling. Scrambling randomizes the pattern of 1s and 0s carried in a SONET frame. Rearranging or scrambling the pattern prevents continuous strings of all 1s or all 0s and meets the needs of physical layer protocols that rely on sufficient transitions between 1s and 0s to maintain clocking.",
