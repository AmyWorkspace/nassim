    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the interval, in seconds, used to send periodic keepalive packets. The receiver process expects to receive a keepalive packet every \"keepalive interval\". The link is declared down if the receiver process does not receive a keepalive within the \"timeout interval\". The link is declared up once the number of continual keepalive packets received equals to the up-count. The nodes at the two endpoints of the cHDLC link should be provisioned with the same values. A keepalive value of 0 means no keepalive packets are sent.",
