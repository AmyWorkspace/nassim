    "FuncDef": "This command configures the boot timer interval. This command applies only when the node reboots. It specifies the time the MC-EP protocol keeps trying to establish a connection before assuming a failure of the remote peer. This is different from the keep-alives mechanism which is used just after the peer-peer communication was established. After this time interval passed all the mc-endpoints configured under services will revert to single chassis behavior, activating the best local PW.",
