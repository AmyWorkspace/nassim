    "FuncDef": "This command allows the symbol error event threshold crossing actions to transmit the Event Notification OAM PDU with the specific Link Event TLV information. The Event Notification OAM PDU will only be generated on the initial sf-threshold is reached. No subsequent notification will be sent until the event that triggered the notification clears, through manual intervention or a window where the configured sd-threshold is not reached. The burst parameter under the local-sf-action will determine the number of Event Notification OAM PDUs to generate when the event occurs. The reception of the event notification will be processed regardless of this parameter.",
