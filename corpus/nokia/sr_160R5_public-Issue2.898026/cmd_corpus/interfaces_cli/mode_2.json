    "FuncDef": "This command allows users to configure the dispersion algorithm mode used for the port. Manual mode is used when the user knows the residual dispersion on the link. Automatic mode is used to let the software determine the optimal dispersion compensation required. Automatic mode should be used during service commissioning and when the state if the TDCM control is converged, the user can change to manual mode and configure the dispersion compensation found by the software. Because automatic mode uses a search algorithm that will sweep the entire range of dispersion specified in the sweep command, it can take up to 10 minutes for the link to come up. In manual mode, the link can come up in 2 minutes or less.",
