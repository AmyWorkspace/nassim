    "FuncDef": "This command can be used to override specific attributes of the specified scheduler rate. The rate command defines the maximum bandwidth that the scheduler can offer its child queues or schedulers. The maximum rate is limited to the amount of bandwidth the scheduler can receive from its parent scheduler. If the scheduler has no parent, the maximum rate is assumed to be the amount available to the scheduler. When a parent is associated with the scheduler, the CIR parameter provides the amount of bandwidth to be considered during the parent scheduler's 'within CIR' distribution phase.",
