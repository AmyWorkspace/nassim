    "FuncDef": "This command designates the forwarding plane as a high-bandwidth IP multicast source, expecting the ingress traffic to include high-bandwidth IP multicast traffic. When configured, the system attempts to allocate a dedicated multicast switch fabric plane (MSFP) to the forwarding plane. If a group is specified, all FPs in the group will share the same MSFP. If the alarm parameter is specified and the system cannot allocate a dedicated MSFP to the new group or FP, the FPs will be brought online and generate an event (SYSTEM: 2052 - tmnxChassisHiBwMulticastAlarm). Similarly, if during normal operation there is a failure or removal of resources, an event will be generated if the system cannot maintain separation of MSFPs for the MDAs.",
