    "FuncDef": "This command configures the appropriate flag field in the Information OAM PDU, bursting three consecutive packets during the off cycle. If the local port state is operational, this command changes the local port state to \"Link Up\". If the local port state is not operational, this configuration is installed as an EFM reason to prevent the port from returning to an Up operational state. This command can be used as a precursor to a port shutdown. This terminates the peering relationship without having to wait for protocol timeouts, assuming the peer supports the necessary action when receiving the dying gasp or critical event flag setting.",
