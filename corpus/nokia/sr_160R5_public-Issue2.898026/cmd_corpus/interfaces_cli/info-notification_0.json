    "FuncDef": "The context allows the operator to set different flags in the Information OAM PDU. The flags can be used to notify the peer that a local signal failure threshold has been exceeded within the configured window. This is useful when the local node supports the link monitoring function, but the remote peer does not support this capability. Information OAM PDUs are sent on the interval where the Event Notification OAM PDU is typically only sent on the initial sf-threshold crossing event. It is strongly suggested one of the Information OAM PDU Flag fields used to continually communicate current monitor state to the peer.",
