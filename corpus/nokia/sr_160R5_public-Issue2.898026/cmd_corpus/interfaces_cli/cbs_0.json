    "FuncDef": "This command configures the policer s CIR leaky bucket s exceed threshold. The CIR bucket s exceed threshold represents the committed burst tolerance allowed by the policer. If the policer s forwarding rate is equal to or less than the policer s defined CIR, the CIR bucket depth hovers around the 0 depth with spikes up to the maximum packet size in the offered load. If the forwarding rate increases beyond the profiling rate, the amount of data allowed to be in-profile above the rate is capped by the threshold.",
