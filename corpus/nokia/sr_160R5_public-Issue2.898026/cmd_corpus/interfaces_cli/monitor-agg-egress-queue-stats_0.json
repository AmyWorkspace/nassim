All queues on the port are monitored, including SAP egress, network egress, subscriber egress, and egress queue group queues, as well as system queues that can be used, for example, to send port-related protocol packets (LACP, EFM, and so on). The aggregate in-profile, out-of-profile, and total statistics are provided for both forwarded and dropped packets and octets.",
