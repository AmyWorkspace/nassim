    "FuncDef": "This command enables the context to configure parameters for an Inverse Multiplexing over ATM (IMA) group. An IMA group is a collection of physical links bundled together and assigned to an ATM interface. IMA enables a high-speed channel that is composed of ATM cells to be transported as a number of lower-speed circuits. Then they are reassembled as the original high-speed ATM channel. This command is only valid for IMA bundles.",
