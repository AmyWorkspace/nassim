    "FuncDef": "This command associates a queue for use in a queue group template. The defined queue-id acts as a repository for the default parameters for the queue. The template queue is created on each queue-group object which is created with the queue group template name. Each queue is identified within the template by a queue-id number. The template ensures that all queue groups created with the template s name will have the same queue-ids providing a uniform structure for the forwarding class redirection commands in the SAP egress QoS policies. The parameters within the template queue will be used as the default settings for each queue in the actual queue group. The queue parameters may be individually changed for each queue in each queue group using per queue overrides.",
