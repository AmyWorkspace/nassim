Thehigh-prio-onlycommand is applied to the MBS value to derive the bucket s low priority violate threshold. For ingress, trusted in-profile packets and un-trusted high priority packets use the policer s high priority violate threshold while trusted out-of-profile and un-trusted low priority packets use the policer s low priority violate threshold. At egress, in-profile packets use the policer s high priority violate threshold and out-of-profile packets use the policer s low priority violate threshold.",
