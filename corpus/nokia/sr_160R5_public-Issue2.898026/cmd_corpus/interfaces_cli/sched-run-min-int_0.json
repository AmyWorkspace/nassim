    "FuncDef": "This command overrides the default minimum time that must elapse before a virtual scheduler may redistribute bandwidth based on changes to the offered rates of member policers or queues. A minimum run interval is enforced to allow a minimum amount of \"batching\" queue changes before reacting to the changed rates. This minimum interval is beneficial since the periodic function of determining policer or queue offered rates is performed sequentially and the interval allows a number policer and queue rates to be determined prior to determining the distribution of bandwidth to the policers and queues.",
