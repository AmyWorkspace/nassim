If the port is configured for async-mapping and the payload clock is asynchronous to the OTU clock, there will be positive or negative pointer justification that will show up in the OTU statistics and the data will be received error free. If the port is configured for synchronous mapping and the received data is asynchronously mapped, there will be errors in the received data.",
