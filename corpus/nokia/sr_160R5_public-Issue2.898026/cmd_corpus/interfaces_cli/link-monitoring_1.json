In order to activate Link monitoring function, this context must be configured with the no shutdown option. Shutting down link monitoring will clear all historical link monitoring counters. If the port was removed from service and placed in a non-operational down state and a port state of link up because a signal failure threshold was crossed and link monitoring is shutdown, the port will be returned to service assuming no underlying conditions prevent this return to service.",
