    "FuncDef": "This command configures the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) ITU channel at which a tunable MDA optical interface will be configured to operate. It is expressed in a form that is derived from the laser's operational frequency. For example 193.40 THz corresponds to DWDM ITU channel 34 in the 100 GHz grid and 193.45 THz corresponds to DWDM ITU channel 345 in the 50 GHz grid. Provisioning rules: The provisioned MDA type must have DWDM tunable optics (for example, p1-100g-tun).",
