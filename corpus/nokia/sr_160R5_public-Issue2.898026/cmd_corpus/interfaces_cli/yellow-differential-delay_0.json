    "FuncDef": "This command sets the yellow warning threshold for the differential delay for members within a multilink bundle. If circuit s delay exceeds the yellow-differential delay value, a log message and SNMP trap is sent. This command is only valid for MLPPP bundles. The differential delay is calculated as the round-trip differential delay for MLPPP bundles.",
