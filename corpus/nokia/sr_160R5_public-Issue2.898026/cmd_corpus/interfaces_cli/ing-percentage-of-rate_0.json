    "FuncDef": "This command increases or decreases the active bandwidth associated with the ingress port that affects the amount of ingress buffer space managed by the port. Changing a port s active bandwidth using the ing-percentage-of-rate command is an effective means of artificially lowering the buffers managed by one ingress port and giving them to other ingress ports on the same MDA.",

This does not actually change the bandwidth available on the port in any way. The defined rate-percentage is multiplied by the ingress active bandwidth of the port.
