    "FuncDef": "This command assigns a specific MAC address to an Ethernet port, Link Aggregation Group (LAG), Ethernet tunnel or BCP-enabled port or sub-port. Only one MAC address can be assigned to a port. When multiple mac commands are entered, the last command overwrites the previous command. When the command is issued while the port is operational, IP will issue an ARP, if appropriate, and BPDUs are sent with the new MAC address.",
