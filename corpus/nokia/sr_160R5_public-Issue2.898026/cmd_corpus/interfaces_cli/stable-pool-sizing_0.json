    "FuncDef": "This command provides a stable buffer pool allocation environment for all default port buffer pools on a forwarding plane. This stable environment is provided at the expense of optimal buffer allocation between the various port buffer pools. Normally, port pools are sized according to a ports relative bandwidth with other ports and the ability of a port to use pool buffers. As an example, on a forwarding plane with two potential MDAs and only one equipped, the normal behavior is to provide all available default pool buffers to the ports on the currently equipped MDA. If a second MDA is equipped in the future, buffers are freed from the existing MDA and provided to the ports on the new MDA. Stable pool sizing alters this behavior by reserving buffers for both MDAs whether they are equipped or not thus preventing a resizing event when an MDA is equipped. In addition, existing ports on a module always receive their maximum bandwidth share of buffers independent on any\nsub-rate condition that may currently exist. This provides a stable amount of buffers to other ports on the module independent of link or configuration events that may occur on the port.",
