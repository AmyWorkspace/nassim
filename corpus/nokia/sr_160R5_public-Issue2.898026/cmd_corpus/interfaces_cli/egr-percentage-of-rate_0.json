    "FuncDef": "The egr-percentage-of-rate command increases or decreases the active bandwidth associated with the egress port that affects the amount of egress buffer space managed by the port. Changing a ports active bandwidth using the egr-percentage-of-rate command is an effective means of artificially lowering the buffers managed by one egress port and giving them to other egress ports on the same MDA.",

This does not actually change the bandwidth available on the port in any way. The defined rate-percentage is multiplied by the egress active bandwidth of the port. A value of 150 results in an increase of 50% (1.5 x Rate). Values-1 to 1000. ParamDefault: Default- 100 (no change to active rate)"
