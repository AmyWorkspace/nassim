    "FuncDef": "This command enables the BFD context and enables BFD over LAG links. Additional parameter configuration is required to make BFD over LAG links operational. Normally, BFD session timers are automatically extended during soft-reset operation on the IOMs and IMMs to avoid BFD sessions timing out and causing protocol events. However, in some cases this behavior is not desired as it could delay fast re-route transitions if they are in place. The optional disable-soft-reset-extension keyword allows this behavior to be disabled so that the BFD timers are not automatically extended.",
