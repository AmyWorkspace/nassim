    "FuncDef": "This command configures the forwarding plane counters that allow offered, output and discard accounting to occur for the policer. An ingress policer has multiple types of offered packets (explicit in-profile, explicit out-of-profile, high priority or low priority) and each of these offered types is interacting with the policer s metering and profiling functions resulting in colored output packets (green, yellow and red). Due to the large number of policers, it is not economical to allocate counters in the forwarding plane for all possible offered packet types and output conditions. Many policers will not be configured with a CIR profiling rate and not all policers will receive explicitly profiled offered packets. Thestat-modecommand allows provisioning of the number of counters each policer requires and how the offered packet types and output conditions should be mapped to the counters.",
