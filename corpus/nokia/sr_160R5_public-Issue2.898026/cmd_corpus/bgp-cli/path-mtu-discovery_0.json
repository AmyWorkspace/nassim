    "FuncDef": "This command enables path MTU discovery for the associated TCP connections. In doing so, the MTU for the associated TCP session will be initially set to the egress interface MTU. The DF bit will also be set so that if a router along the path of the TCP connection cannot handle a packet of a particular size without fragmenting, it will send back and ICMP message to set the path MTU for the given session to a lower value that can be forwarded without fragmenting.",
