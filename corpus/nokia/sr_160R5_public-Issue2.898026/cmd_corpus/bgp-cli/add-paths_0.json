The BGP add-paths capability allows the router to send and/or receive multiple paths per prefix to/from a peer. The add-paths command without additional parameters is equivalent to removing Add-Paths support for all address families, which causes sessions that previously negotiated the add-paths capability for one or more address families to go down and come back up without the add-paths capability.",
