    "FuncDef": "This command enables the advertising of inactive BGP routes to other BGP peers. By default, BGP only advertises BGP routes to other BGP peers if a given BGP route is chosen by the route table manager as the most preferred route within the system and is active in the forwarding plane. This command allows system administrators to advertise a BGP route even though it is not the most preferred route within the system for a given destination.",
