The policy controls which IP routes in RTM are eligible to resolve the BGP next-hop addresses of IPv4 and IPv6 routes. The policy has no effect on the resolution of BGP next-hops to MPLS tunnels. If a BGP next-hop of an IPv4 or IPv6 route R is resolved in RTM and the longest matching route for the next-hop address is an IP route N that is rejected by the policy then route R is unresolved; if the route N is accepted by the policy then it becomes the resolving route for R.",
