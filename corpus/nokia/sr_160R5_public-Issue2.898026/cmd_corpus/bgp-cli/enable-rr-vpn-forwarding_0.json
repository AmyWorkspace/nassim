If a received VPN-IP route from IBGP peer X is resolved and selected as best so that it can be re-advertised to an IBGP peer Y, and the BGP next-hop is modified towards peer Y (by using the next-hop-self command in Y s group or neighbor context or by using a next-hop action in an export policy applied to Y) then BGP allocates a new VPRN service label value for the route, signals that new label value to Y and programs the IOM to do the corresponding label swap operation. The supported combinations of X and Y are outlined below:",
