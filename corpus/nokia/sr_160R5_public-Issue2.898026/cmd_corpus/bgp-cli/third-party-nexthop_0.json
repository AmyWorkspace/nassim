    "FuncDef": "Use this command to enable the router to send third-party next-hop to EBGP peers in the same subnet as the source peer, as described in RFC 4271. If enabled when an IPv4 or IPv6 route is received from one EBGP peer and advertised to another EBGP peer in the same IP subnet, the BGP next-hop is left unchanged. Third-party next-hop is not done if the address family of the transport does not match the address family of the route.",
