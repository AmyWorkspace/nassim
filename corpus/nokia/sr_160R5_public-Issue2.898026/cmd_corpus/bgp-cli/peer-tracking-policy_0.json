The policy controls which IP routes in RTM are eligible to indicate reachability of IPv4 and IPv6 BGP neighbor addresses. If the longest matching route in RTM for a BGP neighbor address is an IP route that is rejected by the policy, or it is a BGP route accepted by the policy, or if there is no matching route, the neighbor is considered unreachable and BGP tears down the peering session and holds it in the idle state until a valid route is once again available and accepted by the policy.",
