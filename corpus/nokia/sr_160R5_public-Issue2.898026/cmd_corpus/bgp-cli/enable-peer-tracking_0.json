    "FuncDef": "This command enables BGP peer tracking. BGP peer tracking allows a BGP peer to be dropped immediately if the route used to resolve the BGP peer address is removed from the IP routing table and there is no alternative available. The BGP peer will not wait for the holdtimer to expire; therefore, the BGP re-convergence process is accelerated.",
