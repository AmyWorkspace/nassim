    "PageTitle": "damp-peer-oscillations",
    "FuncDef": "This command controls how long a BGP peer session remains in the idle-state after some type of error causes the session to reset. In the idle state, BGP does not initiate or respond to attempts to establish a new session. Repeated errors that occur a short while after each session reset cause longer and longer hold times in the idle state. This command supports the DampPeerOscillations FSM behavior described in section 8.1 of RFC 4271,A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4).",
