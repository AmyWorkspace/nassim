    "FuncDef": "This command selects RSVP tunneling for next-hop resolution and specifies RSVP tunnels in a tunnel table to IPv4 destinations. This option allows BGP to use the best metric RSVP LSP to the address of the BGP next hop. This address can correspond to the system interface or to another loopback interface of the remote BGP router. In the case of multiple RSVP LSPs with the same lowest metric, BGP selects the LSP with the lowest tunnel ID.",
