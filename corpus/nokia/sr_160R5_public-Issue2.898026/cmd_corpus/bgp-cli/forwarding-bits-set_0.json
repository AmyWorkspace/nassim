When the F bit is set for an AFI/SAFI, it indicates that the advertising router was able to preserve forwarding state for the routes of that AFI/SAFI across the last restart. If a router restarts and does not set F=1, then when the session with a peer re-establishes the peer immediately deletes all LLGR stale routes it was preserving on behalf of the restarting router for the corresponding AFI/SAFI.",
