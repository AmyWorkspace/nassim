    "PageTitle": "backup-path",
    "FuncDef": "This command enables the computation and use of a backup path for IPv4 and/or IPv6 BGP-learned prefixes belonging to the base router. Multiple paths must be received for a prefix in order to take advantage of this feature. When a prefix has a backup path and its primary paths fail, the affected traffic is rapidly diverted to the backup path without waiting for control plane re-convergence to occur. When many prefixes share the same primary paths, and in some cases also the same backup path, the time to failover traffic to the backup path is independent of the number of prefixes.",
