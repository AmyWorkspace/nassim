The segment routing policies that are considered are statically configured in the local router or learned by BGP routes (AFI 1/SAFI 73). For a BGP route to be resolved by an SR policy, the highest numbered color extended community attached to BGP route must match the color of the SR policy. Next hop resolution of VPN IP routes by SR policies is not supported.",
