    "FuncDef": "This command configures HSMDA scheduler policy parameters. HSMDA scheduler policies can be assigned to an egress HSMDA port or as the ingress control scheduler between the HSMDA and the ingress forwarding plane. The policy contains commands to provision the scheduling behavior of a set of HSMDA scheduler classes. When assigned to an HSMDA egress port, the policy defines the scheduling behavior for all queues associated with the egress port. When assigned to the ingress path of an HSMDA, the policy defines the scheduling behavior for all ingress queues on the HSMDA (regardless of ingress port).",
