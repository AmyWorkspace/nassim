    "FuncDef": "This command defines the ending queue depth point for a slope relative to the maximum depth of the queue-mbs value of the HSMDA slope policy. At the point the slope ends, it has risen from the starting queue depth value with a discard probability of zero. At max-depth, the slope will have risen to the discard probability defined by max-depth at which point the slope rises directly to a discard probability of 100%.",
