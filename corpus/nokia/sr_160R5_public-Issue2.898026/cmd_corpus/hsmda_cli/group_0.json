    "FuncDef": "This command defines the maximum rate allowed for the scheduling classes mapped to the specifiedgroup-id. A group is a scheduling entity used to combine up to three consecutive scheduling classes into a single strict priority level. Each scheduling class within the group has an associated weight. When the scheduler is operating at the strict level associated with the group, the ratio of bandwidth allocated to each scheduling class within the group during congestion at that strict level is relative to the ratio of the weight of each member. The bandwidth is allocated in a work-conserving fashion and is sensitive to packet size up to the maximum rate defined for the group.",
