    "FuncDef": "This command defines the buffer allocation weight for a specific root pool. Eight root pools exist and do not need to be created. The allocation-weight parameter is used to specify the weight that will be applied to the pool and is divided by the sum of all root pool weights to derive the pool s buffer allocation factor. The amount of buffers remaining after the system-reserve percentage is applied is multiplied by the buffer allocation factor to derive the pool size.",

The allocation-weight keyword is required and must precede the pool-weight parameter. Setting pool-weight to 0 disables the pool and prevents the root pool from being a parent to any class pools. Root pool 1 cannot be set with an allocation weight of 0."
