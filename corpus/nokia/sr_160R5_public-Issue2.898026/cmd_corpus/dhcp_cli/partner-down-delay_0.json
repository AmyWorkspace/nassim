    "FuncDef": "Since the DHCP lease synchronization failure can be caused by the failure of the intercommunication link (and not necessary the entire node), there is a possibility the redundant DHCP servers become isolated in the network. In other words, they can serve DHCP clients but they cannot synchronize the lease. This can lead to duplicate assignment of IP addresses, since the servers have configured overlapping IP address ranges but they are not aware of each other s leases.",
