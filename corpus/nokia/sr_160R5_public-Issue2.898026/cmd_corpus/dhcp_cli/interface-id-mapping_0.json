    "FuncDef": "If enabled, this command enables the behavior where unique /64 prefix is allocated per interface-id, and all clients having the same interface-id get an address allocated out of this /64 prefix. This is relevant for bridged clients behind the same local-loop (and same SAP), where sharing the same prefix allows communication between bridged clients behind the same local-loop to stay local. For SLAAC based assignment, downstream neighbor-discovery is automatically enabled to resolve the assigned address.",
