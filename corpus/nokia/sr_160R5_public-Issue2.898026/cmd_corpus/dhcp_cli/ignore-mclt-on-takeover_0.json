    "FuncDef": "With this flag enabled, the remote IP address/prefix can be taken over immediately upon entering the PARTNER-DOWN state of the intercommunication link, without having to wait for the Maximum Client Lead Time (MCLT) to expire. By setting this flag, the lease times of the existing DHCP clients, while the intercommunication link is in the PARTNER-DOWN state, will still be reduced to the MCLT over time and all new lease times are set to MCLT. This behavior remains the same as originally intended for MCLT.",
