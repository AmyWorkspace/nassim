    "FuncDef": "This command enables local proxy ARP. When local proxy ARP is enabled on an IP interface, the system responds to all ARP requests for IP addresses belonging to the subnet with its own MAC address, and thus will become the forwarding point for all traffic between hosts in that subnet. When local-proxy-arp is enabled, ICMP redirects on the ports associated with the service are automatically blocked.",
