    "FuncDef": "This command specifies identification strings for the subscriber. This is useful when the server is centralized with Enhanced Subscriber Management (ESM) in a lower level in the network. These strings will be parsed by a downstream Python script or they can be used literally if thestrings-from-optionoption in theconfig>subscr-mgmt>sub-ident-policycontext is set to this option number. In this case, the option number may be set to any allowed number (between 224 and 254 is suggested, as these are not dedicated to specific purposes). If the option number is not given, a default value of 254 is used. For PPPoE only, if the local user database is attached to the PPPoE node under the group interface and not to a local DHCP server, the strings will be used internally so the option number is not used.",
