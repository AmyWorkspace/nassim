    "FuncDef": "This command is used to create, configure, and delete tiered arbiters. Two tiers are supported that always exist, specified as tier 1 and tier 2. Tiered arbiters enable the creation of a bandwidth control hierarchy for managing child policers in an arbitrary fashion. Each arbiter enables parenting of child policers within eight strict levels of priority and a maximum aggregate rate may be defined for the children that the arbiter will enforce. Arbiters created on tier 1 are automatically parented to the root arbiter that is always present. Arbiters created on tier 2 default to the root arbiter as parent, but can also be explicitly parented to a tier 2 arbiter. Child policers associated with an instance of thepolicer-control-policycan be parented to any tiered arbiter or to the root arbiter.",
