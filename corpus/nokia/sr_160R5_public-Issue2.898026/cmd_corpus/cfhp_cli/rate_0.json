    "FuncDef": "This command is used to define the maximum bandwidth an instance of the arbiter can receive from its parent tier 1 arbiter or the root arbiter. The arbiter instance enforces this limit by calculating the bandwidth each of its child policers should receive relative to their offered loads, parenting parameters, and individual rate limits, and using that derived rate as a child PIR decrement rate override. The override will not exceed the child policer s administrative rate limit and the aggregate of all the child PIR decrement rates will not exceed the specified arbiter rate limit.",
