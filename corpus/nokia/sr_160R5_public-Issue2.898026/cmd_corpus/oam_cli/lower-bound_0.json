    "FuncDef": "This command allows the operator specify the individual floors thresholds for the bins. The operator does not have to specific a lower threshold for every bin that was previously defined by the bin-count for the specific type. By default each bin will be the bin-number * 5000 microseconds. Lower thresholds in the previous adjacent bin must be lower than the threshold of the next higher bin threshold. A separate line per bin is required to configured an operator specific threshold. An error will prevent the bin from entering the active state if this is not maintained, at the time the \"no shutdown\" is issued. Bin 0 is the result of the difference between 0 and the configured lower-threshold of bin 1. The highest bin in the bin-count will capture every result above the threshold. Any negative delay metric result will be treated as zero and placed in bin 0.",
