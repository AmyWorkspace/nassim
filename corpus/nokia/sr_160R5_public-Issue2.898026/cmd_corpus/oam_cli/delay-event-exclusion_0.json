    "FuncDef": "This optional command allows results from probes that map to the specified bin and higher bins to be excluded from the TCA count. The TCA count is used to determine if a threshold has been reached by the event monitoring function. Individual counters are incremented in the bin, but the counts in the specified bin and higher bins are not included in the TCA threshold computation. Adelay-eventmust be configured in the same direction, and thelowest-binconfigured as part of thedelay-event-exclusioncommand must be higher than the lowest bin specified by the correspondingdelay-eventcommand.",
