    "FuncDef": "This command sets the threshold to be applied to the overall count of the undetermined unavailability indicators, not transitions, per configured direction. This value is compared to the 32 bit unavailability counter specific to the direction which tracks the number of individual delta-ts that have been recorded as undetermined unavailable. The aggregate is a function of summing forward and backward. This value is only used as a threshold mechanism and is not part of the stored statistics. If the [clearclear-threshold] is not specified the traffic crossing alarm will be stateless. Stateless means the state is not carried forward to other measurement intervals. Each measurement interval is analyzed independently and without regard to any previous window. Each unique event can only be raised once within measurement interval. If the optional clear threshold is specified the traffic crossing alarm uses stateful\nbehavior. Stateful means each unique previous event state is carried forward to following measurement intervals. If a threshold crossing event is raised another will not be raised until a measurement interval completes and the clear threshold has not been exceeded. A clear event will be raised under that condition.",
