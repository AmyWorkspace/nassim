    "FuncDef": "This optional command allows the results from probes that map to the specified bins within the bin type to be excluded from the average calculation. Individual counters are incremented in the bin, but the average is not affected by the value of the excluded delay metric for the individual probes in this bin. The bin group does not allow this command to be added, modified, or deleted when a test is actively referencing the bin group. Sessions that reference the bin group must have the bin group and tests shut down before changes can be made.",
