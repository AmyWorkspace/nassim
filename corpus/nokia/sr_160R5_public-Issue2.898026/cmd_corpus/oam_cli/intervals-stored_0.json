    "FuncDef": "This command defines the number of completed measurement intervals per session to be stored in volatile system memory. The entire block of memory is allocated for the measurement interval when the test is active (no shutdown) to ensure memory is available. The numbers are increasing from 1 to the configured value + 1. The active pm data will be stored in the interval number 1 and older runs are stored, in order, to the upper most number with the oldest rolling off when the number of completed measurement intervals exceeds the configured value+1. As new test measurement intervals complete for the session, the stored intervals will get renumbered to maintain the described order. Care must be taken when setting this value. There must be a balance between completed runs stored in volatile memory and the use of the write-to-flash function of the accounting policy.",
