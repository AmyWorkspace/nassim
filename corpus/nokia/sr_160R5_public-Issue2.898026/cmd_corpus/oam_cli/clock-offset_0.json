    "FuncDef": "This command allows measurement intervals with a boundary-type of clock aligned to be offset from the default time of day clock. The configured offset must be smaller than the size of the measurement interval. As an example, an offset of 120 (seconds) will shift the start times of the measurement intervals by two minutes from their default alignments with respect to the time of day clock.",
