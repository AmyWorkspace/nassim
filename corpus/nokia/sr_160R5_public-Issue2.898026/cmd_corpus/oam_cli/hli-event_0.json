    "FuncDef": "This command sets the high loss interval (HLI) threshold to be monitored and the associated thresholds using the counter of the specified direction. The aggregate is a function of summing forward and backward. This value is only used as a threshold mechanism and is not part of the stored statistics. If the [clearclear-threshold] is not specified the traffic crossing alarm will be stateless. Stateless means the state is not carried forward to other measurement intervals. Each measurement interval is analyzed independently and without regard to any previous window. Each unique event can only be raised once within measurement interval. If the optional clear threshold is specified the traffic crossing alarm uses stateful behavior. Stateful means each unique previous event state is carried forward to following measurement intervals. If a threshold crossing event is raised another will not be raised until a\nmeasurement interval completes and the clear threshold has not been exceeded. A clear event will be raised under that condition.",
