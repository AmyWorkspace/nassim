Adding this functionality will start the monitoring of the configured loss events at the start of the next measurement interval. If the function is removed using thenocommand, all monitoring of configured loss events, logging, and recording of new events for that session will be suspended. Any existing events at the time of the shutdown will be maintained until the active measurement window in which the removal was performed has completed.   The state of this monitoring function can be changed without having to shutdown all the tests in the session.",
