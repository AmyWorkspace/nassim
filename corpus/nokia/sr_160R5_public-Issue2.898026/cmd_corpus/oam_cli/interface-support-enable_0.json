With this command, ETH-AIS on DOWN MEPs will be triggered and cleared based on the operational status of the entity on which it is configured. If CCM is also enabled then transmission of the AIS PDU will be based on either the non-operational state of the entity or on any CCM defect condition. AIS generation will cease if BOTH operational state is UP and CCM has no defect conditions. If the MEP is not CCM enabled then the operational state of the entity is the only consideration assuming this command is present for the MEP.",
