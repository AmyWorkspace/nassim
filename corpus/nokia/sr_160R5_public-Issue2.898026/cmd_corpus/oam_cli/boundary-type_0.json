    "FuncDef": "This command establishes the alignment of the start of the measurement interval with either the time of day clock or the start of the test. Alignment with the time of day clock always defaults to the representative top of the hour. Clock aligned 15-minute measurement intervals will divide the hour into four equal sections 00, 15, 30, 45. Clock aligned 1-hour measurement intervals will start at 00. Clock aligned 1-day measurement intervals will start at midnight. Test relative start times will launch the measurement interval when the individual test enters the active (no shutdown) state. It is typical for the first measurement interval of a clock aligned test to have the suspect flag set to yes because it is unlikely theno shutdownwill exactly correspond to the clock based measurement interval start time. Clock aligned measurement intervals can include an additional offset. See theclock-offsetcommand option under this context.",
