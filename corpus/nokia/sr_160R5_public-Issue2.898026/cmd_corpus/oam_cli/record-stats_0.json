    "FuncDef": "This option provides the ability to determine which statistics are recorded. The TWAMP-Light PDU can report on both delay and loss using a single packet. The operator may choose which statistics they would like to report. Only delay recording is on by default. All other metrics are ignored. In order to change what is being recorded and reported, the TWAMP-Light session must be shutdown. This is required because the single packet approach means the base statistics are shared between the various datasets. Issuing a \"no shutdown\" will clear previous all non-volatile memory for the session and allocate new memory blocks. All the parameters under this context are mutually exclusive.",
