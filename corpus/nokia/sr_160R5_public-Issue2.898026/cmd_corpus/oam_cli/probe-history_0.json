    "FuncDef": "Defines history probe behavior. Defaults are associated with various configured parameters within the SAA test. Auto (keep) is used for test with probe counts of 100 or less, and intervals of 1 second and above. Auto (drop) will only maintain summary information for tests marked as continuous with file functions, probe counts in excess of 100 and intervals of less than 1 second. SAA tests that are not continuous with a write to file will default to Auto (keep). The operator is free to change the default behaviors for each type. Each test that maintains per probe history will consume more system memory. When per probe entries are required the probe history is available at the completion of the test.",
