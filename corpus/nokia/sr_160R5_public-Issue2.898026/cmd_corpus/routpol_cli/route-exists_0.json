If the route existence expression evaluates to  true  the matching and action commands of the policy entry are applied as normal. If the route existence expression evaluates to  false  the entire policy entry is skipped and processing continues with the next entry; however, conditional expressions are only parsed when the route policy is used as a BGP export policy or VRF export policy.",
