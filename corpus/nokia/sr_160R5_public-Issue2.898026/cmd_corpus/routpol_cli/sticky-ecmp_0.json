    "FuncDef": "This command specifies that BGP routes matching an entry or default-action of a route policy should be tagged internally as requiring sticky ECMP behavior. When a BGP route with multiple equal-cost BGP next-hops is programmed for sticky ECMP the failure of one or more of its BGP next-hops causes only the affected traffic flows to be re-distributed to the remaining next-hops; by default (without sticky-ECMP) all flows are potentially affected, even those using a next-hop that did not fail.",
