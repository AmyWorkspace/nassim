    "FuncDef": "This command disables a subscriber RADIUS accounting session from sticking with a single server under normal working conditions. If a direct algorithm is used, all subscriber RADIUS sessions will go directly to the server with the lowest configured index. If a failure occurs, a new in-service server with the next lowest index is used. When the original server recovers, if stickiness is not disabled, all existing sessions will continue to use the new server. This command disables stickiness, and as a result, the recovered original RADIUS server will again service every subscriber. If a round-robin algorithm is used and stickiness is not disabled, an accounting session for a particular subscriber (or host, depending on the accounting mode) will stay with the same server. This command removes the stickiness and all subscriber accounting messages will go through the list of servers in a round-robin manner.",
