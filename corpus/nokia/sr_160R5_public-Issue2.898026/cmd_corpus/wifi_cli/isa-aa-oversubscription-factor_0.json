    "FuncDef": "This command specifies by how much an AA ISA is oversubscribed when linked to a WLAN-GW group. A factor of 1 indicates that each AA ISA is linked to a single WLAN-GW ISA, while a factor of 10 indicates that each AA ISA is linked to up to 10 WLAN-GW ISAs. The factor must be an integer but poses an oversubscription limit, not an exact ratio. For example, for 2 AA ISAs and 5 WLAN-GW ISAs, a factor of 3 or higher is valid. Additional standby ISAs can be added until the oversubscription limit is reached.",
