If it is not configured, an automatically generated Datapath ID is assigned to the switch according to the order in which the OFS instance came up relative to other OFS instances on the node. The configuration should be saved after configuring the OFS ID. If the user originally configures the OFS without an OFS ID, and subsequently adds an OFS ID without saving the new configuration, the OFS may not get the same Datapath ID (which is allocated on a first-come, first-served basis in the absence of an OFS ID).
