Normally, the accounting and leaky bucket functions are based on the 14-byte Ethernet DLC header, 4-byte or 8-byte VLAN tag (optional), 20-byte IP header, IP payload, and the 4-byte CRC (everything except the preamble and inter-frame gap). For example, thepacket-byte-offsetcommand can be used to add the frame encapsulation overhead (20 bytes) to the queue s accounting functions. The accounting functions affected include:",
