In this mode of operation, multiple new sessions can be mapped into the same, newly released tunnel from the blacklist. The first such session will try to setup the tunnel, while the other is buffered until the tunnel establishment process is completed. In case that the tunnel remains unavailable, it is placed in the blacklist again. Consequently all new sessions will have be re-negotiated over an alternate tunnel.."
