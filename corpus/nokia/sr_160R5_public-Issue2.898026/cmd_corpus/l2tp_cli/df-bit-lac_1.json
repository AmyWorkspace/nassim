    "FuncDef": "By default, the LAC df-bit-lac is set to default and sends all L2TP packets with the DF bit set to 1. The DF bit is configurable to allow downstream routers to fragment the L2TP packets. The LAC will not fragment L2TP packets. L2TP packets that have a larger MTU size than what the LAC egress ports allows are dropped. The configuration of the df-bit can be overridden at different levels: l2tp, tunnel, and group. The configuration at the tunnel level overrides the configuration on both the group and l2tp levels. The configuration at the group level overrides the configuration on l2tp.",
