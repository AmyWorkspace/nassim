    "FuncDef": "This command is used to define the number of intervening sample periods before a new offered rate is measured and is only applicable when the policy is applied to a policer. By decreasing the sampling interval, the system will measure a child s new offered rate more frequently. Inversely, increasing the sampling interval causes the child s offered rate to be measured less frequently.",
