    "FuncDef": "This command sets a time period that the current offered rate should be maintained for a child policer or queue when it is seen that the offered rate is decreasing. The offered measurement that triggers the hold time is used when the hold timer expires, unless a higher offered rate is seen in the interim. When a higher rate is observed, the hold timer is canceled and the higher offered rate is used immediately.",

            "Info": "When this optional parameter is specified, the high-rate-hold-time command will accept the optional active-min-only parameter. Attempting to remove the active-min-only parameter from the add command, or removing the add command itself, will fail while active-min-only is enabled on the high-rate-hold-time command. When specified, the respective rate or percentage is treated as the minimum offered rate for a queue, only when the queue has an actual non-zero offered rate. This is intended to limit the artificial increase in offered rate to queues that are currently active. When a queue s measured offered rate drops to zero, the system stops enforcing the minimum value."
