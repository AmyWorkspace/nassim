    "FuncDef": "This command is used to initialize new queues associated with a LUB context to use a minimum PIR similar to the effect of thelimit-pir-zero-draincommand. When a queue is initially created in a LUB context, it defaults to a zero value PIR until HQoS has an opportunity to configure an offered rate based operational PIR. Enabling this command forces a minimum rate operational PIR to be applied to the queue for use by enqueued packets prior to an HQoS iteration.",
