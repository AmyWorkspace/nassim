    "FuncDef": "This command is used to enable queuing of new packets when HQoS determines that a queue should stop forwarding (operational PIR set to zero). The default behavior is to allow the queue to continue to use the previously determined operational PIR and set the queue s MBS (Maximum Burst Size) to zero. This prevents new packets from being admitted to the queue until the PIR zero case terminates. The new behavior whenenqueue-on-pir-zerois enabled is to set the operational PIR to zero and leave the queue s MBS set to the normal value.",
