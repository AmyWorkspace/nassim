    "FuncDef": "This command is used to configure the system to use the minimum configurable PIR instead of an HQoS derived zero operational PIR. The default behavior is to allow the operational PIR of the queue to remain the last configured value while setting the queue MBS to zero (preventing queuing of newly arriving packets). Retaining the previous PIR value may cause a momentary burst above an aggregate rate associated with the queue as it drains. Using thelimit-pir-zero-draincommand causes the queue to drain at the lowest rate possible (typically 1 kb/s) that limits overrun situations.",
