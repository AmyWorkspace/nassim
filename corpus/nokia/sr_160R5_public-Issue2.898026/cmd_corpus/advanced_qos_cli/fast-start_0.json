    "FuncDef": "This command is used to enable fast detection of initial bandwidth on a child policer or queue associated with the policy. Multiple offered rate counter reads may be performed per the sampling interval. The system accumulates these counter values and evaluates the delta at the conclusion of the sampling interval. When fast-start is enabled, the system identifies all children associated with the policy that enter the inactive state (current offered rate is zero). Any inactive  fast start  child that has a positive offered counter during a sampling period bypasses the normal sampling interval and does an immediate offered rate evaluation.",
