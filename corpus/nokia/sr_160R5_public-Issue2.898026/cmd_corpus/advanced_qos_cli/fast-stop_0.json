    "FuncDef": "This command is used to enable fast detection of lack of offered rate on a child policer or queue associated with the policy. Multiple offered rate counter reads may be performed per sampling interval. The system accumulates these counter values and evaluates the delta at the conclusion of the sampling interval. When fast-stop is enabled, the system bypasses the sampling interval for any currently active  fast stop  child that has a zero offered counter measurement and does an immediate offered rate evaluation using the zero value.",
