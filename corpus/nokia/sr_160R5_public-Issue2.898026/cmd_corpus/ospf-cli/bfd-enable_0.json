    "FuncDef": "This command enables the use of bi-directional forwarding (BFD) to control the state of the associated protocol interface. By enabling BFD on a given protocol interface, the state of the protocol interface is tied to the state of the BFD session between the local node and the remote node.   The parameters used for the BFD are set via the BFD command under the IP interface.",

            "Info": "If the BFD session does not come back up within 10 seconds, then OSPF will bring down the adjacency and wait on BFD again. This can cause OSPF neighbors to flap, because OSPF will form the adjacency and then bring it down if the BFD session is still down. If this parameter is not configured, the OSPF adjacency will form even if the BFD adjacency does not come back up after a failure."
