    "FuncDef": "This command configures the TTM preference of shortest path SR tunnels created by the IGP instance. This is used for BGP shortcuts, VPRN auto-bind, or BGP transport tunnel when the tunnel binding commands are configured to theanyvalue, which parses the TTM for tunnels in the protocol preference order. The user can choose to either accept the global TTM preference or explicitly list the tunnel types they want to use. If the user lists the tunnel types explicitly, the TTM preference is still used to select one type over the other. In both cases, a fallback to the next preferred tunnel type is performed if the selected type fails. A reversion to a more preferred tunnel type is performed as soon as one is available.",
