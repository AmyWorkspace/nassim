    "FuncDef": "This command disables the IGP-LDP synchronization feature on all interfaces participating in the OSPF routing protocol. When this command is executed, IGP immediately advertises the actual value of the link cost for all interfaces which have the IGP-LDP synchronization enabled if the currently advertised cost is different. It will then disable IGP-LDP synchronization for all interfaces. This command does not delete the interface configuration. Thenoform of this command has to be entered to re-enable IGP-LDP synchronization for this routing protocol.",
