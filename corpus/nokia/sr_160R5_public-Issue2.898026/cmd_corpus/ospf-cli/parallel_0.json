    "FuncDef": "This command indicates that all members of the adjacency set must terminate on the same neighboring node. The system raises a trap if a user attempts to add an adjacency terminating on a neighboring node that differs from the existing members of the adjacency set. In addition, the system stops advertising the adjacency set in IS-IS or OSPF and locally deprograms it.",
