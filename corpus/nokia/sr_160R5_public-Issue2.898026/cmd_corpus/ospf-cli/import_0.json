When a prefix received in an OSPF LSA is accepted by an entry in an OSPF import policy, it is installed in the routing table if it is the most preferred route to the destination. When a prefix received in an OSPF LSA is rejected by an entry in an OSPF import policy, it is not installed in the routing table, even if it has the lowest preference value among all the routes to that destination. The flooding of LSAs is unaffected by OSPF import policy actions. Thenoform of the command removes all policies from the configuration.",
