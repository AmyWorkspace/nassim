It is over these sessions that the router learns dynamic VRP entries expressing valid origin AS and prefix associations. SR OS supports the RPKI-Router protocol over TCP/IPv4 or TCP/IPv6 transport. The router can set up an RPKI-Router session using the base routing table (in-band) or the management router (out-of-band).
