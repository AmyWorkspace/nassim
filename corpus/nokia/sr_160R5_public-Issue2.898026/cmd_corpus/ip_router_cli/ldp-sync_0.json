    "FuncDef": "This command extends the LDP synchronization feature to a static route. When an interface comes back up, it is possible that a preferred static route using the interface as next-hop for a given prefix is enabled before the LDP adjacency to the peer LSR comes up on this interface. In this case, traffic on an SDP that uses the static route for the far-end address would be black-holed until the LDP session comes up and the FECs exchanged.",
