    "FuncDef": "This command configures the L2TP session limit for the router. L2TP is connection-oriented. The L2TP Network Server (LNS) and LAC maintain state for each call that is initiated or answered by an LAC. An L2TP session is created between the LAC and LNS when an end-to-end PPP connection is established between a remote system and the LNS. Datagrams related to the PPP connection are sent over the tunnel between the LAC and LNS. There is a one to one relationship between established L2TP sessions and their associated calls.",
