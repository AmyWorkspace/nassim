In this mode of operation, multiple new sessions can be mapped into the same, newly-released tunnel from the blacklist. The first such session will try to set up the tunnel, while the other will be buffered until the tunnel establishment process is completed. If the tunnel remains unavailable, it will be placed in the blacklist again. Consequently, all new sessions will have be renegotiated over an alternate tunnel.."
