    "FuncDef": "The sr-te value instructs the code to search for the set of lowest metric SR-TE LSPs to the address of the indirect next-hop. The LSP metric is provided by MPLS in the tunnel table. The static route treats a set of SR-TE LSPs with the same lowest metric as an ECMP set. The user has the option of configuring a list of SR-TE LSP names to be used exclusively instead of searching in the tunnel table. In that case, all LSPs must have the same LSP metric in order for the static route to use them as an ECMP set. Otherwise, only the LSPs with the lowest common metric value are selected.",
