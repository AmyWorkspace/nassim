    "FuncDef": "This command configures OSPF, OSPFv3 and IS-IS to set overload when the router has fewer than the full set of SFMs functioning, which reduces forwarding capacity. Setting overload enables a router to still participate in exchanging routing information, but routes all traffic away from it.",
