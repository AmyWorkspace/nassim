    "FuncDef": "This command configures the AARP mode of operation with the peer instance. The modes affect the AARP state machine behavior according to the desired behavior. Minimize-switchover will change AARP state based on Master ISA failure, and be non-revertive in that when the priority ISA returns a switch does not occur, which is optimal for AA flow identification. Inter-chassis efficiency mode considers both priority (revertive) and the endpoint status of the AARP instance and will switch activity in case of EP failure in order to avoid sending all the traffic over the ICL. The priority-based-balance mode will be revertive after a priority master returns to service, but excludes EP status. The master-selection-mode configuration must match on both peer AARP instances, or the AARP operational status will stay down.",
