    "FuncDef": "This command configures the captive redirect capability for an HTTP redirect policy. HTTP redirect policies using captive redirect can be used in conjunction with a session filter policy and will terminate TCP flows in the ISA-AA card before reaching the Internet to redirect subscribers to the predefined redirect URL. Non-HTTP TCP flows are TCP reset. Captive redirect uses the provisioned VLAN id to send the HTTP response to subscribers; therefore this VLAN id must be properly assigned in the same VPN as the subscriber. The operator can select the URL arguments to include in the redirect URL using either a specific template id or by configuring the redirect URL using one of the supported macro substitution keywords.",
