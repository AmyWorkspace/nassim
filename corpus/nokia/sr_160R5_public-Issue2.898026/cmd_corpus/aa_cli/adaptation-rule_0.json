    "FuncDef": "This command defines the method used by the system to derive the operational CIR and PIR settings when the queue is provisioned in hardware. For the CIR and PIR parameters individually, the system attempts to find the best operational rate depending on the defined option. To change the CIR adaptation rule only, the current PIR rule must be part of the command executed.",
