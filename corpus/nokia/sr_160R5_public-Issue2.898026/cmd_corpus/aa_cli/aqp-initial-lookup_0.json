    "FuncDef": "This command allows AA to perform AQP lookups on flows prior to complete application identification. As usual, AQP will be looked up again on identification complete. Without this, AA executes AQPs that are part of what so called \"sub-default policy\". Sub-default policy is formed by regular AQPs that contain ASOs, subID and/or flow direction as matching conditions.",
