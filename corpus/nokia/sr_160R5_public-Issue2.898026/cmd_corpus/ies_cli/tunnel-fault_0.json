    "PageTitle": "tunnel-fault",
    "FuncDef": "Allows the individual service SAPs to react to changes in the tunnel MEP state. When tunnel-fault accept is configured at the service level, the SAP will react according to the service type, Epipe will set the operational flag and VPLS, IES and VPRN SAP operational state will become down on failure or up on clear. This command triggers the OAM mapping functions to mate SAPs and bindings in an Epipe service as well as setting the operational flag. If AIS generation is the requirement for the Epipe services this command is not required. See theais-enablecommand in theepipe>sap>eth-cfmcontext for more information. This works in conjunction with the tunnel-fault accept on the individual SAPs. Both must be set to accept to react to the tunnel MEP state. By default the service level command isignoreand the sap level command isaccept. This means simply changing the service level command toacceptenables\nthe feature for all SAPs. This is not required for Epipe services that only wish to generate AIS on failure.",
