    "FuncDef": "This command defines the levels of the ETH-CFM PDUs that will silently be discarded on ingress into the SAP or SDP Binding from the wire. All ETH-CFM PDUs inbound to the SAP or SDP binding will be dropped that match the configured levels without regard for any other ETH-CFM criteria. No statistical information or drop count will be available for any ETH-PDU that is silently discarded by this option. The operator must configure a complete contiguous list of md-levels up to the highest level that will be dropped. The command must be retyped in complete form to modify a previous configuration, if the operator does not want to delete it first.",
