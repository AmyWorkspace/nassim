    "FuncDef": "This command disables duplicate address detection (DAD) on a per-interface basis. This prevents the router from performing a DAD check on the interface. All IPv6 addresses of an interface with DAD disabled, immediately enter a preferred state, without checking for uniqueness on the interface. This is useful for interfaces which enter a looped state during troubleshooting and operationally disable themselves when the loop is detected, requiring manual intervention to clear the DAD violation.",
