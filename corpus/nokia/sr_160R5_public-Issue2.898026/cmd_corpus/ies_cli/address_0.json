An IP address must be assigned to each IES IP interface. An IP address and a mask are used together to create a local IP prefix. The defined IP prefix must be unique within the context of the routing instance. It cannot overlap with other existing IP prefixes defined as local subnets on other IP interfaces in the same routing context within the router.",
