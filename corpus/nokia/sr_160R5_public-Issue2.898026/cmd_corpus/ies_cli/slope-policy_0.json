    "FuncDef": "This command assigns an HSMDA slope policy to the SAP. The policy may be assigned to an ingress or egress HSMDA queue. The policy contains the Maximum Buffer Size (MBS) that will be applied to the queue and the high and low priority RED slope definitions. The function of the MBS and RED slopes is to provide congestion control for an HSMDA queue. The MBS parameter defines the maximum depth a queue may reach when accepting packets. The low and high priority RED slopes provides for random early detection of congestion and slope based discards based on queue depth.",
