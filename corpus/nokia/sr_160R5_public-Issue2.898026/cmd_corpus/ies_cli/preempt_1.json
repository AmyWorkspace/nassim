    "FuncDef": "The preempt command provides the ability of overriding an existing non-owner master to the virtual router instance. Enabling preempt mode is almost required for proper operation of the base-priority and vrrp-policy-id definitions on the virtual router instance. If the virtual router cannot preempt an existing non-owner master, the effect of the dynamic changing of the in-use priority is greatly diminished.",
