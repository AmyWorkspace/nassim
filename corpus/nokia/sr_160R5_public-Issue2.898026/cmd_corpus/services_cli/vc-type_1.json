    "FuncDef": "This command sets the forwarding mode for the pseudowire port. The vc-type is signaled to the peer, and must be configured consistently on both ends of the pseudowire. vc-type VLAN is only configurable with dot1q encapsulation on the pseudowire port. The tag with vc-type vlan only has significance for transport, and is not used for service delineation or ESM. The top (provider tag) is stripped while forwarding out of the pseudowire, and a configured vlan-tag (for vc-type vlan) is inserted when forwarding into the pseudowire. With vc-type ether, the tags if present (max 2), are transparently preserved when forwarding in our out of the pseudowire.",
