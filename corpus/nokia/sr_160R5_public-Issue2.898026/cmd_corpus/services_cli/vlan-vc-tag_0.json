When signaling is enabled between the near and far end, the configured dot1q tag can be overridden by a received TLV specifying the dot1q value expected by the far end. This signaled value must be stored as the remote signaled dot1q value for the binding. The provisioned local dot1q tag must be stored as the administrative dot1q value for the binding.",
