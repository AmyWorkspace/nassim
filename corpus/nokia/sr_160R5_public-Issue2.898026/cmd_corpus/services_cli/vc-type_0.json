The actual signaling of the VC type depends on the signaling parameter defined for the SDP. If signaling is disabled, thevc-typecommand can still be used to define the dot1q value expected by the far-end provider equipment. A change of the bindings VC type causes the binding to signal the new VC type to the far end when signaling is enabled. \nVC types are derived according to IETFdraft-martini-l2circuit-trans-mpls.",
