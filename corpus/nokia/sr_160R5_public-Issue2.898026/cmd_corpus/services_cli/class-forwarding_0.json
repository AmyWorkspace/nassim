Specifically, the packet is forwarded on the RSVP LSP or static LSP whose forwarding class matches that of the packet. The user maps the system forwarding classes to LSPs using theconfig>service>sdp>class-forwarding>fccommand. If there is no LSP that matches the packet s forwarding class, the default LSP is used. If the packet is a VPLS multicast/broadcast packet and the user did not explicitly specify the LSP to use under theconfig>service>sdp>class-forwarding>multicast-lspcontext, then the default LSP is used.",

The default LSP is used to forward packets when there is no available LSP which matches the packet s forwarding class. This could be because the LSP associated with the packet s forwarding class is down, or that the user did not configure a mapping of the packet s forwarding class to an LSP using the config>service>sdp>class-forwarding>fc command. The default LSP is also used to forward VPLS service multicast/broadcast packets in the absence of a user configuration indicating an explicit association to one of the SDP LSPs."
