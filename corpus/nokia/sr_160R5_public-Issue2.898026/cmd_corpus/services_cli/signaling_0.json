    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the signaling protocol used to obtain the ingress and egress pseudowire labels in frames transmitted and received on the SDP. When signaling isoffthen labels are manually configured when the SDP is bound to a service. The signaling value can only be changed while the administrative status of the SDP is down. Additionally, the signaling can only be changed on an SDP if that SDP is not in use by BGP-AD or BGP-VPLS. BGP signaling can only be enabled if that SDP does not already have pseudowires signaled over it. Also, BGP signaling is not supported with mixed mode LSP SDPs.",
