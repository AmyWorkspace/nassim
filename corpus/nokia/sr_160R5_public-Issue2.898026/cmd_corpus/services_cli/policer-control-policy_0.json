    "FuncDef": "This command, within the QoS CLI node, is used to create, delete or modify policer control policies. A policer control policy is very similar to the scheduler-policy which is used to manage a set of queues by defining a hierarchy of virtual schedulers and specifying how the virtual schedulers interact to provide an aggregate SLA. In a similar fashion, the policer-control-policy controls the aggregate bandwidth available to a set of child policers. Once created, the policy can be applied to ingress or egress SAPs.",
