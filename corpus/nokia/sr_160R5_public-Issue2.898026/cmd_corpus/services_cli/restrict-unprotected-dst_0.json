    "FuncDef": "This command indicates how the system will forward packets destined to an unprotected MAC address, either manually added using the mac-protect command or automatically added using the auto-learn-mac-protect command. While enabled all packets entering the configured SAP or SAPs within a split-horizon-group (but not spoke or mesh-SDPs) will be verified to contain a protected destination MAC address. If the packet is found to contain a non-protected destination MAC, it will be discarded. Detecting a non-protected destination MAC on the SAP will not cause the SAP to be placed in the operationally down state. No alarms are generated.",
