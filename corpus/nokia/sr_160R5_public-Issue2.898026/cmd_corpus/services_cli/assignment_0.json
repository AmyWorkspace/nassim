This allows the system to allocate the resources necessary to create the virtual schedulers defined in the ingress and egress scheduler policies as they are specified. This also verifies that each SAP assigned to the site exists within the context of the proper customer ID and that the SAP was configured on the proper slot, port, or channel.
