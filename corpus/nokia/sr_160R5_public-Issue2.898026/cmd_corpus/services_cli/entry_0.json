The implementation exits the policy on the first match found and executes the actions in accordance with the accompanying action command. For this reason, entries must be sequenced correctly from most to least explicit. An entry may not have any match criteria defined (in which case, everything matches) but must have at least the keyword action for it to be considered complete. Entries without the action keyword will be considered incomplete and hence will be rendered inactive.",
