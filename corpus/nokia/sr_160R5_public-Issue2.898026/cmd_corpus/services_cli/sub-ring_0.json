    "FuncDef": "This command additionally specifies this ring-id to be sub-ring as defined in G.80312. By declaring this ring as a sub-ring object, this ring will only have one valid path and the sub-ring will be connected to a major ring or a VPLS instance. The virtual-link parameter declares that a sub-ring is connected to another ring and that control messages can be sent over the attached ring to the other side of the sub-ring. The non-virtual channel parameter declares that a sub-ring may be connected to a another ring or to a VPLS instance but that no control messages from the sub-ring use the attached ring or VPLS instance. The non-virtual channel behavior is standard G.8032 capability.",
