    "FuncDef": "This command enables the use of the control word on pseudowire packets in VPLS and VPWS and enables the use of the control word individually on each mesh-sdp or spoke-sdp. By default, the control word is disabled. When the control word is enabled, all VPLS/VPWS packets, including the BPDU frames, are encapsulated with the control word when sent over the pseudowire. The T-LDP control plane behavior is the same as in the implementation of control word for VLL services. The configuration for the two directions of the Ethernet pseudowire should match.",
