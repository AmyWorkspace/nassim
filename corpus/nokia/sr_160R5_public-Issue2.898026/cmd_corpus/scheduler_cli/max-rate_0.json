    "PageTitle": "max-rate",
    "FuncDef": "This command defines an explicit maximum frame-based bandwidth limit for the port scheduler policies scheduler context. By default, when a scheduler policy is associated with a port or channel, the instance of the scheduler on the port automatically limits the bandwidth to the lesser of port or channel line rate and a possible egress-rate value (for Ethernet ports). If a max-rate is defined that is smaller than the port or channel rate, the expressed kilobits per second value is used instead. The max-rate command is another way to sub-rate the port or channel. This command can be used on channels only on the 7450 ESS and 7750 SR.",
