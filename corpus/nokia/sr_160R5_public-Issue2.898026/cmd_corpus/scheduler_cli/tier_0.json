Schedulers created within a tier can only be a child (take bandwidth from a scheduler in a higher tier). Tier levels increase sequentially with 1 being the highest tier. All tier 1 schedulers are considered to be root and cannot be a child of another scheduler. Schedulers defined in tiers other than 1 can also be root (parentless).",
