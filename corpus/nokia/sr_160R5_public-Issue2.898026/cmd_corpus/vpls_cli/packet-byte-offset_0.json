    "FuncDef": "This command adds or subtracts the specified number of bytes to the accounting function for each packet handled by the HSMDA queue. Normally, the accounting and leaky bucket functions are based on the Ethernet DLC header, payload and the 4 byte CRC (everything except the preamble and inter-frame gap). As an example, the packet-byte-offset command can be used to add the frame encapsulation overhead (20 bytes) to the queues accounting functions.",
