    "FuncDef": "This command enables the MEP to process service activation streams encapsulated in ETH-CFM LBM frames that are directed to the MEP. The MEP will be allocated additional resources to rapidly respond to a high-speed stream of LBM messages. A MEP created with this option will not validate any TLVs, will not validate the ETH-LBM MAC Address, and will not increment or compute any loopback statistics. Statistical computation and reporting is the responsibility of the test head-end. The ETH-CFM level of the high speed ETH-LBM stream must match the level of a MEP configured with this command. It must not target any lower ETH-CFM level the MEP will terminate. When the service activation test is complete, the MEP may be returned to standard processing by removing this command. If there is available bandwidth, the MEP will respond to other ETH-CFM PDUs, such as ETH-DMM marker packets, using standard processing.",
