This allows communication from I-VPLS services external to SPBM through this node. The SAP may be a regular SAP or MC-LAG SAP. The spoke-SDP may be an active/standby spoke. When used with MC-Lag or active/stand-by PWs the conditional static-mac must be configured. ISIDs declared this way become part of the ISID multicast and consume MFIBs.
