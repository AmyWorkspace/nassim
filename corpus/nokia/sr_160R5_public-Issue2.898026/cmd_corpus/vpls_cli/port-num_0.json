    "FuncDef": "This command configures the virtual port number which uniquely identifies a SAP within configuration bridge protocol data units (BPDUs). The internal representation of a SAP is unique to a system and has a reference space much bigger than the 12 bits definable in a configuration BPDU. STP takes the internal representation value of a SAP and identifies it with it s own virtual port number that is unique to every other SAP defined on the TLS. The virtual port number is assigned at the time that the SAP is added to the TLS. Since the order that the SAP was added to the TLS is not preserved between reboots of the system, the virtual port number may change between restarts of the STP instance.",
