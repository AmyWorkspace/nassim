    "FuncDef": "This command is applicable to simple SAPs configured on LAGs that are not part of any \"endpoint\" configurations or complicated resiliency schemes like MC-LAG with inter-chassis-backup (ICB) configurations. When configured, a simple LAG SAP will not be removed from the forwarding plane and flooded traffic (unknown unicast, broadcast and multicast) will be dropped on egress. This allows applicable control traffic that is extracted at the egress interface to be processed by the CPM. This command will not prevent a VPLS service from entering an Operational Down state if it is the last active connection to enter a non-operational state. By default, without this command, when a SAP on a LAG enters a non-operational state it is removed from the forwarding plane and no forwarding occurs to the egress.",
