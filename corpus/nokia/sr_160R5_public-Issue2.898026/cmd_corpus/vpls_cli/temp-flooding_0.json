    "FuncDef": "The temporary flooding is designed to minimize failover times by eliminating the time it takes to flush the MAC tables and if MVRP is enabled the time it takes for MVRP registration. Temporary flooding is initiated only upon xSTP TCN reception. During this procedure while the MAC flush takes place the frames received on one of the VPLS SAPs/pseudowires are flooded in a VPLS context which for MVRP case includes also the unregistered MVRP trunk ports. The MAC Flush action is initiated by the STP TCN reception or if MVRP is enabled for the data VPLS, by the reception of a MVRP New message for the SVLAN ID associated with the data VPLS. As soon as the MAC Flush is done, regardless of whether the temp-flooding timer expired or not, traffic will be delivered according to the regular FDB content which may be built from MAC Learning or based on MVRP registrations. This command provides a flood-time value that configures a fixed amount of time, in seconds, during which\nall traffic is flooded (BUM or known unicast) as a safety mechanism. Once the flood-time expires, traffic will be delivered according to the regular FDB content which may be built from MAC Learning or based on MVRP registrations. The temporary flooding timer should be configured in such a way to allow auxiliary processes like MAC Flush, MMRP and/or MVRP to complete/converge. The temporary flooding behavior applies to regular VPLS, VPLS instantiated with VPLS-template, IVPLS and BVPLS when MMRP is disabled.",
