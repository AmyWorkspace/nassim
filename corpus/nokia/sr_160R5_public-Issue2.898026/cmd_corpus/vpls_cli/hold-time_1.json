    "FuncDef": "This command enables the dampening timer and applies to both types of provisioned SAPs - end-station and UNI. When a value is configured for the timer, it controls the delay between detecting that the last provisioned SAP in VPLS goes down and reporting it to the MVRP module. The CPM will wait for the time specified in the value parameter before reporting it to the MVRP module. If the SAP comes up before the hold-timer expires, the event will not be reported to MVRP module.",
