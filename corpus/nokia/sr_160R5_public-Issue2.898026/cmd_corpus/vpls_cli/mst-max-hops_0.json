    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the number of hops in the region before BPDU is discarded and the information held for the port is aged out. The root bridge of the instance sends a BPDU (or M-record) with remaining-hop-count set to configured <max-hops>. When a bridge receives the BPDU (or M-record), it decrements the received remaining-hop-count by 1 and propagates it in BPDU (or M-record) it generates.",
