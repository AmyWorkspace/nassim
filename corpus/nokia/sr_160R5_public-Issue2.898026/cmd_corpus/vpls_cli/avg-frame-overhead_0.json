    "FuncDef": "This command configures the average frame overhead to define the average percentage that the offered load to a queue will expand during the frame encapsulation process before sending traffic on-the-wire. While the avg-frame-overhead value may be defined on any queue, it is only used by the system for queues that egress a SONET or SDH port or channel. Queues operating on egress Ethernet ports automatically calculate the frame encapsulation overhead based on a 20 byte per packet rule (8 bytes for preamble and 12 bytes for Inter-Frame Gap).",
