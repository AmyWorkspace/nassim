For example, if a queue has an MBS of 600 kbytes and the percentage reduction is configured to be 30% for the low drop tail, then the low drop tail will be at 420 kbytes and out-of-profile packets are not accepted into the queue if the queue depth is greater than the low drop tail value, and so will be discarded.",
