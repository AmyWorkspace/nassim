    "FuncDef": "This command enters the context to configure MAC move attributes. A sustained high re-learn rate can be a sign of a loop somewhere in the VPLS topology. Typically, STP detects loops in the topology, but for those networks that do not run STP, the mac-move feature is an alternative way to protect your network against loops.",
