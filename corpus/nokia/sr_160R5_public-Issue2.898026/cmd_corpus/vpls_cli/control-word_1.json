    "FuncDef": "This command enables the use of the control word on pseudowire packets in VPLS and enables the use of the control word individually on each mesh SDP or spoke-SDP. By default, the control word is disabled. When the control word is enabled, all VPLS packets, including the BPDU frames, are encapsulated with the control word when sent over the pseudowire. The T-LDP control plane behavior is the same as in the implementation of control word for VLL services. The configuration for the two directions of the Ethernet pseudowire should match. Thenoform of the command reverts the mesh SDP or spoke-SDP to the default behavior of not using the control word. The control word must be enabled to use MPLS-TP OAM on a static spoke-sdp terminating in a VPLS.",
