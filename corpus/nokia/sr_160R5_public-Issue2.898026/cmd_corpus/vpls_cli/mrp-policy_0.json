The Group BMACs will be derived from the ISIDs using the procedure used in the PBB solution. The Group MAC is standard OUI with the last 24 bits being the ISID value. If the policy-name refers to a non-existing mrp-policy the command should return error. Changes to a mrp-policy are allowed and applied to the SAP/SDPs under which the policy is referenced.",
