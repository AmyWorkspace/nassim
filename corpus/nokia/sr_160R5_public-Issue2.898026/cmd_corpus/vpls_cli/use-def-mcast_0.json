    "FuncDef": "Theuse-def-mcastoption prevents local installation of the ISIDs in the range in the MFIB and uses the default multicast tree instead for a B-VPLS. In a node that does not have I-VPLS or static-isids, this command prevents the building of an MFIB entry for this ISID when received in a SPBM TLV and allows the broadcast of ISID based traffic on the default multicast tree. If anisid-policyexists, the core nodes can have this policy to prevent connectivity problems when some nodes are advertising an ISID and others are not. In a I-VPLS service if the customer MAC (C-MAC) is unknown, a frame will have the Multicast DA for an ISID (PBB-OUI + ISID) flooded on the default multicast tree and not pruned.",
