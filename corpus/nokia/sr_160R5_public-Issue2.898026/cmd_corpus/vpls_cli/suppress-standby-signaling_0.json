    "FuncDef": "When this command is enabled, the pseudowire standby bit (value 0x00000020) will not be sent to T-LDP peer when the specified spoke is selected as a standby. This allows faster switchover as the traffic will be sent over this SDP and discarded at the blocking side of the connection. This is particularly applicable to multicast traffic.",
