    "FuncDef": "This command enables MVRP control in the VPLS instances instantiated using the templates for the specified vpls-group. That means the flooding FDB will be created empty and will be populated with endpoints whenever MVRP receives a declaration and a registration on a specific endpoint. Also the VLAN ID associated by the control VPLS with the instantiated VPLS will be declared on service activation by MVRP on all virtual MVRP ports in the control VPLS. Service activation takes place when at least one other SAP is provisioned and brought up under the data VPLS. This is usually a customer facing SAP or a SAP leading outside of the MVRP controlled domain.",
