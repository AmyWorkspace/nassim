    "FuncDef": "This command indicates how many hops a BPDU can traverse the network starting from the root bridge. The message age field in a BPDU transmitted by the root bridge is initialized to 0. Each other bridge will take the message_age value from BPDUs received on their root port and increment this value by 1. The message_age therefore reflects the distance from the root bridge. BPDUs with a message age exceeding max-age are ignored.",
