    "FuncDef": "This command enables class-based forwarding for packets that belong to one of the eight forwarding classes (be, l2, af,  l1, h2, ef, h1, and nc). For the LER role, class-based forwarding is performed in conjunction with ECMP. At LER, this function applies to packets whose prefixes resolve to an LDP FEC. This LDP FEC resolves to a set of IGP shortcuts (RSVP-TE LSPs). At LSR, this function applies to labeled LDP packets whose FEC resolves to an IGP shortcut. SeeClass-Based Forwarding of LDP Prefix Packets over IGP Shortcutsfor detailed information on this capability.",
