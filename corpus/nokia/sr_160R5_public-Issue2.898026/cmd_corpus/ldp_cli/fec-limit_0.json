{
    "PageTitle": "fec-limit",
    "FuncDef": "This command configures a limit on the number of FECs which an LSR will accept from a given peer and add into the LDP label database. The limit applies to the aggregate count of all FEC types including service FEC. Once the limit is reached, any FEC received will be released back to the peer. This behavior is different from the per-peer import policy which will still accept the FEC into the label database but will not resolve it.",
