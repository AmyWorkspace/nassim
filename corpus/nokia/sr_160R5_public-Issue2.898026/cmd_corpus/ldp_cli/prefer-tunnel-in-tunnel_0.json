    "FuncDef": "This command specifies to use tunnel-in-tunnel over a simple LDP tunnel. Specifically, the user packets for LDP FECs learned over this targeted LDP session can be sent inside an RSVP LSP which terminates on the same egress router as the destination of the targeted LDP session. The user can specify an explicit list of RSVP LSP tunnels under the Targeted LDP session or LDP will perform a lookup in the Tunnel Table Manager (TTM) for the best RSVP LSP. In the former case, only the specified LSPs will be considered to tunnel LDP user packets. In the latter case, all LSPs available to the TTM and which terminate on the same egress router as this target ed LDP session will be considered. In both cases, the metric specified under the LSP configuration is used to control this selection.",
