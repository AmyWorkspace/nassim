    "FuncDef": "This command enables the addition of the PE-ID TLV in the LDP MAC withdrawal (mac-flush) message, under certain conditions, and modifies the mac-flush behavior for interoperability with other vendors that do not support the flush-all-from-me vendor-specific TLV. This flag can be enabled on a per LDP peer basis and allows the flush-all-from-me interoperability with other vendors. When the pe-id-mac-flush-interop flag is enabled for a given peer, the current mac-flush behavior is modified in terms of mac-flush generation, mac-flush propagation and behavior upon receiving a mac-flush.",
