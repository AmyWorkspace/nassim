    "FuncDef": "This command enables LDP Fast-Reroute (FRR) procedures. When enabled, LDP uses both the primary next-hop and LFA next-hop, when available, for resolving the next-hop of an LDP FEC against the corresponding prefix in the routing table. This will result in LDP programming a primary NHLFE and a backup NHLFE into the forwarding engine for each next-hop of a FEC prefix for the purpose of forwarding packets over the LDP FEC.",
