    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the authentication key to be used between LDP peers before establishing sessions. Authentication uses the MD-5 message-based digest. Peer address has to be the TCP session transport address. If one or more transport addresses used in the Hello adjacencies to the same peer LSR are different from the LSR-ID value, the user must add each of the transport addresses to the authentication-key configuration as a separate peer. This means when the TCP connection is bootstrapped by a given Hello adjacency, the authentication can operate over that specific TCP connection by using its specific transport address.",
