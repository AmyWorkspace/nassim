    "FuncDef": "This command provides a means for an LDP router to advertise only the local IPv4 or IPv6 interfaces it uses to establish hello adjacencies with an LDP peer. By default, when a router establishes an LDP session with a peer, it advertises in an LDP Address message the addresses of all local interfaces to allow the peer to resolve LDP FECs distributed by this router. Similarly, a router sends a Withdraw Address message to of all its peers to withdraw a local address if the corresponding interface went down or was deleted.",
