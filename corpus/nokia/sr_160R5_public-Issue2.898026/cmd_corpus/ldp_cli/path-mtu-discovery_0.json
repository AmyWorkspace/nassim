    "FuncDef": "This command enables Path MTU discovery for the associated TCP connections. When enabled, the MTU for the associated TCP session is initially set to the egress interface MTU. The DF bit is also set so that if a router along the path of the TCP connection cannot handle a packet of a particular size without fragmenting, it sends back an ICMP message to set the path MTU for the given session to a lower value that can be forwarded without fragmenting.",
