The ip-src-monitoring is useful in subscriber management architectures that have routers between the subscriber and the BNG (router). In layer-3 aggregation scenarios all packets from all subscribers behind the same aggregation router will arrive with the same source MAC address and as such the mac-monitoring functionality can not differentiate traffic from different subscribers."
