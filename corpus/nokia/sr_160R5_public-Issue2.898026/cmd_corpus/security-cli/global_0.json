This login exec script is executed when any user (authenticated by any means including local user database, TACACS+, or RADIUS) opens a CLI session. This allows a user, for example, to define a common set of CLI aliases that are made available on the router for all users. This global login exec script is executed before any user-specific login exec files that may be configured.",
