    "FuncDef": "This command determines the scheme used to select the initial drop priority of extracted control plane traffic. The initial drop priority of extracted packets can be either low or high priority. The drop priority of the extracted packets can be subsequently altered by mechanisms such as CPU protection. High-priority traffic receives preferential treatment in control plane congestion situations over low-priority traffic.",

This is useful in networks where the DSCP and EXP markings can be trusted as the primary method to distinguish, protect, and isolate good terminating protocol traffic from unknown or potentially harmful protocol traffic instead of using the rate-based DCP and centralized CPU protection traffic marking/coloring mechanisms (for example, out-profile-rate and exceed-action low-priority)."
