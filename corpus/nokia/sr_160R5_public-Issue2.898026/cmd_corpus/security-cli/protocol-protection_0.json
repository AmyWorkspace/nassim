    "PageTitle": "protocol-protection",
    "FuncDef": "This command causes the network processor on the CPM to discard all packets received for protocols that are not configured on the particular interface. This helps mitigate DoS attacks by filtering invalid control traffic before it hits the CPU. For example, if an interface does not have IS-IS configured, then protocol protection will discard any IS-IS packets received on that interface.",
