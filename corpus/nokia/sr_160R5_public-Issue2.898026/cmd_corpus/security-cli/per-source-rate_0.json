A source is defined as a unique combination of SAP and MAC source address (mac-monitoring) or SAP and source IP address (ip-src-monitoring). The CPU will receive no more than the configured packet rate from each source (only certain protocols are rate limited for ip-src-monitoring as configured underinclude-protocolsin thecpu-protectionpolicy).
