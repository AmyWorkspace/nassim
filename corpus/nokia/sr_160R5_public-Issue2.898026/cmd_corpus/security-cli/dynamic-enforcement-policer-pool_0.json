    "PageTitle": "dynamic-enforcement-policer-pool",
    "FuncDef": "This command reserves a set of policers for use as dynamic enforcement policers for the Distributed CPU Protection (DCP) feature. Policers are allocated from this pool and instantiated as per-object-per-protocol dynamic enforcement policers after a local monitor is triggered for an object (such as a SAP or Network Interface). Any change to this configured value automatically clears the high water mark, timestamp, and failed allocation counts as seen under \"show card x fp y dist-cpu-protection\" and in the tmnxFpDcpDynEnfrcPlcrStatTable in the TIMETRA-CHASSIS-MIB. Decreasing this value to below the currently used/allocated number causes all dynamic policers to be returned to the free pool (and traffic returns to the local monitors).",
