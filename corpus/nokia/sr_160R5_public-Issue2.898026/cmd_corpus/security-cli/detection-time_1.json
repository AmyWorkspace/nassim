Thedetection-timeonly starts after the exceed-action hold-down is complete. If the policer detects another exceed during the detection count down then a hold-down is once again triggered before the policer re-enters the detection time (that is, the countdown timer starts again at the configured value). During the hold-down (and the detection-time), the policer is considered as in an \"exceed\" state.",
