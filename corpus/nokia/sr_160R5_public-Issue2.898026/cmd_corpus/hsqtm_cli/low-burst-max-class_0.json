    "FuncDef": "This command specifies which scheduling classes map to the low burst-limit threshold of the queue-level aggregate shaper. Each egress SAP or subscriber SLA profile instance (SPI), per port set of network interface queues and egress queue group template instance has an aggregate shaper that manages the maximum burst limit over a specified shaping rate. Each aggregate shaper supports two thresholds. As the scheduling rate for the set of queues increases, eventually the aggregate rate exceeds the rate limit and the aggregate burst limit starts to be consumed. If this continues, the low burst limit threshold is exceeded and the queues mapped to the scheduling classes associated with low threshold are removed from the scheduler. If the remaining aggregate rate (from the higher scheduling classes) continues to exceed the shaping rate, then the burst limit continues to be consumed and eventually the high burst limit threshold is exceeded. This causes the queues for all scheduling\nclasses to be removed from the scheduler.",
