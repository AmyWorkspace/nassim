    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the slope policy that is used to define the high, low, and exceed slopes within the port-class pool. The slope used on the egress queue for the packet that generated the buffer request is also used in the class-pool. The pool s current allocation amount is applied to the appropriate slope to derive the buffer rejection probability. The probability value is compared to a randomly generated number. If the probability decision generates a rejection or the buffer pool has no remaining free buffers, the buffer request fails and the arriving packet is discarded. Otherwise, a buffer is allocated as long as the mid-tier and root-tier buffer pools also honor the buffer request.",

If a slope policy with the specified name does not exist, the slope-policy command fails without modifying the slope behavior on the pool. A non-existent slope-policy error is generated. After a slope policy is associated with any HSQ queue or buffer pool, the policy cannot be deleted."
