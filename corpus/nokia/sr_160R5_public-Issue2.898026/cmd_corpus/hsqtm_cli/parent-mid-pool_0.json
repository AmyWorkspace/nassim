Use care when selecting a mid-pool in an active state (properly mapped to a root-pool with a non-zero allocation percentage). If a port-class pool is parented by an inactive mid-pool, the queues using the port-class pool are forced into an operational MBS setting of 0, causing all packet to be discarded. A port-class pool can be made inactive (no available buffers) by executingparent-mid-pool nonein the port-class pool context.",
