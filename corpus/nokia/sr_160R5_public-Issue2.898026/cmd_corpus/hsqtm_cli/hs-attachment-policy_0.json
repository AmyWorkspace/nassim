    "FuncDef": "This command specifies how the queues within an HSQ queue group associated with the SAP egress policy instance, egress queue group instance, or egress network queue policy instance attaches to the HSQ scheduling classes managed by the port scheduler. On the HSQ IOM, eight queues are allocated per egress SAP or subscriber SLA profile instance (SPI), or per egress (access or network) queue group instance, or per egress network port, numbered 1 through 8. The port scheduler maintains six scheduling classes numbered from 1 through 6 (6 being the highest relative priority and 1 being the lowest). The set of eight queues may also be placed into one of two local Weighted Round Robin (WRR) groups which collapse the member queues into a single scheduling class while providing a weighted fair distribution of scheduling opportunities per member. The attachment policy contains theattachmentcommands that map the queue IDs and WRR groups to the scheduling classes. The\nattachment policy also defines the mapping of the scheduling classes to the queue s aggregate shapers low and high burst limit thresholds.",
