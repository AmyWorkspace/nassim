The adaptation rule specifies the rules to compute the operational values while maintaining minimum offset. The min, max, and closest keywords are mutually exclusive.

The hardware chooses the appropriate timers and PIR leaky bucket behavior to ensure that the queues shaping rate is the closest possible value without going under the specified rate.."
