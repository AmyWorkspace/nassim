    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the slope policy to be used to define the high, low, and exceed slopes within the pool. The slope (high, low, or exceed) used on the egress queue for the packet that generated the buffer request is also used in the mid-pool from the applied slope policy. The pool s current allocation amount is applied to the appropriate slope to derive the buffer rejection probability. The probability value is compared to a randomly-generated number. If the probability decision generates a rejection decision or the buffer pool has no remaining free buffers, the buffer request fails and the arriving packet is discarded. Otherwise, a buffer is allocated as long as the port-class and root-tier buffer pools also honor the buffer request.",
