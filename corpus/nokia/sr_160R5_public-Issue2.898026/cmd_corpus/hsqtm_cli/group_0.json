A group is a scheduling component used to combine up to six consecutive scheduling classes into a single strict priority level. Each scheduling class within the group has an associated weight. When the scheduler is servicing the strict level associated with the group, the ratio of bandwidth allocated to each scheduling class within the group during congestion is relative to the ratio of the weight of each active member.",
