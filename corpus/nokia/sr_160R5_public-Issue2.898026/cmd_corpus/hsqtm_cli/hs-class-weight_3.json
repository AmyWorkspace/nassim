    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the class weight of this queue at its parent primary shaper, relative to the other queues and WRR groups in different HSQ queue groups in the same scheduling class. This allows the capacity available at the primary shaper scheduling class to be shared in a WRR manner between the HSQ queue group queues and WRR groups attached to that scheduling class. Thehs-class-weightweightparameter can be used to give unequal shares of the available capacity to different types of service offerings. This command is ignored for egress HSQ queue group queues, which are attached to an HS WRR group within an associated HS attachment policy. In this case, the configuration of thehs-class-weightis performed under thehs-wrr-groupwithin the network queue policy.",
