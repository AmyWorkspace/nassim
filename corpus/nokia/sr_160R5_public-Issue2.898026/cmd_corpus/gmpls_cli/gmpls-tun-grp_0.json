    "FuncDef": "This command configures a GMPLS tunnel group. A GMPLS tunnel group is a bundle of GMPLS LSPs providing an abstraction of the data bearers that are intended to be associated to one IP interface. This object allows, for example, end-to-end load balancing across the set of data bearers corresponding to a set of gLSPs. A gLSP is bound to an overlay tunnel group by a gLSP tunnel name at both the head end and the tail end UNI-C nodes of a gLSP. A sender-address may be optionally configured for the tail end of a gLSP in case overlapping GMPLS LSP tunnel names are used by different head end nodes.",
