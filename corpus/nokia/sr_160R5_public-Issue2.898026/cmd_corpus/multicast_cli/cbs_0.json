The queues CBS threshold is used when requesting buffers from the systems ingress buffer pool to indicate whether the requested buffer should be removed from the reserved portion of the buffer pool or the shared portion. When the queue s fill depth is below or equal to the CBS threshold, the requested buffer comes from the reserved portion. Once the queues depth exceeds the CBS threshold, buffers come from the shared portion.",
