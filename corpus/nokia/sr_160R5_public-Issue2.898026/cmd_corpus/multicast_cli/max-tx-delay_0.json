    "PageTitle": "max-tx-delay",
    "FuncDef": "This command specifies the time interval before the packet starts transmitting towards the destination. When an IGMP event is encoded and ready to be transported, a buffer for the packet is allocated (if not already existent). The events are written into this buffer. Along with the initial buffer creation, a timer is started. The trigger for the transmission of the packet is either the TX buffer being filled up to 1400 B, or the timer expiry, whichever comes first.",
