    "FuncDef": "This command defines an explicit ingress switch fabric multicast path assigned to a multicast channel. When defined, the channel is setup with the explicit path as its inactive path. When an explicit path is not defined, all multicast channels are initialized on the secondary path and when they start to consume bandwidth, they are moved to the appropriate path based on the channel attributes and path limitations. Explicit path channels are not allowed to move from their defined path.",
