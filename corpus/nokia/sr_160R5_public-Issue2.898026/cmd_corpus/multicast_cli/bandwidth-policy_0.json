    "FuncDef": "This command creates a multicast bandwidth policy. Bandwidth policies are used to manage the ingress multicast path bandwidth. Each forwarding plane supports multicast forwarding paths into the switch fabric. By default, two paths are available; the multicast high priority path and the multicast low priority path. Multicast packets are forwarded on either path based on the expedited or non-expedited (best-effort) nature of the queue the packets are scheduled from. The ingress forwarding plane uses the classification rules to determine the forwarding class of each multicast packet and uses the forwarding class to queue mapping to decide which ingress multipoint queue forwards the packet.",
