    "FuncDef": "This command defines the preference level threshold where records change from low congestion priority to high congestion priority. Congestion priority is used by the ingress multicast path queues to map packets entering the queue to either the low drop-tail or the MBS drop-tail threshold. In the event that congestion happens on the queue, the queue depth increases. As the queue depth increases beyond the low drop-tail, packets with low priority congestion priority are discarded. This leaves room in the queue for packets with high congestion priority until the queue reaches the MBS threshold.",
