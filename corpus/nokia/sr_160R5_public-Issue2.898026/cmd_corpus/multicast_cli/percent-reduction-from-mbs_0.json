    "FuncDef": "This command overrides the default percentage value used to determine the low drop-tail value for the queue. By default, 10 percent of the queue depth is reserved for high congestion priority traffic. When specified, thepercent-reduction-from-mbspercentage value is applied to the queues  MBS threshold. The resulting value is subtracted from the MBS to derive the low drop-tail threshold maintained by the queue. The low drop-tail threshold defines the point at which all low-congestion priority packets destined for the queue are discarded based on queue depth. Low- and high-congestion priority is derived from the multicast records preference value compared to the record s bundle priority threshold.",
