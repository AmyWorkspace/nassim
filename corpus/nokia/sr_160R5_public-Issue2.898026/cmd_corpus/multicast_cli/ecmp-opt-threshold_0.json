    "FuncDef": "This command defines the preference level threshold where multicast ECMP path management is allowed to dynamically optimize channels based on topology or bandwidth events. If the channels preference is equal to or less than the ecmp-opt-threshold, ECMP is allowed to move the channel between ECMP paths when bandwidth distribution events happen. Channels with a preference level higher than the threshold are moved during these events.",
