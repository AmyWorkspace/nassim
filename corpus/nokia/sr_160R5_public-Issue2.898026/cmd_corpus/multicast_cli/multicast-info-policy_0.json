    "FuncDef": "This command configures a multicast information policy. Multicast information policies are used to manage parameters associated with Layer 2 and Layer 3 multicast records. Multiple features use the configured information within the policy. The multicast ingress path manager uses the policy to decide the inactive and active state behavior for each multicast record using the ingress paths to the switch fabric. The system s multicast ECMP join decisions are influenced by the channel information contained within the policy.",
