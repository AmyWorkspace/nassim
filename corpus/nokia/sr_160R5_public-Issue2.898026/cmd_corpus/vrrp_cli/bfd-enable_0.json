    "FuncDef": "This commands assigns a bidirectional forwarding detect (BFD) session to a specific VRRP/SRRP instance. This BFD sessions provided a heartbeat mechanism that can be used to speed up the transition of the standby VRRP router to an active state. If the associated BFD session fails, the VRRP routers will immediately send a VRRP Advertisement message. In addition, the standby VRRP router(s) will transition to a Master state to speed convergence. The normal VRRP election process will then take place based on the Advertisement messages sent by all VRRP routers.",
