    "FuncDef": "This command creates a context to configure an event set threshold within a lag-port-down priority control event. The weight-down command defines a sub-node within the lag-port-down event and is uniquely identified with the lag-ports-down-weight parameter. Each weight-down node within the same lag-port-down event node must have a unique lag-ports-down-weight value. Each weight-down node has its own priority command that takes effect whenever that node represents the current threshold. A single LAG can use either weight-threshold or port threshold. The command is required for correct operation on mixed port-speed LAGs and can be used for non-mixed port-speed LAGs as well.",
