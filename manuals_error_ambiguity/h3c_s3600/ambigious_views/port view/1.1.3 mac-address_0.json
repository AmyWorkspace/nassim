    "FuncDef": "Use the mac - address command to add/modify a MAC address entry. Use the undo mac - address command to remove one or more MAC address entries. When being executed in port view, these two commands only apply to the current port. In this case, the interface keyword is unnecessary. If the MAC address you input in the mac - address command already exists in the MAC address table, the system will modify the attributes of the corresponding MAC address entry according to your settings in the command. You can remove all MAC address entries (unicast MAC addresses only) concerning a specific port, or remove a specific type of MAC address entries, such as the addresses learnt by the system, dynamic or static MAC address entries configured, or blackhole addresses.",
