    "FuncDef": "Use the ip address command to specify an IP address and mask for a VLAN or loopback interface. Use the undo ip address command to remove an IP address and mask of a VLAN or loopback interface. By default, a VLAN or loopback interface has no IP address. Generally, it is enough to configure one IP address for an interface. However, you can configure up to five IP addresses for an interface so that it can be connected to several subnets. Among these IP addresses, one is the primary IP address and all the others are secondary ones. The relationship between the primary address and the secondary addresses is as follows: Note that a VLAN interface cannot be configured with a secondary IP address if the interface has been configured to obtain an IP address through BOOTP or DHCP.
