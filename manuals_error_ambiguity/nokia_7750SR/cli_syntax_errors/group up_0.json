    "FuncDef": "This command configures the number of seconds to wait before notifying clients monitoring this group when its operational status transitions from down to up. A value of zero indicates that transitions are reported immediately to monitoring clients. The up time option is a must to achieve fast convergence: when the group comes up, the monitoring MH site which tracks the group status may wait without impacting the overall convergence; there is usually a pair MH site that is already handling the traffic.",
