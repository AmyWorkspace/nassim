Reachability is determined by whether or not there is a route in the routing table by which the target address can be reached. Before sending a trap to a target address, the SNMP module asks the PIP module if there is either an in-band or out-of-band route to the target address. If there is no route to the SNMP target address, the SNMP module saves the sequence-id of the first event that will be missed by the trap target. When the routing table changes again so that there is now a route by which the SNMP target address can be reached, the SNMP module replays (for example, retransmits) all events generated to the SNMP notification log while the target address was removed from the route table."
