    "ExtraInfo": "Usage Scenario Before tracing a service, you must make sure that the service is accessed; otherwise, no tracing information is output. In addition, you need to make sure that the CPU usage on the Main Processing Unit does not exceed 70%. Before outputting tracing information to a log server, you must make sure that the log server exists and is properly configured. Precautions This command is used for fault diagnosis only. It consumes a great number of resources when the device is running normally and may affect services. Recreate tracing objects after board restart or master/slave switchover.",
