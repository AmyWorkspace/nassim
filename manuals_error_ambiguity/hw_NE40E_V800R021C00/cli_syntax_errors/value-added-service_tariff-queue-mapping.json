CS7, CS6, EF, AF4, AF3, AF2, AF1, and BE are in descending order of priority. Precautions This command is supported only on the admin VS. The eight parameters in the value-added-service tariff-queue-mapping command are mandatory. You can specify them as required. The command updates information about online users and cannot be consecutively configured. The command can be configured again only after information about online users is updated.",
