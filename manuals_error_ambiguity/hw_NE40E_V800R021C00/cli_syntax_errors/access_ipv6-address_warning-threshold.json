When the percentage of the number of IPv6 addresses of access users on a device in the device's IPv6 specification (1M) exceeds the upper alarm threshold or goes below the lower alarm threshold, the device generates an alarm. Precautions In VS mode, this command is supported only by the admin VS.",
