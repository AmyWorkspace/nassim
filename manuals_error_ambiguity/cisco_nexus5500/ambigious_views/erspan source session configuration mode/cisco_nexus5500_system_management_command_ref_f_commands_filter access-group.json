    "ExtraInfo": "ACL filtering allows you to filter SPAN and ERSPAN traffic so that you can reduce bandwidth congestion. An ACL is a list of permissions associated to any entity in the system; in the context of a monitoring session, an ACL is a list of rules which results in the spanning of traffic that matches the ACL criteria, saving bandwidth for more meaningful data. The filter applies to all sources in the session.\nCommand Default: None",
