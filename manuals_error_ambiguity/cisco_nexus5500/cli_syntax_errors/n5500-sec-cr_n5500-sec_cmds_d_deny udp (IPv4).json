If you do not specify a sequence number, the switch adds the rule to the end of the ACL and assigns to it a sequence number that is 10 greater than the sequence number of the preceding rule. Use the resequence command to reassign sequence numbers to rules."

When the conditions of more than one rule are satisfied, the switch enforces the rule with the lowest sequence number.Source and DestinationYou can specify the source and destination arguments in one of several ways. In each rule, the method that you use to specify one of these arguments does not affect how you specify the other argument. When you configure a rule, use the following methods to specify the source and destination arguments:Address and network wildcard-You can use an IPv4 address followed by a network wildcard to specify a host or a network as a source or destination. The syntax is as follows:IPv4-address network-wildcardThis example shows how to specify the source argument with the IPv4 address and network wildcard for the 192.168.67.0 subnet:switch(config-acl)# deny udp 192.168.67.0 0.0.0.255 anyAddress and variable-length subnet mask-You can use an IPv4 address followed by a variable-length subnet mask (VLSM) to specify a host or a network as a source or destination. The syntax is as follows:IPv4-address/prefix-lenThis example shows how to specify the source argument with the IPv4 address and VLSM for the 192.168.67.0 subnet:switch(config-acl)# deny udp 192.168.67.0/24 anyHost address-You can use the host keyword and an IPv4 address to specify a host as a source or destination. The syntax is as follows:host IPv4-addressThis syntax is equivalent to IPv4-address /32 and IPv4-address 0.0.0.0.This example shows how to specify the source argument with the host keyword and the 192.168.67.132 IPv4 address:switch(config-acl)# deny udp host 192.168.67.132 anyAny address-You can use the any keyword to specify that a source or destination is any IPv4 address. For examples of the use of the any keyword, see the examples in this section. Each example shows how to specify a source or destination by using the any keyword.UDP Port NamesWhen you specify the protocol argument as udp , the port argument can be a UDP port number, which is an integer from 0 to 65535. It can also be one of the following keywords:biff -Biff (mail notification, comsat, 512) bootpc -Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) client (68) bootps -Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) server (67) discard -Discard (9) dnsix -DNSIX security protocol auditing (195) domain -Domain Name Service (DNS, 53) echo -Echo (7) isakmp -Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (5) mobile-ip -Mobile IP registration (434) nameserver -IEN116 name service (obsolete, 42) netbios-dgm -NetBIOS datagram service (138) netbios-ns -NetBIOS name service (137) netbios-ss -NetBIOS session service (139) non500-isakmp -Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (45) ntp -Network Time Protocol (123) pim-auto-rp -PIM Auto-RP (496) rip -Routing Information Protocol (router, in.routed, 52) snmp -Simple Network Management Protocol (161) snmptrap -SNMP Traps (162) sunrpc -Sun Remote Procedure Call (111) syslog -System Logger (514) tacacs -TAC Access Control System (49) talk -Talk (517) tftp -Trivial File Transfer Protocol (69) time -Time (37) who -Who service (rwho, 513) xdmcp -X Display Manager Control Protocol (177)\nCommand Default:A newly created IPv4 ACL contains no rules.",
